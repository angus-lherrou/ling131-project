and setting up a final vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nI'm Jeanie do pre in Washington Senators are closing in on the first test vote for judge Brett Kavanaugh the motion in the next hour is simply whether to end debate and move on to a final vote arguing for Kavanaugh was GOP Senator Charles Grassley\nThis should have been a respectable and dignified confirmation process\nSarah only a handful of undecided boats at this point as the Kavanaugh nomination to the Supreme Court hangs in the balance\nLove if you're talking about love\nI can understand the abandonment of reason and logic sometimes at work at Brooks out often it doesn't but it comes part and parcel with\nLove but outside of love\nI like reason and logic and this guy wants to balance\nI'll tell you this this is my point of view is both sides when they get into these a teen uniform situations are ugly to me when I see a sign that says we believe all survivors all I see on that side is\nWe don't believe reason and logic have a place in this conversation so I'm Out\nBut if I you know the if if I come across the Trump or who's like I've never disagreed with Trump I agree with what Trump's going to say two pm next Thursday I find both of those sides\nTo be completely ugly I Believe in you I Believe in in dependents I Believe in independence thought independent thinking I Believe is you see the world as a collection of

don't like them and you run them through your brain through what you know\nWhat you know you don't know\nAnd your experiences up to now in your life you put it all together and you come up with your opinion\nBut if your opinion is that you believe a woman who's going to say that something happened next Thursday I find you to be as stupid as the person who says I agree with whatever Trump tweets next Thursday\nI'll listen to the allegation and I'll read the sweet and I'll run it through my brain one in the hell do you have a brain for if you're not going to use it why are people so willing\nTo give up the responsibility of thought on the left and on the right I'd made life easy anybody who makes an allegation I Believe them see I don't even have to turn on my brain do you know how much energy I save by not having to consider each case on its own\nThat's stupidity bordering on madness oh But Eric it's been the other way for so long I agree but also\nThe wrote the hell is paid for the good intentions do you remember that the road to hell is paved with good intentions\nThere's every good reason in this country for women to finally stand up and say enough is enough with
