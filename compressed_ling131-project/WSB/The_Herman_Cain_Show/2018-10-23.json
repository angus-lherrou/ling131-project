wasn't the new boring flag no I wouldn't even know it was the old controversial floods right\nOr is there video footage of this I was reading this article for news articles so there's a reporters that were said that they were there is she saying yes or no I did it or I didn't do it uh that's important to find out if she's actually admitting to do it if she did it I think she should just come\nClean I have not seen a statement from the ... campaign yet another first of all it's\nAll she was on you know no matter what you feel about that issue she ultimately was on the winning side there's a new flag now\nThere's a way out of this for her is that she said you know I was younger I was maybe a little full of myself I wouldn't have done it that way now but because she ended up being on the winning side I think she can we go out of it but if she didn't she needs to just say look I was young I was ... militants\nAnd I'm older now I'm wiser now I understand how to get things changed I think most people whether they're on the left or the right we're a bit more militant when they were young\nWith their political ideas as long as she comes forward and says look that was silly I was younger\nThat's what it's saying she's saying that uh it during her college years or Georgia was at a crossroads struggling with how to overcome racially diverse of issues are good examples of the confederacy and she was just trying to say that she was on that side of\nHistory I Know it was an Arizona okay that's not enough okay she's I hate that state that the right side of it or what led history decide who's on the right side of history and stop trying to predict it um\nI don't think that's enough I think you've got to go one step further you want to be the governor now and you know if the polls are correct you might be\nYou want to be the governor now so you got to speak to everybody and there's nothing wrong with saying look I think I was on the right side of that issue but I was young and you know with a head full of ... like a lot of young people and I'm older now and I realized that if you want to effect change\nYou do it in different ways that's why I'm had a political career that's why I'm running for\nGovernor but they won't do it you know this is a this gets to what is bothering me about this whole\nCamp Abrams thing both sides are running really\nThe less less I think lackluster campaigns so why and I figured it out of the reasons this campaign is boring is because both candidates\nThey're not so much try playing to win as playing to not lose so Abrams is doing everything she can to not come off as a militant progressive socialist so she's\nBoring herself out right camp I\nHaven't seen a shotgun and the general election like shot guns were everywhere way to to buy\nThis weird isn't this weird you'd think if there was a danger to ... to a gun sales in Georgia it wouldn't come from your competitors in a Republican primary what Republican in Georgia is going to take your guns away if that truly is an issue you'd think it would be front and center\nWhen you're up against a Democrat in a general election but no guns\nBut they've done some sort of research so while she's doing everything she can to not appear to be a progressive militant\nHe's doing everything he can do not appear to be a a route and to gun carrying you know outlaw or whatever the image was but he was getting across in the primaries that worked for him\nShe has a new ad coming out with a bunch of women in bikinis shooting at targets with machine guns yeah he knows that have not seen those yeah yeah I Know she's a reading those ... going that direction yeah\nPeople believe you you know people listening although they don't believe you know I haven't seen that spot yet\nI Wonder what am I going to see that but you see what I'm saying they're both if you're planning to when you just go out there like ... like Abrams yeah you know what I'm going to cop to it I was young and it it was important to me and it wasn't burning an American flag it was a flag that I felt was shameful\nAnd I was young and I wouldn't do it that way now I think that would be refreshing but she doesn't want to go there or touch anything that makes her look militant\nAnd camp doesn't want to go anywhere or do anything that makes him look like the n._r._a. poster child when for some reason during the primaries he was all about that and I can't quite understand where that comes from ... from the electric\nElectorate are Republicans in Georgia worry that other Republicans are going to take their guns away that does not make sense to me I don't see a big Republican movement in the state of Georgia\nTo take your guns away anybody would have gotten that nomination would have been just fine in the eyes of the n._r._a. and yet now we get to where it's a Republican versus Democrat who is progressive\nWho has ideas about gun control that no one in the Republican primary did and yet we don't see we don't see kept shotgun so he's done some sort of a\nPolling behind the scenes some sort of research that says this was going to help them so that's why the campaign to so disappointing on both sides they're both trying to to uh appear to be way more moderate than they actually are right Brian Kemp\nOh yeah that's right I'm In favor of everything that you might like\n[noise] [noise] I also have a shotgun but you know ah I don't see it you don't see the shot I could see that shot than one more time is your biggest fan right here I take a great they are because for me for all time's sake yeah oh my [laughter]\nSo you already got her vote so you got to go out and get a T shirt until I found that shot well do you get [noise] like we're on take ... yeah [noise]\nI guess [laughter]\nBut you've got a real good policy all the point is that he's got your vote he's not shooting around anymore\nWell I got to keep her voting also try to give people vote for him I don't care\nWhat about that trucker you to go pick up the illegals maybe that's why your kid pace but it's so boring you're busy I'm busy picking out of an odd that was all be yes\nI Know what I\nTold you that was all be asked what about the guy that last with the busted is he out rounding up a legal sorted out oh yeah and if I don't win I don't take the bus I Am I being naive here that was all but yes\nNo I got in Murray Hill near the temporary wall along the border cause a caravan [laughter] ...\nWell I don't think we have a border with Mexico will be a while before\nWe ... them or you know Alabama\nYeah [laughter]\nSo that's my theory as to why it's just such a kind of boring thing this campaign neither one will do will will say anything striking is there a is there at the rate\nIs they
