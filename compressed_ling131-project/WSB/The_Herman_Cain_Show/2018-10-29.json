political targets of President Trump forty eight degrees in Atlanta on WSBIU meteorologist Kirk malice sunny in a high today near Seventy that's a ... meter so what about Halloween Wednesday\nBut the larger part of that when you expand out on it is quite obvious if you step back and stop thinking about who you're going to vote for him why for two minutes\nWhat's obvious is that both sides\nHave gone wrong to kill asleep hyperbolic in their rhetoric political rhetoric even something that doesn't seem\nWell I Would say this isn't dangerous but everything is hyperbole how many times we heard in this cycle this is the most important election of your lifetime no\nIt's not I'm a repeat that no it's not let me take that a little one step further\nIt's not even close it's the next election\nYou live in America you decide how things are running around here and we do it quite often that's the beauty of America you as a voter have a voice\nOn the national level every two years on the local level\nMore often than you notice if you're like most people you miss more local elections than you actually get involved with if you like most voters you'll get involved in the local elections that coincide with national elections or state elections\nThat's what makes a things like the pipe bomb guy and what happened uh in Pittsburgh\nI don't know if you could make those especially in Pittsburgh even worse but even more should be more unlikely in this country in this country\nYou're constantly asked who do you want to be led by who do you want to be led by and you constantly tell people and you swing wildly back and forth\nAnd those are the forces that are in play here those are the important forces but no this is not the most important election of your lifetime not by a long shot it's another election see what I'm doing here I'm turning down the heat a little bit [laughter]\nBecause that's all they can be done it's an individual thing\nI'm sick and tired of being preached to about peace and unity by the same people who say some of the most disgusting things imaginable on social media about people they disagree with and that goes for you on the left and that goes for you on the right\n\nGuy who ... who sent a pipe bomb suit thankfully none of them went off and\nThe idiots who shot up the synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAre both highly on American\nHighly on American but I bet you before they were both in jail if you talk to them I bet you they had opinions about everything but never understood the beauty of the country that they live in\nTheir outliers now\nOn on on a on a on a meta\nScale you know what do we do about the fact\nThat people can get this guy never got in trouble with the law so he was able to get guns you live in a free country this is one of these situations that is not resolved bubble\nYou live in a free country so you can take that one of two ways most people take it and run with it freedom liberty understanding that there are still limits freedom doesn't mean there aren't limits that there aren't parameters\nAnd then you have other people the minority of people who take advantage of freedom\nWho underneath the radar put together the recipe for for terror all legally\nThey're not they're they're they're not seeing on the radar and under the radar they they do things legally and they put things together and they put a plan together and you don't see them and you don't know him until too late to like the pop up\nWhat can be done about that I got a microphone in front of me and ah people been telling me since I started doing this your audience wants to answer from you your audience wants a solution I don't have an answer and I don't have a solution you live in a free country\nWhat do you deal with that all we can do is work on ourselves you are never going to get to a point where you can identify the guy who shot up that synagogue in Pittsburgh two weeks ago\n'cause my understanding is he didn't have you didn't have Pryor's and no one\nIs going to stand for a country where we go out we think you're dangerous even though you haven't done anything so you're not going to get the full freedoms everyone else gets he'd be locking everybody up enough ...\nEverybody looks so what can be done look within this wasting tried I don't know because the people\nBe kind to people that you disagree with\nGo out of your way\nTo be accommodating to the views of others without being bullied by them or about without that being used over your head but I don't want to hear people talking about the harsh rhetoric just from one side when I Know that I no longer checks social media why is that\nBecause it was nothing\nAlmost nothing but harsh rhetoric from all sides\nSo we can look in the mirror we can do a little self examination but that doesn't make us guilty of things we didn't do it just says how can I Do better that's the only control you have\nI guess my messages oh negative this morning because see in a free society\nYou were going to have people who abused that freedom\nTo harm others\nAre you willing to give up your free society\nI'm not\nBut these tragedies certainly make it more\nLikely that we think well maybe a law here or a law there last year or a law there is just another law here law there that these more on the psychopaths have to go around and they will\nMhm so take advantage of your time and your place look inward leave the camp ground a little cleaner than you found it\nStops thinking that your ideas are the most important ideas of all time and they must be put in place or it's it's

suddenly has been annoying me\n... ... everybody has the same headline it's like whatever somebody goes up before Congress every headline news so and so gets grilled isn't there another\n... every headline about Halloween winning the second box office weekend in a row has scared of Halloween scares away the competition and St Louis scares up a hundred million dollar lean viciously slashes a competition now\nYou know you're thinking yeah I Know you're sitting in\nSo I figured that's what he would have said oh no absolutely not notice and this is not you just happened to be in a lot I Do not mean you yeah you of course\nAre filling in for the great charity I'm a motive and doing a fantastic job it's just I wanted to point that out anytime you see that every headline saying hey take that into your mind and remember it when it's a headline that says about politics\nJustice lazy now you may not know much about the issue it's like\nIf you've ever been covered by local news\nBecause I've been in radio they'd come in to cover this or that from time to time and then you watch what actually gets put on the local news that night\nAnd it's nothing like your point of view you realize oh with the reporter knew the story they wanted before they walked in and I was just a prop when that happens it and people so if you're let's say you know a lot about tennis\nAnd in a tennis story comes up on the local news and you say oh that's the they don't understand how tennis words and all of us know something about something right but none of us knows about everything\nThis is your window and whenever the local news or the national news coverage something that you actually know and you recognize how wrong they are or how they didn't get it in context just take that and apply it to everything else that you don't know as as well about so\nThat's all I'm saying to you if you see that every headline about Halloween has the word scared scared scary something like that in it\nYou know about movies so I assume\nWhen they're covering politics things you don't know much about there being just as lazy as as when you notice it uh so how much does it make over the weekend uh thirty two minute I think it's going to get married you saw told me was correct yeah I really enjoyed it it's a slasher thing people ah get all you know like\n... some of that if that's your thing but it's I think it's just sort of an overall entertaining film with strong characters and Larry good right interesting very funny we live in a society where uh it's okay to slash people's faces and all that

U.S withdrawal from the landmark missile treaty\nOh yeah you know what I saw this story and\nYou know we talk radio we have twenty four hour news things we have to fill things up I'm sure today you'll see a couple of round tables till the pundits on twenty four hour news and some people see this is just that Donald Trump you see what's going on now runs his they're preparing for war what's this headline news and this is a good thing\nThe headline here is a test for you dear listener maybe you're younger\nOr maybe you're older and you just haven't learned your lesson yet but if you're somebody who is uh just getting turned down to the world of politics current events you're just starting to care this is a test\nAs to whether or not\nYou actually know what you're talking about and this is how it works if you read the headline like this and you take it seriously at all\nYou do not know what you're talking about you haven't been around politics long enough\nTo to have any sort of

says they're cheating and he says that well that means the deal is dead\nLet's move on let's do something else it's also a good it's a good idea to pull out of this treaty because it had just run its course in history it was a treaty between the United states and Russia but we have other entities now North Korea China\nThey're not signatories to this\nSo they so that they're not limited on the long range missiles so you end up in a situation where even if this treaty was being enforced properly it would allow other countries who didn't signed a treaty\nTo get ahead of you militarily I'm all for treaties I'm for treaties that work especially when it comes to nukes and deliverable ... there's a deliverable nuclear missiles\nAh but if it's not working is not working but the most important
