weekend where\nEverything I touched turned well the opposite of gold and I'm starting to get tired of it I'm into sports I Am considering at the age of fifty for just quitting sports altogether everybody that I wanted to win last\nMy stupid bills got spanked by the Colts football teams\nYou know if you don't know I'm from western New York so the falcons who played tonight we'll see how they do\nNot not doing very well this year a lot of injuries everything and so after my bills got killed him I'm rooting for Tampa Bay to lose for the falcons a day when he got a much rooting for the Panthers to when I'm going to lose for the falcons you they go back and winning it\nEvery single thing that I wanted to happen didn't happen this weekend the NASCAR race was boring and I'm thinking to myself here I Am fifty four years old\nI'm successful I have a right to be happy on the weekend what if I take in yesterday and my wife and I take it a jaunt up north and gone to pick apples all day what am I had a better day I've got an easy solution for you\nWhat do these rules has become sort of look you don't want that to happen\nI don't feel like I'm a mercenary you know I I feel as if maybe I should be hired out by bulldogs fans to root for Alabama because anybody I root for who is in the end and definitely doesn't get no team I have ever rooted for\nHas gone all the way and won the championship and then\nAnd then you look at Alan I'm not ready to go up to the woods\nYet [laughter] you know\nYou look at it the red Sox are going into the world series again and I knew the courage to me just like if I had been born in Boston\nEverything that I rooted for would be way to do is I I feel like a sore loser is and I feel like at fifty four I'm not superstitious person but you know sometimes the cards just follow a certain way and I feel like after all of these years\nI should realize that the teams I root for are never going to win a championship so why go through with it\nWell not just right now just cut it cut it lives\nWell the dogs didn't lose as we can get a bye week by week so you can you can you can hang on that and then also the falcons could win tonight I don't want to hurt these\nBulldog stands by continuing to show up and root for their favorite team because I Am an ex I recognize this mean for heaven's sakes I'm a bills fan\nWe lost four Super Bowls in a row can anybody even put their mind around the sheer terror of that I think it's time for me to get the mess\nFrom the universe Eric your teams are never going to win so therefore you is your weekends wisely and go out and enjoy yourself you deserve it you're a success you deserve a happy weekend I think that's what I'm going for the future let's do this\nHeadline for Monday I have a twenty second\nBrian Kemp was out there in the newsroom earlier he was almost got Slater all man and re Italian man that's what we're doing the clean up now because he got out of hand [noise]\nI got some clean up the mountain is favored\nThere in the way I wanted to go to the bathroom or like hey can I get by here All right okay go ahead do your thing I said that mhm [noise] so\nUh and and I think that the people were thinking that I Would want to have them on no disrespect to anybody running for governor a camp Abrams Mets a two percent are you actually running it's OK mess trying these trying I guess uh\nYeah what did they give me there's an evening is Ted Ted and his cabinet club at MIT [laughter] what give me that no matter\nWhat he's a God was talking about is the libertarian so I Would lean toward him and I will be voting this year but uh yeah I my feeling is that their job is to be boring if you're this close to an election\nYour job is to make sure you don't go on a show like the von Hester doctrine and say something that is perceived as outrageous whether it is or it isn't so nothing against any of them but we're not having anybody know politicians are are going to be on so hit me with some headline\nFor early voting has tripled in the first week of voting for the mid term election that's a triple from the last maternal\nI see what I don't understand is you hear these stories here in W S P\n... by the way and I yeah I was gonna say and elsewhere if I'm being honest not ... but three hour wait I thought the idea of early voting was that you just you you didn't stand in line on on election day it seems silly to me first of all of them out in the early voting think it's stupid but\nIf you're going to have it open twenty polling they open one and the city of Atlanta now to or something like that seems really bizarre to me maybe I'm just lucky the place that I vote is the easy in and out I mean even even a presidential election\nWill not to mention one minute they're still two debates that have to happen one one obviously will be here on WSBIU radio show and they could really make a mistake right we're when does that does that a lead it's the the couple of days before\nThe election right so ... everybody's voted and then you're going to have the debates doesn't make any sense to me I'm Glad we're having the debates but why didn't they happened a month ago but if you're going to have early voting in the state and you're still going to have debates\nI got an idea let's talk to each other let's have the debates at least one of the debates\nBecause we really haven't heard from these people now I don't know anything you're given that caused the ah the contest is going on now and the ridiculous commercials that both sides are running I don't know a damn thing about either I Know who I probably agree with more just based on political philosophy\nBut I I don't I'm not interested in what ONE Campaign dug up about another person and just the lies that go back and for for ... I mean I've met Stacey Abrams she doesn't strike me as somebody who's looking to spread pedophilia to the state of Georgia that's ridiculous and then her commercials about camp\nIs trying to keep fifty two thousand minorities from voting is not true it's ridiculous so I have no idea what they think about things that they would actually do as governor of the state of Georgia\nHow ridiculous is that\nHow many pedophile your issues do you think will come up state wide in Georgia in the next four years I'll tell ya zero\nThere's nothing to the idea of fifty two thousand people not being able to vote so that will not come up a lot of issues would come up in the next four years and not one single one but I can see if any importance\nIs being talked about so it's just an idiotic campaign I almost feel like both sides are playing not to lose the that's why the debates take place so late\nThey're they're doing a great job in the ads to your point of muddy the waters to the point where you really don't they're not focusing on what is like Frank\nThey don't focus on on those ads me a guy with a brain those ads on our main [laughter] somebody you could just look at something it's got a BS detector and isn't afraid to call anyone out whether I voted for him before if I voted for their party I don't care how many times I vote for your party if I smell your be yes\nI'm a I'm a I'm going to bring it up and this is all be yes I'd like to see one of these two campaigns without one commercial that address is one issue that will fundamentally affect the people the state of Georgia in the next four years ... transportation I'd like to see something on that\nOut to Atlanta centric [laughter]\n... [laughter] it's\nBeen only run in Atlanta that I suppose [laughter] you know now it looks as most of the a lot of the issues in a state like Georgia as far as commercials go are kind of boring you know crops and you know that's the farming and to most people it's kind of boring but those are the\nBest the economy of the state and a good politician I think a really really good politician is a kind of dry and boring but you you get you they they\nInstill a sense of confidence and you because like you know what I'm off enjoy my life and for some reason you decided to be a policy wonk [laughter] and really steep to yourself and they're so so I can go on partying I'm going to reward you with the power you seek so you can go do the things that's why that's really when it comes down\nTo but I I just think that this is the most idiotic you'd think that there are no issues of substance in the state of Georgia and of course that's not true but ah go out there and only vote stand in line for three hours so you don't have to stand in line for forty five minutes on election day that makes sense to me next door\nWell President Trump was busy tweeting on Saturday Night and among washy tweeted I'm outraged Idaho right and he did his support again for Brian Kemp so he he's recognizing that he realized that uh the tweet that he gave before a when ... was up against Casey Cagle really kind of took him over the top yeah\nThat well but that was in the Republican primary everybody was a Trump ... involved there how this the midterms are going to be a good test and\nHow much ah how much of that magic is Trump's still have with swing voters independents people like that and so we don't expect to see that much happened this week but there's certainly can't hurt
