this weekend and the the walk away or not a march happened this weekend white conservative on Capitol Hill and one of the leading boy there's a wide reserve it is and walk away\nOr individual handed when a young black conservative leading the charge and the conversation taking the narrative\nBack and she did that just this week when she owned a conversation with crystal ball at MSNBC\nAbout Charlie part of this conversation is that they are you concerned about the color of the White House um why why would you ask that question\nThey as you speak about black as well and I want to live like a let's get to where they are glad that that's why did you ask that question today because why they can and I needed and about that\nBecause you're bringing a whole group of young African American leader so I said this is something that I talk about often it that many last light levels don't realize that you put on that\nThe racism and caution that ... guy had high the U.S is that you place it away and how they're going to assure that way okay yeah I think that having a conversation about ... at least shapes fall and applying that we're shifting away everywhere I don't agree with that\nIf they don't look a little quaint that color scheme let's say apple I thought that tells us that the president but his dad and try to fill up a conversation that's surrounded by ray laugh or they're running I that I\nCan just throw in having a discussion with the well actually owning a conversation with a crystal ball on MSNBC this week uh as the precursor to black conservatives are visiting the White House or a large\nAnd ah walk away or the walk away march that occurred this weekend so you know she's absolutely right about that I talk about that a lot of talking about this exact topic a lot on my show we have Stacey Abrams who's running on skin color\nHow many times have you heard that the first black female so if it's not that we're running on our gender it's our skin color because we have the melanin worship right our own Atlanta mayor ran on it\nAnd one poorly on black girl magic rhetoric while trying to convince us that she's here to unify Atlanta sorry that does not make for an authentic hashtags okay listen the only reason\nThat people are offended by anything is because they think they're supposed to be especially\nAround race we've had eight years of Obama telling us we should be offended by our past by our differences buyer\nNationality by our successes by our individual ism that's liberalism that's the mental illness and spit in a spiritual disorder of liberalism it denies the God given created right to the uniquely different and to celebrate our differences\nTo forgive our past to live sober labor guarding our sovereignty as a

refused to take action rock yeah bad for Georgia me just can't be trusted\nThey the ... there was a mental deliverance which will pay for a credit card in Georgia and when you\nAsked me about ... media group station\n[noise] twenty four hour news weather and traffic five and a um so\nWhat do we do today is really to talk through if you're in that middle ground where you just you know you're supposed to do it this way but it's still doesn't feel right\nI Want to maybe walk through the the kind of the reality of investing again investing mix between what you think is going to happen and what you can tolerate that actually happens in tolerate by going through a week like this and that's followed by following a couple of really rough weeks\nAs well so another another tough week for your investments if ... if you're invested you felt this week to you've got all the all these other unsettling headlines you've got bombs in the mail all over the country [noise]\nMassive moves in the Dow Jones you hear the headlines worst month for stock since two thousand nine correction territory now for the NASDAQ the S P hit a down ten percent intra day at one point to a correction territory for these major averages eight and a half trillion dollars lost in September\nAll in a week and this is where it gets ... I'm not going to say it gets confusing but these are the cross currents of being an investor at all in a week or a third quarter GDP\nJust got report it so we're just now in the fourth quarter but what happened only a couple of weeks ago how much is the U.S economy growing well reported is three and a half percent growth rate which is a massive growth rate for twenty trillion dollar economy\nThat's a phenomenally strong number for an economy our size\n... if I go back and I look at it we just always trying to figure out\nDo we go into a recession do we go next session last week we talked about the twelve some cycles to try to get a little granular to really see hey or are we about to tip over into recession because we know when we go into recession that's really bad for socks and we stay out of recession these corrections just steak garden variety corrections uncomfortable\nBut still kind of garden variety one of my favorite parts of the week a piece of research up through looking at the U.S real fed funds rate\nAnd this is not a complicated topic here recessions and explain what real is versus nominal but recessions don't start with zero percent real interest rates [noise]\nWhat is what what is real well real in terms of an interest rate than not it's a you take the nominal rate of the fat so let's say the the ball here the real numbers you take the nominal rate from the fed what the fed is pegged to federal funds rate at and then you subtract whatever inflation is that's the end you get the real inflation\nThe thick of it this way if the fed is at around let's call it ... percent inflation is two percent\nThat means that real interest rates are effectively zero so you're getting charged if you're getting charged two percent on assets eh let's say you get a loan and just inflation itself is growing it to them technically\nThe real rate is zero the ... the good news with this statistic here in this research is that recessions really only started this goes all the way back to kind of post World war two we ... we do not get a recession and less real interest rates are at least at least in the three percent rage\nWe're we're nowhere near that so it really at least three percent typically four percent or higher so it's zero today federal funds is two two and a quarter inflation is around two two and a quarter that means that the real rate is zero suicides zero\nHistorically we are no where even close to recessionary levels\n... yet another important reminder again you've got the stock market over here we got the ... we've got the economy over here we've just got to make sure that the economy itself isn't completely rolling over in no more no better time to do that a than right now as we go through the stock market side that's gotten so difficult\nBecause you you and I again we both know that we the economy and stocks or the ... the academic environment and the stock environment they don't always hold ... they don't always hold hands\nThey do move in lockstep there plenty periods of time there's plenty of examples where we've got a good economy bad stock market good stock market bad economy you name it\nThere are plenty of down markets and that's what we're experiencing today is that we have a down stock market really rough market\nBut arguably extraordinarily strong economy\nAnd those two again they don't always line up there's a lot of really ah important examples about this go back to just twenty Fifteen ah we had no recession we just lived through that a couple of years ago we know we didn't go to a recession wasn't it wasn't a super robust growth economy but\nNot no no recession at all stock market dropped Fifteen Percent twice I've seen\nHow 'bout twenty eleven again no recession and twenty eleven headlines kinda got scary United States' debt got downgraded by us and Peter a couple of pretty scary a global headlines happening stock market down Twenty one percent\nTwenty one percent not just a correction that's technically a bear market just in twenty eleven again no recession economy state okay\nA ... and again there's tons of examples you go back to Nineteen Seventy six no recession stock market minus Nineteen percent\nSo they're all there are tons of there are lots of different examples of a stock market the gets nervous\nGets emotional and arguably there's a lot of emotion tied to this market to ... to mid term elections coming up and now what we could counting days versus just weeks and you're worried about how this election going to go what's happening with China are interest rates going up so it's kind of this long list of\nNo ... no particular ... ah issue I think is a dagger for the economy but he put on together all these bricks let's call them and the wall for a then you start to build up this wall of ... if things there there are a lot of things happening\nBut the bottom line here is as uncomfortable as the stock market corrections are and I know they're uncomfortable they're often and again you've heard this they're the best time to be buying in the best time to really be investing now hold hold the phone for a second because you're out there say West I'm already invested that doesn't help me fair again\nSo it may it may not be an opportunity than if you're already invested may not be an opportunity to double down and buy more of your already invested but it's certainly not a time to be selling\nCertainly not time to be running for the hills I always think of that ... for some reason always thinking a beach ball analogy where a ... I think of a falling market particularly in a good economy where we are today as pushing a beach fall\nDown and down lower and lower beneath the water's surface then at some point to think about that that that exercise where you kind of get the ball in the water that search to get harder and harder as you push it lower so that's the market at some point\nThe pressure of the good economy will will push the ball back above the water it will it will it will it will the ball will rise back to where it should be\nA as as you get this greater and greater a disconnect between have that the stock market is doing poorly even though the economy is good and I think that's really where we are right now\nA win sell offs become attractive well\nWe are at approximately fifty percent are half of the companies in the SP five hundred are already in the market today down twenty percent that's a bear market remember remember corruption ten percent negative bear market twenty percent\nAnd it kind of makes sense we're right around that correction level for the SP five hundred well about half of stocks are down in actual bear market territory if you look back over the course of ... that's the level that typically starts marking a turning point right right around what's happening today and it doesn't happen in a day or even in the week\nBut you start to get enough carnage\nAnd so stocks go on sale ... and ... in in some to some extent here when you get half of all stocks in a in a bear market character you're talking about math this is a massive\nSale on a massive scale and that brings in droves of new buyers\nAnd the beach ball rises back up to the top\nThat's a that's we're probably getting closer and closer to that kind of tipping point now there's there's also this argument or this question to you still have in your head as well how much risk is too much\nAt the there's a nervous month for folks so are you are you may be questioning a little bit unbalanced than I'm supposed to do some in stocks some in bonds at someone reads but that didn't feel good enough just yet\nBecause investing is a mix between what you think he's going to happen and what you can tolerate that actually happens in these of the time this is a period of time when you kind of get tested\nWe're to talk that through also phone lines open for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty get for a for eight seven to zero seven fifty here in the studio money up state you more money matters straight at [noise]\nMaking ... the twenty four hour traffic Senate construction in Mariana Seventy five north down between del ... teams sixty one to the north who married a parkway and said to sixty five four\nRight lanes are blocked expect heavy delays right now how we forty one good alternate and the express lane appointed north for a north down as well eighty five north down before Pleasant Hill eggs at one oh four watch reconstruction they're roadwork in two left lanes\nAnd a kosher on Abernathy close between Glenn rich Georgia for hundreds take Mount Vernon or arousal road to avoid that Jackie lead up all the as the\nIt'd be they're all just grabbing it with the most accurate and dependable weather forecast after actually starting to warm up nicely with a lot of sunshine this afternoon temperatures will tap out around Seventy one degrees overnight\nAnd into Monday morning it'll be cool to get down towards the low fifty in town some upper forties outside the perimeter that Sunday in a high of Seventy tomorrow on Tuesday will stay sunny low forty eight Seventy three\nI'm David Baker the experts you here on my home fix the Joe or the ones you want keeping your heating and cooling system running right\nCalled cool right they get you faster and often the best warrant teasing guarantees I have seen in Atlanta they also help get rid of all those voices in your head Korean carrier turned to the experts\nTwenty four hour news weather and from\nFive AM seven fifty\nAsked me to\nNo good morning it's nine thirty\nAnd it will Lenski live in the ws beef twenty four hour news center with our top stories this half hour there is an FBI news conference ongoing right now in Pittsburgh and the names of the eleven people shot and killed while praying in their synagogue by that anti Semitic\nGunmen have been released Dr ...

money matters here on a Sunday Morning and we're going to go right back to this question and a and I think we actually had a ... if we've got a we've got to the\nCold dropped but we're gonna I'm gonna answer the question anyway so if you're just tuning back in or you are listening or the podcast the question really was hair I'm thinking about putting money in up\nTo this is ... that's a Seventy years old thinking about putting two hundred thousand dollars into an annuity in immediate annuities it gives a payout that's around two thousand dollars a month\nAnd at the caller's question was hey do I do I'm I'm thinking about doing it thirty percent of of my money and I think about this there's all these other things to consider well we know that their Social Security and there's a pension involved here and this would be another stream of income and then that'd be number ...\nThe media to New Orleans is a third stream of income and then the fourth stream of income would be regular investment income from other investments so\nThis is kind of an interesting as as interest rates have started to go out where we went we went for the better part of a decade with the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates pretty much a zero and and all the interest rates are low ... if you if you you know what I'm Talking about if you have your mortgage rates probably three and a half percent if you got a mortgage\nA couple of years ago I've seen people in the two and a half percent range two and a quarter percent range mean interest rates have been ultra low\nSo barring costs of below but it's so that's a good ... good thing on the other side of the wage and\nBond rates treasury rates have been extraordinarily row were extraordinarily low which has been not so good\nIt's also impact and things like immediate annuities payouts because what does an annuity company do when you turn over a hundred or two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars to have you think they invested in the ass and be five hundred of the NASDAQ no\nThey buy bonds and the better interest rates are on bonds that are these paths are going to be\nAnd if you go through and I just did a couple of calculations on ... and immediate annuity or a website that will show you give you some ballparks of what different carriers are offering that's about right if you put your age Seventy and you want to start in income stream today\nYou can get about Eighteen Nineteen hundred bucks a month\nThe group so that sounds pretty good because that's a that's approximately an eight percent ... you'd look at it isn't\nEight percent rate of return right twenty four thousand abide by three hundred and eight percent a year\nWell that's great but what if you die and you're five now if you die and you're five you've gotten five payments of twenty four thousand dollars a year you've gotten a hundred and twenty grand back\nSo you have now just given the annuity company you've left on the table hundred and eighty thousand dollars and that's a that's obviously the downside of these immediate annuities you've got to turn over the money to the new company\nFor the promise of getting paid forever so you've got to live a really long time in order to get at least just to get your money back\nAnd that I think is the tough part about doing one of the news you've gotta so so we've got to live twelve Thirteen Years just to get your money back let alone what interests you could have gotten during that twelve year period of time and today by a ten year treasury bond now for well over three percent a
