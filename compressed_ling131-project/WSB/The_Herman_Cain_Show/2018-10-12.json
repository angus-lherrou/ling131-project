the next time there's a Democrat president we've broken through this\nAnd uh hey it's not ... it's not anything that a drunken picnics and didn't say in the oval office that's for sure so thoroughly [laughter] there were no cameras that were just tapes a but it's a it's a it's a strange time you know the fact that you have a president who\nDidn't even know a lot of artists will go after\nTanya and say that he's a upon or a token but artists are the things that offends artist as when anybody ask them what they are going to say and ... and says they have to approve\nBefore you speak obviously nobody asked me what he was going to say\nAnd they just opened up the cameras and allow that to happen when I say is a I mean I didn't vote for Trump I didn't vote for Clinton you can uh love Trump or you can hate Trump but there has never been a White House\nThis transparent vests open I mean you never wonder what does that guy really thinking you know\nWhat's really going on there so that's one
