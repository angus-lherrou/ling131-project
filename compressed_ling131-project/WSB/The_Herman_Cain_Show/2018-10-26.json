facilities\n[noise]\nHere that only failed but super fail right on both counts Erich von has or [laughter]\n[noise]\nI\nCalled it that's rights are and the reason I called it and the reason I knew it was because Megan Kelly has almost no talent when it comes to being a person I was television about when you hear a promo like this I mean how could you not want to go back to let's go back to the old days before she failed and there is a rich Megan Kelly a year ago\nThat is incredibly divided right now\nIs that they show it can be a unifying force one that encourage\nMake people feel like in the air the end of it\nYou can tune in for an hour and ...\nYeah well the fist cater there whereas a wow medical oh why oh backing Kelly you're with us yes\nYou know I\nJust really hope that my show could be a place where\nDress up like Mr T. if they want it to even if they were white\nFeel empowered and\nIn the belly full of candy corn and I just want people to go out there and\nMaybe send me a check

world\nWe're going to face it together and with each of you getting me just ten dollars\nTo walk away with a hundred and eighty bucks\nAt least at least\nNow here's the thing that they get to is more uh I don't want to I have\nEvery once in a chair and get your checkbook [laughter]\nYou know what the everybody's my name is now really weird it's any gee why and [laughter]\nShe has to go find me a ... [laughter]\nSo uh uh there's a lot of levels here an eye when George George says I Want to get to 'cause you're not going to need that ten dollars baggage because\nHere's the deal this is the way that I look at this or that blackface thing is not the reason she's losing his job it's it's the best excuse the people upstairs that'd be see could not believe they've been added this gift\nIt's twenty Eighteen because this show wasn't working and also I have to say also that she you have to remember on a show that was failing decided to go all the way to the wall in her Matt Lauer sexual harassment coverage\nIt hurt today slot and so they didn't like or or the ratings were terrible they signed her for sixty two million dollars\nNow wait let me break in here really quickly skew everyone everyone on my show love the show\nYes I Do believe that people were watching I think everyone was watching my daughter hated it [laughter]\nIf he's on a job yeah your daughter is on the today show she hated it\nGeneral with text me every day man making his donors rocks [laughter]\n\nIt was never a good deal was not a good citing that'd be seated this thing and this happens in media lot happens in radio\nA lot uh off the heels of her you know Donald Trump stuff at the first debate where she brought up his opposing massage any and then he said she was bleeding from all over everywhere and that whole thing there's people in media just go oh look\nShe's in the News Let's give her sixty two million dollars and bring her over here but the fact of the matter was she was never going to work at NBC she she's not officially fired yet\nNot officially and she had she had more ... she made more money than a sixty nine\nMillion dollar you know some sort of sexual thing\n[laughter]\nI don't I don't know what President Trump works for the sixty\nDollars no you what are your drop it didn't work out with Megan Kelly\nLike I tried to help her when she doesn't wanna when she took the easy way out to the big they get she could have been nicer to drop back when I was reading and maybe she'd be ... is right\nNow [laughter]\nLord I Would rather look at making Kelly the lower Arab ally glory or that any good at\nSo [laughter]\nLaura in group is still has a show and that can kill a dozen well we'll talk to Georgia about later I my understanding is she requested that Ronan Farrow being her meeting with NBC today because I think she's going to try to throw in some sort of\nThere's some truth there I think that the that her coverage of the sexual harassment NBC's stuff is really the reason but she's being fired along with the fact that nobody was watching the show but we'll get to that little bit later another headlines\nOr Georgia Democrat officials claim that more than four thousand seven hundred applications to vote by mail are missing in DeKalb County chairs\nDo but if if the case of a ... there's two different sides you got the New York times saying you this is true yeah and you also have a stamp film that who's the chairman of the cab county saying that's not true at all\nWell who do you believe I this is what I Believe I get so confused by all the because this is a different story than the one with the judge correct saying that you have to count every but you can't remove people from the rolls because their signatures though match and\nIt's just the Democrats issue they're going to keep you they're gonna keep pounding this until they until they get their way\nYeah but the only problem is this is my experience in the United states of America it ain't that difficult to votes it's not that difficult to vote if I've got to go pick you up hold your hand to help you if there's a whole process teach you what you need to do\nWe're better off if you don't vote that's what I think\n[laughter]\nYou know what I Would take ten minutes of my life and learn how to vote it's not that difficult where did you got to go what are you going to do\nAnd are now the the part with the judge\nNow I hear the ... campaign is going to appeal that yes I'm not exactly sure that I understand why um if they just moved him into provisional ballots and then count them later it might be the easiest thing in the world because if you have\nIf point five percent of the ballots cast were professional and the winner wins by ... percent you don't matter it's just a matter of ... record keeping to go back go back and count that stuff you may not even need them so I the thing with the with the judge saying that they couldn't\nDo what they wanted to do on scrubbing people from the rolls I don't mind that part so much this forty seven hundred\nHow were they lost how are they supposedly last but didn't get the people who are obese absentee ballots all day I'm not quite understanding\nWhy I think the New York times is honing in on the fact that DeKalb County has voted blue for several years and if the forty seven hundred voters could sway that county so that's why that's why the New York times is honing in on it now the Georgia\nAtlanta is going on it and I am just become a national election I Know you've been raised here in Georgia\nNo the reason is because there's the whole narrative being started nationally that you know Georgia's a southern state full of groups and they're all racist and of course we know with Georgia or try to do it's really kind of like it's reverse prejudice\nOr the ... on the national scale on the local scale this forty seven hundred of these things by them back to work out at all of that absolutely but the narrative is going on nationally about the state of Georgia is is is a different kind of prejudice but most people don't live in Georgia in this country most people don't live in the south\nSo it's very easy to ... to tell a story about the south but I'll tell you is look there's racism unfortunately there's racism in this world and there's\nLess of it now than there used to be but they're still racism in the world but I'm a I was born a Yankee sorry they'll come after me I was I was born a Yankee and I can tell you in my experience there's less racism in the state of Georgia then the state of New York
