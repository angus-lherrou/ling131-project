Patel has never really really gotten my humor that's been a little bit of a so she answers sarcasm and quite often just like Jared did proves that they don't even understand the premise of the joke and so what I Do at home is what I just did I say Jane or let's do this\nNext story had on that yeah you're right I go let\nPeople asked how what's the secret to watch that you've been married for Thirty years what is the secret of staying together and you know my answer is\nWhat's your answer and I just stay together [laughter] true easier it'll stay together than it is to break up the things that would have broken other people up my wife and I are just like me just keep on going right yeah yeah\nYou'd have to decide if that\nReally worth arguing over or making a big deal [noise] let me just wait a day and see if it's still bothers me now okay let's move\nOn let me tell you this I I the things that the what my wife is great about there are things that would make me demand divorce\nFor instance a few years ago I don't know this is still going on but a few years ago it was all the rage for the wives to give the husband's a honey do list\nIf my wife ever presented me with a honey do list I Would present her with divorce papers immediately and why why because uh your wife\nShould be your best friend your spouse should be your best friend friends don't give friends homework had a friend who gave your homework that person is not your friend much longer so the whole concept\nOf the honey do list when my wife doesn't do that kind of stuff she lets me live my life she just quite often doesn't understand what the hell I'm Talking about but she's not alone on that give me some headlines have turkey\nIt says that that were Thirteen minutes and [laughter]\nAt target stores as a Washington Post journalist Jamal your show is killing only took seven minutes guys\nOnly I think you really minimizing something just really horrible only took seven minutes yeah what happened like you don't want well no it was not for him no was it wasn't quick at all seven minutes is an attorney to be murdered over a quick death is you turn around and you barely registered bus and you're got\nSeven minutes this is I don't know how this is how dumb the Saudi Arabians are because they're doing with putting does\nUh they're doing what a drunk in China does yeah but but they're just a lot dumber potent when he kills\nReporters that are his rivals he's smart enough to keep some kind of shadow of a doubt of what happened even though everybody goes oh come on and there's been five people you've been murdered in the last two years there's but there's always a shadow of the doubt\nThese salaries like oh we'll be like that\nYou kill this guy\nIn in your own consulate there is no shadow of a doubt also what they must not have been thinking about and this is the only way I can figure out why turkey apparently as audio maybe video\nIs because embassies and consulates all over the world are always bothered by the host country right this was something everybody knows\nAnd and they're also bought by their own country so when visitors walk in you walk into the Chinese embassy they want to know what's being talked about and get a record of it so\nIdiocy on both ends first of all if you murder somebody inside your own constantly if they walk in and they don't walk out\nSo there is no wiggle room\nAnd then apparently there's some sort of ... record of this audio or video or both and a few outlets who've seen it in the few ... this is what happened according to this report\nSo this guy wants to get married by the way remember this is not an American citizen but a permanent resident of the United states an ally of Saudi Arabia so this guy walks into the consulate\nAnd apparently just almost immediately service Fifteen people would ever flew in just kill team\nFlew in from Saudi Arabia they learn to him in if you want to get married to the Turkish girl is going to computers paperwork done he walks and as soon as she walks and basically they take 'em they take them over to the the uh building next to it where the uh the guy who I don't know who's the guy in charge the ambassador whatever what\nIt'll be his residence so they go over there and they from them down on a table and they just start cutting him up while he's alive\nHe starts making so much noise that the forensics expert who was running this thing\nFinally drawn to him so he would shut up\nAnd then they can they they finished this member and also the the head the guy in charge was you guys need to do the somewhere else you're going to get me in trouble also when the the forensics guy who was this memory of him\nHe was he had headphones on he was listening to music he tells the other guys according to this audiotape apparently tells the other guys hey I listen to music while I Do is I'd suggest you do the same thing\nI mean this is something out of a John move film so they just came out of Saudi Arabia kill team yeah kill team fit to planes learned here man you can't get married if you don't come in to get his paperwork done immediately he walks in their thrown down on the table and the other room and the other building and they just start saw on them or\nDo we know why they specifically targeted him because he he is a reporter goes back to the nineties has long\nBeen a reporter known in Saudi Arabia for a long time he used to be very close to the royal family and he started at some point reporting on the uh the activist uh I hate to use the term resistance used to have a meaning before what it means now but in Saudi Arabia I think of the resistance\nAnd so he started reporting on that stuff that's why finally it's why he's lives in America and now is uh doing his reporting for or was doing was reporting for Washington Post now here's the thing we're probably there's probably a lot more information about this person and their relationship to the royal family that we don't know\nYou know he apparently it was on the side of the Muslim Brotherhood they're not on the side of the Muslim Brotherhood was he's still on the side of the Muslim Brotherhood at this point in his life I don't know\nThere's probably a lot more it may be that Saudi Arabia at this point saw him more as a spy or some kind rather than a reporter and I don't know over time that stuff will be found out and and and that debris will be ... we'd gone through and we'll find out exactly what the relationship was\nBut he was a permanent resident of the United states an ally of Saudi Arabia and they did this and they did it in such a stupid white but here's the thing there's only one way they can get out of this\nBut I Do but we still need Saudi Arabia whether we like it or not with all this stuff going on with Iran the fact that we're about to ... put the final nail in the coffin with them with the oil stuff in a couple of weeks we need Saudi Arabia that's all there is to it the only way out for them they ... they got to get off of this it was rogue elements wasn't rogue elements\nWhat they need to do is cop to it and then contrition and the only way of contrition is\nWe need to see like\nOver a hundred political dissidents prisoners being let out\nThey need to go on record and say they're not going to kill this twenty four year old girl that we're going to be had for being an activist they need to let other of these uh you know these comedians are in jail in Saudi Arabia\nThe only way to get the way out of this is massive

Presley says\nI just want to know that those bombings or just for um the ... of course no one's using the word me then ah right let's do some\nHeadlines a President Trump will ask each a member of his cabinet or to cut five percent of their respective budgets\nYou have your audio him doing a little bit of a surprise\nWas one of those um public cabinet meetings\nThat I don't even remember really anybody else doing that I like how he does those yeah I mean is it I don't think anybody I'll just do usually what happens is when you have those big cabinet meetings where everybody is the big table they let the press in for three or four or five minutes they get pictures they yelled get as they answer the questions that aren't answered and they get out\nI don't remember any other president that would just hold meetings in front of the press\nI end the most transparent Andrew in history I'm so chance that I mean there's a book\nBy the way by the way it thinking about this this is off that topic but uh he is so transparent when he talks about\nThe uh the Saudi reporter that was a permanent American resident but from Saudi Arabia reporter that was killed in a in the consulate you talk about transparency he's just saying things that every other president will be dealing with that wouldn't say like oh I don't know they got to give us a lot of money for a place\nLike their legs let way down and I every other\nPresident behind the cw have egos conversations but they would never say it in front of people because they would think it would seem well you know it's a man's\nLife in the winter that Afghan [laughter]\nYou have to know that by now\nIt should be a rather obvious that that's not the big thing right now so he has these meetings in public and I think he likes to surprise his own cabinet members and I think this was a surprise to them when he said this\nI'm going to ask each of you to come back with a five percent budget cuts from fuel various apartments whether it's a secretary of the ministry and\nBut uh [laughter] and that by the way is a great idea let me just say this this is what's gonna happen my name's Eric on tests are I'm fifty four years of age I've seen this a million times\nOn a CNN and the MSNBC is in the world you always hear it was just always just sort of lament where are the fresh ideas where the new ideas this is\nMaybe not fresh has been around for a while but we'll be new if implemented and the CNN to the world this is where the heck need reporting lazy reporting it so lazy I'm going to tell you what happens in over the next month or so you can watch it happen now that\nMeans in ... if I can predict what they're going to do and they just do it right it's going to be lazy rather than being a reporter and saying well this is new this is different all the effects would be one of the actually worked what's gonna happen is\nEvery grievance group on the left is going to come out with a sort of a PR statements about what is so bad and what's going to be lost from ... in that department because we're cutting back\nFive percent and the lazy reporters are going to rip and read that you're going to be bombarded\nWith nothing but reports about how many children are going to starve because such and such department is cutting five percent when common sense tells you five percent of any budget can be cut any budget having to do with anything five percent of it is waste\nCommon sense tells you that but\nReporting I mean it's like when he asked that question when he when he put that directive out there it's like in a horse race where the gates open\nI Know where these were reporting horses are going they're going right to their computers right to their emails that they get their emails from such and such group or the group and favorite feed the hungry in the ... to ...\nNine thousand different groups that are that are in favor of the so called little people and this is how reporting is going to be for the next month story after story after story about who gets hurt\nIf we cut five percent of the budget from every cabinet\nBut common sense tells you that five percent of your damn household budget\nCould be cut you might have to quit smoking boats or what but it could be caught\nThat's this is an example please mark this down I Want this to be an example if we can agree that it must be lazy reporting if I tell you exactly what's going to happen in the next month and then it happens\nThere are very few to ... know reporters\nAfter that story thinking themselves that's interesting that will be different I better start doing some reporting on what the real world effects of that will it work how much money could be said you will not see stories like that maybe on Fox but who cares that's just preaching to the choir\nAll the stories will be what different interest groups tell reporters will be the downside of losing five percent from this one that won in that one that's what's gonna happen because there is no real rapper Taj left in this country\nDo you think anybody will buy his uh any plan that he talked about in that same law he says he wants to fight a penny plan right the\nPoint is penny and we're here for a dollar for nearly every year after four or five years the countries in good shape\nOf saying listen to the ... the five but if\nHe didn't really put that pretty well [laughter] it's a good idea and it was not explained pretty well there could have said Nicole can step in and I step in here basically what's being said there is there's been an idea out there for a long time that makes sense if you take a penny out of every government dollars spent\nFor the fiscal year so for every one dollar you're supposed to spend you actually spend Ninety nine cents it turns out that it only takes a couple of years\nTo shrink the budget deficit and a lot of others and you save a lot of money so what he's saying is we take it a long time so let's do five cents rather than one penny so that's really a plan that you think for yourself before you get this onslaught of all the children that are going to die because of this\nThat's the concept for him for every one dollar every single dollar the government plans to spend they spend Ninety five cents instead\nIt's amazing the amount of money that but there's not a reporter at CNN or MSNBC that's going to even look at it they'll do it at Fox but like I said they'll be preaching to the choir and it won't matter\nBut for me it's more important for me to be writing for you to notice also just I\nTold you what the reporters are going to do now just watch it happen mobile H. L. and say\nI don't know the times on depends of looking at a news program and what about age ... than a is that though is that the shopping oh wow well I get on my political pundits pretty from a
