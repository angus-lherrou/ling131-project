joining us live today here on WWE and be very exciting\nTimes we're living in for sure not least of which is one of the nation is on fire it seems uh so is the city of Atlanta [noise]\nWe have something called the Gulch that his hanging over the residents and the entire state essentially because that's the city of Atlanta goes so does the state of Georgia with regard to crime taxes\nUh jobs transportation all of that all of which is going to be affected by this law by a thing called the Gulf so [noise] I\nEnded up going to a red light the Gulch meeting this past week in east Atlanta and it was extremely informative and I'm not going to get lost in the weeds of all of this because I have other people who are going to explain\nWhat the big uh who bought is over this but basically uh the public would pay nearly half of the five billion dollar investment investment which is really call this game called the red ... called the Gulch and get zero ownership\nThat's kind of like leasing a car right you have no ownership and that if I paying rent and your apartment only we're\nOnly the public would lose two point five billion dollars in taxes but that would only get one point eight percent of that and return as benefits now does that\nSound like you know you don't have to be like a an investor\nTo really see that that return is slightly skewed okay this means the public costs of the Gulf plan at about fifty five times as much as the public benefit fifty five times the car\nVersus public benefits okay I think I'm pretty sure you're a lemonade stand sixth grader can figure this out a this would be a huge loss\nTo what schools and infrastructure\nBut don't take my word for it I ran into someone who is very familiar with land grabs in the city of Atlanta former board member of investor Atlanta Julian ...\nLoose as I said the castle is the worst deal I've ever seen in my career and I'll just city of Atlanta deals but corporate [noise] um and the reason is that the cost to the public of this\nAre enormous and the benefits are tiny the disproportionate just shocked\nAnd so how is it though that we've gotten this far with this deal without pushed back until now [noise]\nWell I think you're seeing more pushback from the city council than probably we've ever seen before so I wouldn't be too unhappy about that um I think you'd have to ask the mayor and the administration why they're in the tank for this deal\nIs it that makes it so bad I mean we're talking about two billion dollars worth of taxpayer burden really and how does that break down\nYeah well actually I think is two and a half billion dollars in twenty Eighteen prices it's um about two billion dollars all property taxes\nI'm at when it is in full swing this project when it gets to five billion dollars in value the taxes every year will be Ninety million dollars that otherwise would have been guessing\nBecause those same offices and hotels will be built somewhere else in the city if

ignored and according to the charter it also has grounds for removal from office\nAlso according to Georgia State law professor Tanya Washington who was present at red light the Gulch she started talking about the murdering of recalling seats and you've got a notice this go steal can be the grounds for a recall\nAnd so here we are this is where we are right now it's in the city council's hands
