don't cut your finger on the sharp shards of metal in that area and there you go\nAll right that's one of the problem with that is it takes about three minutes and uh you know that doesn't include the time to get your filters so take your time wrinkle your eyebrows a couple of times pretend to measure something kind of fill out the time stretches out a little bit\nBut that's the ... and the

critters more off you know\nIt's the temperatures not cold enough to kill the bugs is do you bugs die when it gets really cold out when it freezes let the into some bugs that we have to worry about\nAbsolutely once you get to frost and you hit the nail on the head as\nWe were at Ninety degree temperatures are back in early October two weeks ago yeah in stink bugs were trying to come inside at Ninety degrees but they're so smart once we get past I'm Scott plates from equinox I Know it's a real term but I had to look it up but when the days start getting shorter\nThese bugs understand that and they start coming inside even though we were at Ninety degrees which is like summertime here the bugs are smart enough to know what's coming next\nAnd they need to survive winter because you're right Dave\nIs yet or you go down the bug list mosquitoes yellow jackets stink bugs lady bugs they're gonna die once we get the frost now obviously some of them survive because they get into our homes or they find a warm place but yes um bugs will either die off and win or go into what a state called die a pause which is basically hitting the pause button on your TV\nThis is why when you see a bean now or a fly now you can pretty much walk up to put your hand out pension to death and it won't fly away because it's just like they're so slow I mean\nFlies this time if you kept it on a fly it's like you just walk up with your fingers and kicking your flick it and then we'll just Luke Luke you\nSo many of our dogs eat what green outside and then once we get the cold temperatures with the leaves fall in that less of a food store so if you have less of a food source they have less energy in in again you're you're on the money this morning Dave 'cause you're right there was more lethargic they're low in their bodies down and that's right\nSo that means the critters are out and about a bunch of squirrels in the yard and you say every month every month as breeding months if you're a squirrel or read or write corals have breeding see oh do they oh\nThey have they have to so you have December or January and then you have another one in June for gray squirrels flying
