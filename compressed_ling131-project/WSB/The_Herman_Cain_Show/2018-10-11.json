going to have a son was through the Internet if they're going to or maybe even England right you've got to play hardball with Wall Street like a lot of these guys they jumped out\nNo more free refill [laughter] Vegas pay gonna make them I think that this might actually shake out to be a good thing the fed has to raise rates in case we have another\nBust so they have something that they can do which brings bring rates back down yet that's the only ammunition they have so they have to replenish their MO [noise] let's face it\nIt's not easy finding a truly honest company a company that takes great pride in their workman ship accompany you can really trust so I have an exceptional experience I Want a shared Erich von ... here to let you know how impressed I Am with Findlay roofing you know

they had found yes what they let me know my roof is holding up just fine with no problems that gives me peace of mind and it also drives home the fact that Finley roofing is never going to try to sell you something that you don't need that's\nExcellent that's honesty that's pride and workman's ship I trust these guys and so can you stop procrastinating get your peace of mind take care of any minor issues you might have before water gets into your home schedule your free roof analysis\nFrom simply roofing at roof rooms dot com\nBubble you asked me about ... er Cox media group station [noise] twenty four hour news weather and\nFive and am sent\nMe a lot to me\nNow and the clock morning I'm Sabrina cupid live in the ws he's twenty four hour news that are Michael is now a tropical storm but he's left the path of death and destruction and Florida and here in Georgia an eleven year old girls killed in Seminole county in southwest Georgia\nWhen a carport hit her now the tree is was earlier reported the wind picked up that carport dropped it on her house punctured the roof and then heading her in the head against the eleven year old girl is dead\nThis morning President Trump has now declared a state of emergency here in Georgia\nAnd he is expected to visit the state next week to survey damage from the storm we are expecting to hear from governor Nathan Deal later this hour he will update the situation in our state at ten thirty will try to bring the governor to you live and we're now getting a look at the damage from this historic storm\nSea ranges thing happened in my neighborhood you know suffering she's reading thing\nI'm looking outside right and I'm a I'm On the city blocks so I end the block next to me for the five blocks down some but on the third floor yeah I could see it for five blocks down out of power and that block\nBut not you but not me not on the other side of that blow your\nBreath what you're doing is you're bragging a little here saying you're one of the beautiful people and you were able to look down from your terrorists at ah the little people whose power went out when you or did he used\nTo have that across the street when I was on thirteenth street midtown yeah on our side of the street we our power to be out but then the tower in front of us would have power\nAnd you knew then you were the little people\nYeah but they would look down on our courtyard enough hanging out yeah sun and getting drunk and they wished\nThey oh I'll bet you all those really rich people who had power and air conditioning and all that kind of\nI mean when there was no power generally during the\nDay okay but then as revealed when it comes time to find out who's going to lose the power first and we find out who actually has genuine our ... who's having more fun without power well that's called rationalize that we would all congregate in court yard and you would ever tell you what I heard relaxing from my family when I was a kid\nI was here there's a lot you remind me of this right now with your rationalizing my ah family to say oh yeah they're rich people over there but who wants to be rich [laughter] they didn't want to you know I realize as I grew up but they didn't want to ... it's really kind of a psychological thing they didn't want to put themselves on the line\nAt one fell those troubles are being read just having a good food and you know having to\nWorry about whether or not you're paid the phone bill one that I realized as I grew up there it was a ... you know when I was ten I was very silent like you want them\nWell sure me I'd like to be rich\nBut I realized that later on if they were just afraid to put themselves out there I think so if you say I would never want it in a million years you don't have to strive for it you don't have to worry about failing on your way trying to attain that sort of psychological deal it goes on there so you reminded me of a painful moment from my childhood\nI Want to say on the record but that's not what I meant I Would love the money oh yeah but you ought to be rich but we were having a lot of fun over in our little Korea [laughter]\nShe's rationalizing give me another story a President Trump and the Republican Party again seized on the left wing angry inward mantra to keep their mid term base fired up in Pennsylvania last night\nYeah so the Trump he didn't do many funny things in the do much that was funny\nHe had a couple of ... I think he is normal stand up you know I I think he knew him not just you I mean yeah like a cheap I'm\nYou are down yeah I'm telling you that matches to an arsonist and you don't have power to a left wing mob you know what else he's doing this is why CNN's afraid this is why the Democrats are afraid because the next breath what he's doing is he's a conjuring up imagery of Venezuela\nAnd this is you can see now are a little bit for the midterms but where he's going to go and twenty twenty if the economy still humming along and things are going well he's going to say OK these crazy people that you see in the streets there socialist\nVenezuela's socialist and you see a lot of people a lot of angry people on the streets and his and I think this is what worries the CNN's or the world is it looks like it might be a winner\nLooks like it might be a winner the idea that uh well do you what do you want but we have\nThe one we have or do you want to go down the socialism Bernie Sanders wrote you could take a look at Venezuela if you want to see how that ends up and whenever a the Democrats uh CNN whenever they feel threatened they have to tell you how an educated you are oh no you don't know what the word mob means\nAnd also you didn't know it's very important to only use that word in the correct way so once you see the other side educating people on something that is because they're afraid and I mix\nYou feel a a sad to lump CNN in Washington Post and these other outlets in with the Democrat Party but um two plus two equals four and Ronald Reagan said don't be afraid to see what you see the other side of don't be afraid to see what you see is don't ... don't be afraid to speak of what you see\nSo there's a part of me that never wants to be taken as just another person on TALK radio so I Try to avoid terms like mainstream media and things like that but\nI'm not going to avoid things to the point of being ignorant\nYou do have to ask yourself the question why are the ... why are the concerns of the anchors on CNN this week using the term mob properly or improperly why don't why are those concerns exactly the same concerns that the Democrat Party has this week\nI mean I Can't I Can't bend over backwards or put myself into a pretzel logic to not point out\nWhat is obvious and I don't celebrate it I don't celebrate it I think CNN needs to look at this and think okay what are we are we going to be the left of center answer to Fox News perfectly legitimate\nIf you're getting your butt handed to you by MSNBC\nPerfectly legitimate to make that choice but if you make that choice own it don't try to sell Don Lemon as\nA neutral anchor of an evening show because Fox News you can take them all on them all you want they don't sell Sean Hannity to me\nAs a neutral anchor of a new show he's an advocate they say it he says it MSNBC does not try to sell Rachel mad out to me as a neutral non committed nonpartisan host\nCNN tries to get the best of both worlds and that's why they fail everywhere that's on them also the weird thing about CNN is for an outlet that loses as much as they do they're really arrogant [laughter]\nOh how can they be so arrogant when they're constantly losing I mean look at the show it wins wins wins wins from day one and I'm Still humble [laughter]\nRight that's right right yeah yeah and I buy my ego steal a check Oh yes sir so he had some Oh thank you thank you for saying that again and taught you know Trump did have some\nFun moments last August he relived or what it was like being on the campaign trail and twenty sixteen\nThey're coming from the ... the valley [noise] people that ... for a long time and time into a maverick\nEr those you know the ... and early in the mood to him at some of them are going back on Monday and making\nIt coming from the ... people that have it for a long time because they didn't want to vote for the people that were running for office and\nCenters Israel from Santa Cruz [noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\nThat [laughter]\nThe last to me there [laughter]\nLike he was Vietnamese food that we're losing your job statues jumped so [laughter]\nI Love it to the part\nThis is gonna be the latest thing if they have time they've already stopped down for the N. word controversies\nBut uh you mentioned the me too movement yes he did by the way this will not be the last time because remember according to the rules of the of the Washington Post and CNN\nThe moment he referred to Elizabeth Warren is Pocahontas he was done but in reality he doubled down kept saying so by the rules of CNN in Washington Post to even\nVenture to have any sort of humor is anything\nAround me too is a political\nPill that will kill you but my guess is he's going to double down and this was going to be the Pocahontas of the midterms and going into twenty twenty\nFive I usually expression you know the expression but [noise] under the rules of lead to I'm not allowed to use that expression\nIs

was it was the first got away pretty good right\nAs long as like the girls got away with [noise] my favorite moment was from what was this from [noise] I'd rather\nNot say the answer is yes as a reporter asked me to you talked to Saudi Arabia about the journal that's uh that's that's a story that's a hell of an interesting story will do that and we\nBegin every day and my mom told us being
