now are bleeding over into\nSpecially acts of violence I mean this is what's driving me crazy in the last twenty four hours or so why does everybody have to have a ... have to speculate as to who's behind this why they did it\nJohn Brennan former director of the CIA is talking about extreme rhetoric right and the two months extreme rhetoric will lead to this kind of violence isn't the same this is the same guy who a couple of months ago when on television and all over the place and told people as a former director of the CIA\nTold people that President Trump was a traitor\nThat his behavior was treasonous I Believe that was the during the ... and after that press conference\nSo a guy like John Brennan says oh this extreme harsh rhetoric\nBut doesn't look in the mirror\nAnd one world is it not extreme harsh rhetoric deport point to be current president United States and say that he's guilty of trees and that he's a trader so\nI don't care what I mean I'm Glad the John Brennan is fine I'm Glad none of these things went off but I don't care if he's going to get up their moral lives when he's a part of this the last twenty four hours it's been so obvious to me\nIf if this is indeed the result and we don't even know that yet if this is the result of our political rhetoric getting out of hand\nEverybody get off your high horse there's plenty of blame to go around\nSo I got to go to Fox News and and here the reasons why the liberals are to blame and then I go to CNN here the reasons why uh the the conservatives are to blame and I can back off and go hey you the kind of ... in a way you're both right\nPolitical rhetoric has not been heated up by one side\nPolitical rhetoric has gotten out of control on both sides that is true plenty of blame to go around again\nIs that is in fact what's happening here there is beauty in realizing that you don't always have to immediately have an opinion on something\nIs wrong with allowing people to investigate this this could be any ...\nThis could be not a million different things but this could be a few different things\nEverything from hopes on one end\nTo a new dangerous political movement\nThat we that's been flying under the radar on the other and everything in between is possible foreign actors ... well you could throw it either by the way I'm going to go to you the conspiracy desk ... every three different people this morning\nTim Andrews Jerry's yeah I'm I'm a widow and a person that I Will not a I don't talk about much I don't wanna bring them into three different people\nWalked in with strong views and opinions about what this is and there was one thing they had in common will to one is not ... none of them know in reality and the other is in some way shape or form they came to this through social media\nRather than saying I'm smart enough now in twenty Eighteen after having all this experience to definitely reject the first place social media goes on anything and what I went to ... well that's to me the same thing it's a it's it's social media\nYeah but when I look at the trends and I see the Thursday thoughts I mean that's where I get my sons from it was the first yeah\nWhere are they going to get the dog [laughter] not going to wake up with your own Thursday's\nAwful you know you have to get on the Internet somewhere else I just want to tell people it's it's okay to say I don't know who or what or why stands behind these actions and neither do you and you don't have to walk around acting as if you do\nThere is a million different things that I just said there aren't a million\nOf a few a few I've gone from a few to a million times there are ... there are several really I'm not [laughter] I Know\nThere are several things that could be going on here and if everybody listening to me already knows what happened why the hell are we paying the FBI and the other investigative teams to do their work if you are listening to me now already know what happened let's just call off the investigation\nBecause here's the thing you you you go on record with your friends family and everybody on social media this with you on what this is and then if the truth comes out and this isn't what you said it was well now you're stuck you've got to double down on what you already said it was whether it's real or not\nIt's okay to not know we can just say hey I'm Glad none of these went off nobody's been harmed yet\nAnd I believe the once if you send out that many bombs that are going to find you you send out one or two over a three month period and then stop maybe they don't find you the more of these things that gets sent out\n\nThere'll be found and ... and then we'll find out what's behind it could be not him why do I keep wanting to say a million different things I have to check my own hyperbole but at least at least I Do it I check my own hyperbole I refuse\nI refused to check my privilege but I Will check my own hyperbole I'm saying to people there's beauty there's there there there's there's a\nThere's peace in the space\nOf saying events happened they're investigating I Will wait to form an opinion\nAfter I see the results of the investigation account of the other side Eric oh is that what you have to say well you have ... or ... I I don't know if they had a letter Schumer and Pelosi\nImmediately politicize this basically after Trump said what he said uh you'd see a going after the media no no no one Trump said these are threats aren't attack on democracy and they actually\nOf political violence heart attack on our democracy itself and immediately\nSchumer and Pelosi I actually that he was repeating himself there earlier today said this from the White House and immediately Schumer and Pelosi put out a press release just says well this rings hollow coming from you or you see what they see where we are\nThis is not about dialogue so if the president didn't say anything about this they would have had a press release that said once again the president's shows that he does not understand the ... you know and if he does say something oh it rings hollow\nAnd and if and if you're a fan of the president and you're listening to it I just said and you're agreeing I can almost guarantee you you've done the same sort of thing\nThat people who disagree with you\nBecause we're not in a situation about dialogue or persuasion trying to convince each other if anything\nIt's we're in we're living in the days of doubled down America\nBefore you have all of the facts\nCome up with your opinion and published that opinion to let everyone know what your opinion is in lieu of facts that when the facts come out just doubled down on the first thing that you said because remember you're not interested in persuasion you're living in doubled down America\nYou're not interested in persuading anyone to your point of view it doesn't seem to me whether you're on the left or you're on the right so until we get facts\nAbout this I got to deal with every conspiracy theorists from the left and the right and the mental Jim Andrews comes in this morning like he's an expert\nLike he was a ... he's the munitions expert all of a sudden he does man the conspiracy news I Know that but he's I don't think he's a musician sex really well none of them had triggers for the whole thing was so tell me are all the things that social media taught you in the last twenty four hour\nWell my main problem with all this is why is Debbie Wasserman Schultz hate so many of our own party\n[laughter] All right I don't know if you say hey you know what it may be the obvious yeah is that they all seem to have come from Debbie why she right this is her event or for what I Want to do is uh in fact the one package I saw\nIt said from yeah that'd be who puts from on an ...
