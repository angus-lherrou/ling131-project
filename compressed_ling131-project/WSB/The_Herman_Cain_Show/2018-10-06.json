variety of reasons empty nesters you know young professionals millennials a job transfers often drive um a lot of activity so the fourth quarter and the Atlanta market is usually about twenty six to twenty eight percent of our annual sales volume\nThat's that's pretty good that's right if you split up into a hundred that's a quarter that's the worst does again these are not as the easiest mad like and do all day absolutely yup for all for eight seven zero seven fifty is number I have questions but more importantly you have questions so let's get your questions on the phone you ready\nSandy isn't Atlanta Sandy first call today on a Saturday hang on one second before you say anything Sandy I got to ask this is John is Sandy a man\nOr woman [noise] I'd say a woman All right Sandy when he got on this Quaker\nEnter designs one from one that's right [laughter]\nSo I have an elderly\nFamily member it has a house cramped completely to the bread with antiques and I was wondering is there any kind of a program that exists but he can sell the house now but still live in it for six to twelve months let's try to sort through all that stuff and get rid of the house\n[noise] um I Would say it would be tough to call it a program but certainly there may be could be an opportunity with certain investors who would be interested in maybe the property\nI'm and would do some form of her rent back where um you know the family can rent the home back from them for a period of time um so you can work through the antiques and you know making sure all the family heirlooms are handled appropriately\nUm but that's you know a situation where it would be you know more of you and your realtor working together to identify investors that could potentially be interested in the property is a rental property and negotiating Matt\nSo unfortunately I don't know of any particular company that would do um that type of a program but it's certainly possible it would just take a certain type of buyer\n[noise] ... it's called a rent back\nWell that's sort of an industry term but yeah so basically the the new home purchaser um purchases the home and then rent it back to the um\nUh you know previous owner and so it would be negotiated like any other release um you know in there would be tenet writes landlord writes all that\nUm so it's usually something I mean we've done it before certainly um anything over thirty days I'm usually becomes a lease versus more of a temporary occupancy is less than thirty days sometimes it can be negotiated where the seller stays for thirty days or less\nUm but maintains home insurance and maintains the utilities um and it does not create a landlord tenant relationship and so that has certainly advantages to the new homeowner because if say for example the\nAh previous owner does not leave at the end of that thirty days they don't have to go through an addiction process so anything beyond thirty days you're going to look at more of a really a leaf situation so\nAbsolutely possible but you know when you put your home on the open market it's hard to control who has an interest in who doesn't and so it could be where you're getting offers that or a compelling offers but maybe that homeowner isn't willing to do the rent back\nUm there are some programs out there and some companies that can help with the um you know sorting through all of the uh antiques in and you know personal property and help you move through that process a little more quickly so that may be a better option and in that way when the home goes on the market your opening it up to the widest possibility of buyers\nIs Sandy allowed to Wade through any offers she may get to look for somebody who's doing that or does she have to take them in order and if I make an offer and saying these house she's obliged to solve that house to me if I give her what she wants so\nWhen you're working with a realtor are often times were using um a a sort of a George association of realtors a contract\nAnd the only thing that could really come up as a full price offer came in with no contingencies and agreeing to everything that the seller wants in this transaction then a commission could be a vote even if the home doesn't sell\nBut the condition would be that this red back I'm as part of the agreement\nI'm so there is no obligation to sell just because you have your home on the market um you can reject over full price offers if for some reason there's something in it I'm clearly the only thing you would have to be thinking about are a fair housing laws and things like that you can't rejecting offer because of\nThose fair housing things like race you know I Am a religion et cetera\nUm but yeah there is no obligation to sell your home simply because you have it on the market are the only risk would be is if a perfect offer came in with no contingencies\nTheoretically a real estate agent could demand a commission I can speak for our company we would never do it just because of the bad publicity and press and you know ultimately our goal is to help the client with what they want and not just to earn a commission\nThank you so much thank you Sandy good luck and thank you bye yep like Sandy\nFor all for eight seven to zero seven fifty is the number I had a question right to set\nThe head and they just went right away and uh it's gone to the phones John in Hampton Jon your own home fix that show this morning\nYes sir my question is I've got a house it was built in the late eighties mhm and a master bath is\nShowing its age limit it to 'em\nIt's got like a fiberglass shower and stuff I Want to put the house on the market in this next spring and I'm just wondering July shovel a lot of money and remodeling this old master bathroom or or do I just left the ... the buyer choose what they want to do\nSo generally I Would recommend letting the buyer to choose what they want to do um is the rest of the home or in like ... for example if you upgraded the kitchen um since you've been on the home or is it also sort of been sat original condition\nWell it it\nThe original cabinets and counter tops but there are excellent shape a re did the the floors so I think I can leave them like they are\nSo what we would also want to look at it as the condition of been the the neighborhood or the homes nearby um if if it's common for homes in your neighborhood to be a an original condition then I Would not recommend putting a lot of money into a master bathroom upgrade\nUm you know generally what can happen is you're going to have certain taste that maybe the buyers don't have taste on so if the home is all in great condition but just maybe some of the um aesthetics are a little dated um just by nature of the fact that the home was built in the eighties\nUm my advice would probably be to not make those upgrades and save the money it may mean you take a little bit less in terms of the sales price\nBut generally when you upgrade a home ah kitchens in bathrooms I'm In particular so close to when you sell you're not going to get a dollar for dollar return on those upgrades\nUm if it wasn't really bad condition and you just you know you then you would want to look at it but if it's in good condition just data ... um I Would not mess around with a a full bathroom renovation\n... I'm not a in a neighborhood a shuttle and about eleven hackers mhm and out and it's really pretty rural area\nYeah oh yeah it makes\nNo it doesn't in fact in that case I Would then I Would almost say say to not do the renovation I think that you know somebody looking for a Lebanese acre property down in Hampton\nUm you know they're sort of a unique buyer and I don't know that a a full bathroom renovation would be as compelling as probably the land itself and and you know giving them the opportunity once they purchased the home and come up and do the upgrade they want to do makes more sense\nSo combined with a hassle and the fact that generally that close to a sale the dollar for dollar return won't be there on your investment I Would advise not doing that bathroom renovation in working with a real estate agent to come up with an effective pricing strategy for the home in its current condition\nYou know there's a few things you can do John that are very simple that will make your bathroom look nicer you can do a good uh you know she can steam cleaned the tile that'll make it look nicer to grout\nRe seal the ground you can do things like changing the knobs on the drawers and for may be under a hundred bucks you could read you know put it in a new faucet things you can do yourself probably cost you less than three hundred bucks a make it look surprisingly new uh the only thing I the thing I worry about John is that\nIf I'm going to redo it I'm not going to well I don't want to put Fifteen grand into something I'm going to sell that maybe\nYou as a buyer don't really care for you know that if I was going to redo it I really do it in the basic basic thing just to make them look clean I can make all that claimed by myself so yeah that always there's a there's a catch their you know how much do I want to put it into a remodel I don't want to\nBe like you said you're not going to get a dollar for dollar back out of it you're more likely to be cheap about it and just to make it look clean but I think you can make on a plane\nBy yourself so that's great advice Dave I Would absolutely recommend sometimes a trip to Home Depot and the little elbow grease can do a lotta in even in the kitchen replacing ... does make a big difference is modernizing the design is that is a little bit\nYou're listening to the home fix that show a news Ninety five and a and seven fifty ws the the phone lines are open for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty I'm Dave Baker it was John ... from march Spain realty taking your calls on ws me [noise]\nNine twenty ... twenty four hour traffic center Seventy five southbound roadwork from Canada down to ... right lanes blocked the ramps up at north and south leads on both sides also shut down that's causing heavy delays back to five Seventy five\nOnce they reopen you can use the express lane or you can use highly forty one is an alternate you can also take\nUm highly Ninety two over to Georgia four hundred and use that to get back down to ... if you like as well on the outside he left lanes blocked on the outer loop and to write lanes blocked on the Internet to decide between Boulder crashed in twenty two planes also shut down in early ... west bound from Jonesboro overpass I Seventy five Jill Nelson speak\nHours likely confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh to the high court President Trump taking victory lap with just a tweet saying very proud of the U.S Senate for voting yes\nTo advance the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh the president's pick potentially shifting the balance of the Supreme Court fermenting solid size for conservative majority with a ...\nIt's kind of appointment Democrats speaking on the floor overnight Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed this hour questioning Kavanaugh's testimony in temperament emerge\nHad his second hearing combative blatantly partisan disrespectful\nEvasive and no way reassuring that he has told the truth this body and the American people\nIn the Senate expected to take up the full vote later this afternoon\nI'm Michelle friends and ABC name and we will likely hear from President Trump tonight as he'll be at a campaign rally in Topeka, Kansas which starts at seven thirty\nSports in Athens the dogs will be hosting Vanderbilt tailgate show right here on WSBIU radio starting at three thirty kick off at seven thirty baseball the Dodgers beat the Braves three zero so the Braves down to games is a must win for the Braves tomorrow night at centrists WSBIU time\nComing up on nine thirty two we'll check traffic and whether next\nSuffering Kevin ... confirmation from emotional testimony to the Supreme vote I Want us being covers the breaking news brings you end up in this story on\nFive AM's seven fifty W.

and I live in a thirty five year old home that nature a lot of work and I'm going to have an eight to eventually lead to house and\nSo I'm trying to figure out whether it you try to find a flipper you sell it as is I don't have the resources to do a lot of renovations so and it no even how you approach it or do you tell talked to a real estate agent about the best way to sell the house that need for bears\nYeah I Would start with the real estate agent and having them do a walk through 'em and you know some of the things you can do that are a little less expensive are painting the home putting a fresh coat of paint on it makes a huge difference cleaning the windows\nUm if there is some wear and tear on the carpet may be considering a consider replacing the carpet those types of upgrades um you know are less expensive than sort of a full renovation but make a big difference um but you know similar to John in Hampton I really wouldn't encourage a huge total renovation it sounds like maybe the resources aren't really there to do that anyway\nUm so just getting the home and really clean condition fresh coat of paint clean windows\nAnd uh you know at a minimum maybe a steam cleaned on the carpet and make a huge difference I'm In a good real estate agent could even recommend potentially a staging company who could come in and help a work with the what you have and just positioning the furniture and the decorations and a way to make the most appealing\nUm you know in terms of sold as is a I don't necessarily recommend to clients to use that language sometimes for a buyer they they um think that well maybe there's something hidden or maybe their issues with the home\nBut allowing the buyer to do the inspection and working with a strong real estate agent with good negotiation skills who can help you navigate that inspection process and look out for your best interests um but that would be my recommendation just you know pay carpet some of the simple things easier things that are a little less expensive that make a big impact in terms\nTo the home showing doesn't real estate agent and when asked this question for cats are and there's a real estate agent know of people

FM doorbell er Cox media group station\n[noise] at one twenty four hour news weather and\nFive and a um\n\nKnow good morning it's ten o'clock\nI'm Robin ... live in the ws be twenty four hour news center with our top story this hour\nI think he's highly qualified for the court\nThat is millennia Trump in Egypt weighing in on Brett Kavanaugh the final vote on his confirmation scheduled for five o'clock today that's just seven hours from now the latest in this special report from ABC News\nAnd um so we have multiple opportunities as well as some inside sales opportunity so website outlines those fill out the application and someone will be in touch right away to set up an interview\nExcellent I'm going to ask you about a program that you guys have been running I've been hearing the ads for him but first rent talked to Janice and low burn Janice you're on the home fix that show good morning\nMorning and thank you for taking my call thank you for calling [noise] actually my issue is\nWe bought a house last year and it was built in Nineteen eighty apparently they didn't believe in it after it's then\nWe have two bathrooms they're both pretty much the size of a powder in with a top ... a little like a large room with the town well in a master bedrooms we have a walk\nIn closet which is right next to it and so we can basically knock down the law and used to walk in closet and there's another closet air that we can buy out and make it into a law walk in closet\nIs it worth the cost of doing it as far as resale value is it worth it\n[noise] so how long do you anticipate you'll be in the home\nNot long or five years\nOr I Would recommend doing it um kitchens bathrooms do sell homes or early we took a call where the the gentleman was planning on selling in a few months\nIn that case I wouldn't recommend doing it but in this case you'll be able to enjoy the new bathroom you know um it'll add value to your your life and\nUm you know it'll be something that you know I'm sure once it's completed you'll\nBe happy that you've done it and then over time that dollar for dollar will catch as the market rises in value\nAnd uh since once again a most buyers are sort of wild by the kitchen and bathroom really nicely appointed master bathroom makes a big difference um particularly where you're still able to have that walk in closet because that that would be my fear if you if you sacrificed too much closet space\nUm it may backfire a little bit\nBut um no I think that makes sense and I think that once again you'll get to enjoy it for a few years as well and um you know it seems like a good bet and my my eyes\nGreat thank you that's what I needed to know\nPlus you'll be able to enjoy that new bathroom smell for a while that's right\n[laughter] oh that'd be so much fun\nWith life rather than the old ... [laughter] I can tell you that\nThanks to the world are you thank you\nFor all for eight seven to zero seven fifty is the number still have time for a couple more calls I'm under the er the the the guidance that\nIf I'm going to live in a house for more than three months I wanted to be the way I wanted to be yeah so I don't think I should hesitate to knock down a wall or put it in a bathroom or because I'm living in a house I Want to enjoy the house yeah I don't want to be cramped in my powder room or whatever\nI I just say go ahead and do it now in five years is is plenty of time but you know enjoy your house you're going to live in it and it's going to I think no matter what you upgrade it in a house it may not be dollar for dollar but it's going to improve the resale value of that house correct if you make a man cave in you know you put it in a new one or\nAre you buses out if you add a debt that's actually are pretty big return these days that is true but if you you know anything you do to fresh in that house is going to help that house selling the future so might as well enjoy it and go for\nIt at the key point I think that people make the mistake of uh thinking too much about the future value and not making the home work for them\nAnd I think generally if people do that it will add value down the line um you know you just have to be cautious ongoing too extreme you know maybe you know data and cave is a little too you know personal lives right but at the end of the day it's your homes\nAnywhere you want to share that can be any kind of I I hear advertisements on on WSBIU sure about marks than realty and they're not really the same that I've I've heard in the past you've always said mark has always been on our air saying if we can't sell your house will buy a house right but now I hear ads and\nThey will buy your house crowds like that's an option right off the bat we don't have to wait till we can't sell it will buy it right off the bat explain that you know because I also hear people calling it a rip off\nUh yeah so I mean to your point on the program has shifted it used to be would lift your home for a period of time and if the home did not sell at the end of that time period we would a purchase it\nUm but the reality was is that it wasn't really super compelling for some of our customers\nAnd so over the past few years is technology um has improved a data on real estate transactions has become an easier to gain access to 'em as well as um uh some folks entering the space um that have a sort of created what we would call sort of a new I buy her model\nUm we felt like we had to shift ours to be competitive and so\nActually how it works is if somebody calls in um you know there are some area restrictions conditional restrictions for example\nI'm over four hundred thousand and value um typically does not qualify for the program um and so what will happen is we'll have our a guaranteed offered apartment running analysis of the home um value we asked for a lot of data points from the home cellar on that initial phone call\nAnd we take those data points and were able to generate a cash offer if it kinda fits the parameters of the program\nAnd so then a real estate team will come out um we like to call her agents consultants because they are going to show you basically all of your options um you know market retail value um you know we can kind of work with a home so to even create a strategy where maybe they don't want the guaranteed offer but they need to sell quickly so we can price the home in a way to drive that\nAnd then the guaranteed offer and so we just put them side by side and so about Fifteen Percent of our home sellers opt to take the guaranteed offer um so the majority are still going be a market listing route I'm\nBuilding at your choices not you're not just take this offer an animal you're done\nAbsolutely we we want to be a full service broker with options for our clients you know in other words some companies only do the cash purchase some companies only are able to market your home or you know sort of what we would say the traditional way\nUm but for us we want to have options for our clients and customers so you know there is a discounted market value to be clear um but it's not an extreme or we're not a investors looking to you know uh some of the folks out there that you know send a\nLetters in the mail to folks who maybe recently lost a loved one that's not what this program is um you know depending on the circumstances it can be anywhere from a you know a five to ten percent discount\nI put my hundred thousand dollar house up and you're going to give me fifty five thousand for it and and I'm On my way I mean it's not that big of a again this is not a\nA huge because I heard someone talking yeah they're going to take thirty or forty percent of your what's your home's value is I don't know if I'm putting you know not not at all but this is what I heard that that doesn't sound like a deal\nBut well you know if we did that I don't know that we would be in business for much longer right um and so you know it's not for everybody to be clear but what we find is that folks that maybe have a\nYou know sort of a a you know some life change you know sometimes you have an unexpected job transfer a right to go and for me you know I'm very close with my wife and three children and you know I Would not want to be separated from them for three or four months waiting for you know a traditional market listing sale\nOr if I'm In Chicago right so you know I I Would be somebody that would be interested in this program um sometimes it's a state type sales where maybe a you know the mother and father's passed away and the children are left to deal with the state and\nUm for them they don't want to you know hang on to this process for a long period of time and then sometimes it's conditional issues that we took a call earlier where maybe the person had been in the home for thirty forty years and it just doesn't have the cash laying around to do a full renovation\n'em and are willing to take that you know discounts so it's a it's a trade right it's do you want you know top dollar or do you want time inconvenience and you know for some time is money like they say\nUm and so for some it's more compelling just to take that offer so there to be clear there's an inspection period just like any other buyer we'd want to make sure that the homes in good condition um but uh once again it's a great program and I'm a we're excited about it a lot of folks in the community seem to be excited\nAbout it is just one of the options you get there is no this is your only bagel you get this is your an option you can do it this way you can do it this way we can take care of this way it's just another option out there and you want to or conditioning you weren't am FM stereo you know do you want that would have ... just another thing that goes into the days ended up selling them\nIs absolutely right we're just trying to be a little bit different and really our focus if you look at our mission vision and values it's all about providing an unparalleled quite experience and you know we're not perfect so we you know we're always trying to improve but this just as a new way to add value to our clients and
