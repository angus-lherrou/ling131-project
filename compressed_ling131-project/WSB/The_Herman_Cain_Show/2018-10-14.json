S. B.\nTalk good morning so again we all know if you if you if you were alive this week you know that we serve really rough week in markets\nThe other thing here now that the Dow stands in the twenty ... twenty five thousand range of today were twenty five thousand three thirty nine is were closed recently but ... when you have a Dow Jones bits numerically that large\nAnd relative to over ... when we were doing money matters in two thousand nine when the Dow is in six thousand range a five percent drop on twenty five thousand is a very big number\nA again one percent is two hundred and fifty points so you get a day or any sort of numerical\nA on a percentage basis you get these really large numbers and I think part of the fear that creeps into markets is that hey we were down three point five percent in a day well that's\nEight hundred some points so it really really kinda catches a our attention\nSo we live in this world where it's just hard to ignore this and you're going to see it everywhere um so but we also know we go through these corrections would go through ... ... you have a five percent correction as a matter a couple of days it is kind of nerve wracking if we had a five percent\nCorruption and I and I sent out a note to clients this week actually an audio know very quickly because I wanted to give folks are thoughts on that kind of where what what's happening in the world where we live in and what what's\nHappening from an investment standpoint if if it's really the speed that it is concerning I think when you get a cut two days and you drop that quickly it's the speed that makes people nervous if we we just five percent over the course of five months who can steadily last one percent a month [noise] really\nNobody would carry you wouldn't you wouldn't be worried you wouldn't be nervous maybe a little frustrated that hey we haven't really gone anywhere for five or six months here it happens in two days that's what makes investing so nerve wracking\nCouple of points that that I Want to talk about here today or that and and just share some thoughts about where we think we sent number one despite how terrible this week was softer still positive on the year I'll be a very slightly they're still positive\nHistorically it's very normal to have kind of go nowhere which is kind of where we are close to new where on the year in a midterm election cycle\nWe know that historically years two years after the presidential election we get in the midterms we have a kind of markets to do a lot\nIn till the elections are over and we still have several weeks before that happens so we've got we've got to get in ... we got to get to November sixth and order or early November\nGet the elections out of the way and then typically that when markets kind of do the best the final couple of months of the year so that's number one is that a we're still positive be we didn't expect to have that great of year because it is a midterm election year number two the economy continues to hit on all cylinders\nWhich is really it even though the economy continues do well it's also one of the main catalysts for this market correction\nKind of ironically the economic strength we're seeing\nIs the very thing that's prodding the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates and hike rate's higher and higher and higher\nIt was only December twenty Fifteen not that long ago when the fed funds rate was still zero zero zero because the economy's still hadn't kind of got it ... the economy is still stuck in the mud at that point since then\nThe fed is not only pushed rates higher but they've also they've also increase the pace of rate hikes in twenty eight team\nThe bond market by the way so it's not just the fed the bond market itself this massive thirty forty trillion dollar market also as a safe zone interest rates\nAnd the bond market has has pushed rates higher alongside the fat\nThat the ten year treasury started this year in about two point four percent we ratcheted to three and a quarter or this past week we finished a little bit lower than three and a quarter\nBut that's a big new and it's a quick move we finished on friday three point one four percent down from where we were earlier in the week\nSo we get this good news is bad news scenario to some extent the sell off in part due to the strong economic backdrop\nUh but but that backdrop has added fuel to the interest rates ... going higher and higher and higher\nOr in in the grand scheme of things even though it feels as though interest rates have moved a bunch of three point one five percent treasury rate is a lot closer to being normal so rather than saying ... interest rates are are getting aggressive and high they're really just getting back to normal\nIf the normal range is four to four and a half percent for the ten year\nFor the last couple of decades to where we are today is a lot closer to normal than back when rates were at one and a half percent or closer to or one and a half percent for for so long so this is this process of normalization is a net positive from a I'm a big picture perspective\nAnd it's to be expected that while we re adjusts interests higher we're going to have some from ... some bumps in the round exactly what we says all this week\nFor in this list tariffs are still a big concern um but but we I Am a big believer that we have kind of avoided a full blown global trade war I think that's off the table\nWe're talking about terrorists all year we ... we looked over the past year really at I look at this has four separate battles the United states versus Canada the U.S versus Mexico the U. S. versus the EU and the U.S versus China all four are important battles for the U.S [noise]\nBut the risk of a global trade war on all these separate of economic friends you know that's a big deal that would be economically devastating\nBut we just got an announcement not long ago does does it get a lot of press the about the U. S. MCA which is the new NAFTA the United states and Mexico Canada agreement which solves two of those battles so let's check off the list of problems Canada let's check off the list of Mexico\nThird battle the U.S or DU that has quieted down significantly\nAnd both both parties are had agreed to play ball and are they are moving towards what they call this is the U.S and the European Union is zero tariffs environment\nThat just leaves China so our trade relationship with China arguably it's gotten worse over the last several months and it might take years to solve\nBut the ... the positive impact of solving really most of our trade disputes costs three out of four\nAnd if you look at the dollars involved it's about three quarters of\nOur trade relations is solved because now sorts or put away with the New Mexico and Canada solved we've got about a quarter of that group which is now so China that's the one trait that's the one tariff battle or trade battle that we're going to continue\nTo be stuck in for a long time we can handle one we just couldn't handle for\nThe good news here is that as much as you hear about trade I think we're in a decent place and and we're not in a place where this one particular disagreement with China can bring down our economy just can't does not powerful enough\nTo do that despite the headlines are we gonna run here and they were going to go to the phones we come back the number again for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty or listening to money matters\nMore money matters straight at [noise]\n... let's say twenty four hour traffic center heavy construction delays in Marietta Seventy five and went down between dump wrote to sixty once you can go next to sixty seven four\nRight lanes want their use highly forty one the express lane to get around it\nI don't have to decide west down between Seventy five to calm parkway exit Nineteen that roadwork blocking too right lane also watch for construction as well on four hundred north down between pilgrim mail like the sixteenth you brown spreads to write lanes are closed in ... west down Jonesboro robotics at fifty five to Seventy five\nTo ... downtown connect are going to get stacked impact with the uh\nA game a at Mercedes been stadium falcons at one o'clock and also the pride parade that starts at at the civic center Marta station merges off a Ralph McGill to Piedmont Park Peachtree Jackie lead W.

every Sunday army haven't been lived overseas been at least for a [noise]\nGood morning walk into money matters here on a Sunday\nMorning [noise] the number of the studio for for eight seven to zero\nSeven fifty he west how can you be so sure of the economy is in good shape doesn't the stock market dropped tell us something is wrong and I answer this into two ways number one I Want to talk about market history as to where we are in this economic cycle\nBefore we took a call before we we talk with him I said look\nWe've solved a big chunk of the trade disputes three out of the four battles are we we have been a kind of engaging in we've effectively we've come to an agreement Canada Mexico you still haven't come to a degree with China that may take a long time\nAnd I don't think that that in itself has a material impact on earnings remember earnings in the U.S have remained a really strong and they are the main driver behind higher stock prices over the last couple of years we're about to start when we just started this past week third quarter earnings season\nAll indications point towards a very strong earnings season probably something like on the order of twenty percent higher from where we were last year\nIn till Chinese tariffs start to take a material bite out of that number\nMarkets are very likely respond to these positive earnings were were were just starting to see for the third quarter but that's that's that's why this sell off they'll unsettling doesn't make me nervous\nThere's no one issue that that causes a sell off ... you can call it ... rising rising interest rates continue tariff war with China a trade or trying to mid term election cycle but at some point US Economy\nIt right now the U.S economy is is very strong there's really no recession or on the horizon and when I say ... horizon I I mean not just the next three six months arguably into twenty twenty\nAnd in ... we we at some point we're going to go we will that will change and we'll go back into recession at some point markets will drop\nBut in the interim ... we just were not there yet economically things are still too good to fall off a cliff anytime soon so these corrections ... likely the one we just saw this week even though there are unsettling in my opinion and they remain but I Would call viable pull back\nThere never fun but these are the exact events that make everyone so nervous and it makes this is what makes investing how difficult you know it's not for the faint of heart\nBut I take solace in having a a very diverse fight for ... portfolio\nA variety of different asset classes and within those ... acid classes high quality securities and on the stock side high quality securities on the bond side and to me that gives me peace of mind during these periods of temporary and I'll stressed that were temporary pain\nNot permanent pain Pam called from William send in and said look west I sold out of all my stocks this week window I get back in this and that's a hard no I don't I don't the answers I don't know exactly when we could have another ... this ... this correction that we're in right now could end up being a ten percent or a Fifteen Percent or right\nI I still don't think so because the earnings are are starting to come in are solid that the market kind of wakes up and said oh OK well companies really making money again we're not going to continue to drop stocks will continue to dropping earnings do really well typically\nAnd again we're getting to the mid term election cycles that's typically good for socks getting the mid term elections out of the way so what next couple of months really November December typically really good for markets and what I said to him was look I Know that it might be

with us from the gators\nHey man thanks root for hanging on the ... question really will get right back to this is that hey we've got closed and funds they're they're floating rate closed and funds you would think they'd be fine during an environment where interest rates are going higher\nAnd yet you're closed and fund or your clothes and puns or down here's the here is a really important variable and you probably know this but for our listeners I'll remind you that close in funds are actually really inefficient one of the few areas in the market that I Would say it's kinda the opposite of this this um\nOf of of real efficiency\nAnd because they have this new shares not created or destroy that just a fixed number of shares you can get some huge miss pricing Ken\nUh between what ... what the bonds and there are really worth versus what it is trading for\nAnd in an environment where everyone just kind of selling everything in almost panic mode like we saw this week closing funds kind of get caught up in that tide and making yet I Would say miss priced really easily and in this case to the downside\nAnd I think that's really kind of where we are in the closed and fund world is that they're inefficient and their midst priced when people get nervous they kinda sell everything enclosed and funds get hit I Would say disproportionally bat\nThey also use the leverage or not all of them is the one you're talking about are the ones we this example that we're using today it uses a bunch of leverage and when you're using leverage you got this close advisors borrowing money right\nSo if you're borrowing money you're using a leverage closed and fun when rates go up the leverage gets more expensive\nTo think about and there there there's a large universities ... thinking about some of the closing funds that are not leverage and the ... and I think that you've just got to be patient here yeah as as closed and funds kind of go through this miss pricing phase\nA typically once they get to be ten Fifteen Percent discounts to what they're really worse\nThat when you want to own the east coast and funds because they typically revert back towards
