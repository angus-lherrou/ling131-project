...\nSo I went to bed last night in a they're expecting it to hit landfall as a category three I wake up this morning and now they say a category for what exactly changes there to create more energy\nWell it's a primarily the ah the category is based off the maximum wind up near the high but as we pointed out during Florence\nUh that's just a fraction of the total storm it extends three hundred miles across and so is that wind energy increases the total energy in the storm the kinetic energy increases\nAnd that means that's going to increase the battering waves that come on top of the storm inundation the way things are looking now it's entirely possible that are\nIn just a few hours the eye of the storm comes ashore as a high end the category for\n... and now after that it it comes ashore when do we expect to see some effects from this and what will that be\nWe're going to start seeing us some more showers picking up a late this afternoon in our area off of Michael and especially overnight and then the first thing tomorrow morning and uh that's what we'll also get some my wind gust\nAbout twenty miles an hour at ... or so during the daytime hours but then up to thirty four miles an hour at times tonight and tomorrow with a few gusts possibly up a closer to forty miles an hour especially south and east of the city and of course wants the U.S soil gets really wet\nIt doesn't take all that strong a win for some of the weaker trees the fall I mean heck around here we've had sunny days with a tree cause a power outage with a thirty mile an hour when\nThis the first thing I think when we get new situation suddenly those beautiful Georgia pines in my backyard to become a menace threatening menace to my home and my family exactly\nEvery time we got a storm I see more and more people clear more of those trees away from their houses so it's just not a factor any more\nUh uh ... obviously you're going to keeping an eye on this all day long live updates all day long on hurricane Michael thank you for a including us and hopefully you get a little bit of shut eye in the next forty eight hours or so but we appreciate it\nOh absolutely uh everybody follow me on Twitter at ... meter ws be all one word and off also my blog W.

knowledge will have you updated here on that I mean it's not\nCalled the counter certainty for a reason it's account of uncertainty and that's why you\nTo be ready for the uncertain the likelihood whatever next story I won't be able to say is a it is it's a big deal that it's the possibly going to hit landfall and be the uh the the largest\nA hurricane the most energy in recorded history but I Do like to put some because this is where we get into the whole climate change apology\nAnd the limits happening and it's going just a little bit of perspective\nWhen it comes to hurricanes recorded history is Eighteen fifty one hundred and sixty Seventy years on a planet again four point five billion years old go ahead\nI got to headlines about Brett Kavanaugh\nAs the first one well do I get to choose to do I want to know so it's sort of wait wait a minute I'll ask the experts I get to choose no rights I guess is this is this is my show no go ahead well Kavanaugh\nHired a team of four women to court for him and he used the phrase the first Supreme Court justice to do that\nNo no no wait a minute come on they didn't tell me that on CNN what what he must be doing that because it really good luck and he's just going to hit on him oh no no wait are you telling me out on Dr Ford\nAnd if I just wanted to make sure that they had some caffeine and you will do to make sure that there's coffee and Coca Cola for right now I have never done this before so they could have like a coke okay Dr Ford thank you I appreciate that you're always you're always thinking about the women and how they won't need\nMaybe a little tired and a little nervous caffeine menial copied and\nCoffee or Glenda sign up something along those lines you know something about them up [laughter] so so much piano and I'm happy thinking Oh thank you doctor for a church\nI again I I uh I I Know it can't possibly be the fact that Brett Kavanaugh\nWho has been sold to us is the biggest one woman hate or in the history of America\nAre you telling me that he has more female law clerks as a matter of fact all of his law clerks are female and wait a minute you didn't tell me neither to anybody else that's the most to ever that's correct so Brett Kavanaugh is actually a giving more women\nMore opportunity for high careers in law than any other Supreme Court\nJustice in the history already I'm Glad we got that out there because I find that hard to believe a man who well hates women so obviously would do anything to help women probably he just did it as a result to put it in the face of the people who\nDid that to him during the ... oh no no wait a minute no oh he's always done this his whole career\nMade sure that women had opportunities that law they wouldn't otherwise have oh that's an interesting piece of news do you think more people would report that I'll be darned I saw a story yesterday that uh he actually ask questions\nYeah yesterday yesterday was his first official day on the bench and we're still here we're all still alive\nHe probably ask where's my beer yes probably was do we have here I think my first question the republic is still here a guy like hard to believe I don't know I Know that we thought the world was going to anyone Brett Kavanaugh took the bench get them all week give them a way to fill destroy this country this is what I've heard a ban on who's been done the narrative\nIs too strong I Can't even be hurt anymore [laughter] this is why I decided\nThat there is too strong to be wrong [laughter]\nSo we're just going to go with like\nThat strong to be the uh\nIt's funny because most of the reporting that I saw about that people were surprised that he asked questions like you're on the Supreme Court now you don't have to you know what I'll Wait a few cases before I speak up you you have all the authority you'll ever have the second\nYou're sworn in so\nYou do that you deserve to like at least a week off after everything he went he jumped right at the job you know what\nI I Know that is usually want to go to Hawaii or some\nSort of what he did yeah yeah I mean the\nOvertime no matter what really happened or didn't happen he could have used it a little bit of time to go out\nWe started the coauthor his thought we start the court session the first Monday of every October so if it was if it had actually wrapped up when it was supposed to he would have had maybe a week or so to acclimate before he died many day it's just one it would be nice to have one you know what I'm Wondering is how\nTo what level these women who are working for him hate women\nHow could they possibly be such traders to their own gender because there is a war and I'm following the news so I'm just telling you what I Know from the news men and women they all hate each other in this country and they are at war with each other so if ... if some of them are a female were to clerk\nFor Brett Kavanaugh well they're\nThey're going to the other side that's that's trader must be suburban white women model you want to you know as my hobby those women\nWho listen and vote exactly where their husbands tell them\nTo sit down a little bigger than it\nTakes some time but the world will always make CNN sense [laughter] 'cause every once in a while you just have to work it out so\nThat you know because they're women they will eventually be treated so poorly around all the white Republican men that they'll see oh yeah what we were fighting for I Know I heard joined us I don't even when\nI heard [noise] I heard that it was so exciting on

Feinstein is another [noise]\nThat\nSuffer words that I Would shoved us as being researched she's like Frankenstein monster\n[laughter]\nIt was about Senator Feinstein that's another [noise]\nThat's usually the documents well [noise]\n[noise] you're looking around\n[noise]\n[noise] no no we didn't [noise]\n\nBut everybody on every side just wants to lock up [laughter] you know I think we should open an investigation on the investigators who are investigating the investigation that's what we need\nIs eat other chance to above the lock her up with so twenty starting to get those getting kind of a you have\nCome up with something new all of this is his new bit\nBit is Dianne Feinstein\nAt the hearings because it was comical and no one will point out that it was comical other than the president but he was comical all the writers of Saturday Night live went right past them they didn't see that was comical at all that a Dianne Feinstein who's like eighty two years old but in the Senate from Nineteen whatever and uh she's asked\nA question like this looks around and says I don't know that we did what did you was it no I asked them they said no no one here lead to me while the rest of the country are you saying hey that that that really militant lady who refuses to smile behind you on your staff\nI guess a baby that was her [laughter] if I started my investigation who leaked I'd start with that really militant looking lady who refuses to smile who's sitting behind you the whole time that member of your staff I'd start with her as far as who perhaps leaked this whole thing about\nDr Ford will Trump had more to say about Dianne Feinstein as well she lake\nIt a hundred percent [laughter] [noise]\nWant to get sued Ninety nine percent see now I can get\nTheir hands match during our son is and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats are we've got a\nCouple of new ... new ah set pieces there we got that he did that have it both those lines before but I think that there are effective and he's going to be out there in the next four weeks\nHe's on the road he's he's like a comedian yeah work in the jokes on the road\nFirst of all if I go see his rally I don't want them to not do the great jokes he did a couple of nights ago when I see a comedian right Bernard reading material\nLast week as Iowa and maybe it'll start preventing people from filming them so that might sell you a freshman as Newt keep the kick the media I'll keep people that maybe it will turn their phones and met before that mad at time yes\nPresident he can't like have a Netflix special and then retire all that material [laughter] but I think this is highly effective we won't know until the midterms but my feeling\nIs it's just a gut feeling and you know that can be right or wrong even if you are right most of the time things can change I understand that so it's nothing more than a gut feeling but I don't think that most of the country reacted to\nTwo weeks of people screaming and hollering in getting in people's faces I don't think that they reacted as positively as CNN or Washington Post or New York times\nOr MSNBC would have you believe but it's just a gut feeling I Know there's a lot of energy I mean you can see the energy with the people who get another people's faces or just continually screaming\nBut I just don't think that I think that energy is with those people but I'm just not so sure there's persuasive\nYou're trying to persuade the independence the swing voters I don't think is very persuasive or but maybe there's such a hatred out there\nThat that ah that that's all the energy is going to be needed and there will be a blue wave I'm not predicting anything but my gut feeling is that most people\nWho are not hard core on the left to the right did not respond positively to what they saw\nFrom the the so called resistance over the last couple of weeks I people are getting tired of seeing imagery of\nPeople being a bullied out of restaurants and and that sort of thing it's a it's a it's a mob mentality and I know I Know that it's a mob mentality because the latest thing from the CNN's of the world is anybody who refers to it as a mob is a\nHorrible person so therefore I Know it must actually be a mosque [laughter] another works like a sociologist is gonna be a word a week at some point this is the question I Would like to ask\nOf a sociology professor is it possible to ever run out of dog whistles\nEvery week it's something new that oh what they really mean by that you know the word mob has been around for a long time and generally it means a whole bunch of people who are screaming at a a a smaller set of people and getting potentially violent\nI don't know Eric isn't that what we saw the last couple of weeks I aired you're showing your incandescent raged oh come on down\nBy adults and we all know the origin the or the original meaning can be\n... that can that can come from mob is disorderly yes heart a population that is disorderly yeah well that was that not the celebrities troubling as well as I ... disorderly a few at contain the order\nI think that the sociologist they need to elect a president of sociology and that president every week and tell us what three new words are now not going to be taken at face value and their dog whistles that identify you as I\nSaid I Would like race ... here and the\nPresident of sociology at America yet they might as well make them president because we tell you something\nSociologist run this country now they run they may decide the parameters of all debate and discussion it's really I'm hoping it's an era I America goes through different nothing last forever so\nNow we can use the air I I Would just like you to pay attention to what that me and it was when you have to work around yet\nSwell down some people and they refer to an air rather referring to a period of time and now if you read the time in our history have been troubling so yeah so you know when he was like you to think about what you're saying and what it might mean to some people\nUh you you used the word troubling the other one that is that whenever I see this now and then I've just been hip to this whenever I see this in any\nDiscussion I'm reading anything the word problematic yeah that's always we haven't really identified a problem but it's problematic\nWhat the hell does that mean that that's just an opening hey whatever kind of grievance I can just jump in here is under the umbrella of problematic\nProblematic is when something that you think courts day is troubling to\nPut this show is problematic\nI agree and that's why I'm here [noise]\nYou're the ombudsman [noise] excuse me [noise] oh I'm Sorry because blood is
