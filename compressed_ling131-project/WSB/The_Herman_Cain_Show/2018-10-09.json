Laffer Roxy Music or John Prine in a ... I see to me it doesn't even really matters\nThe concept of a it's not like if you are the best pitcher in America is the best baseball pitcher in America and you're from the smallest town in America\nThe major leagues will find you your talent will be found\nYou'll start pitching as usual here in small towns the word but get out scouts will come and find you you'll end up on a major league team you'll have a career and then people will decide based on your stats whether you belong in a legitimate hall of fame like the baseball hall of fame here's the problem with music\nThere is a good possibility that I've never heard the best rock and roll band of all time because maybe they only we're together from Nineteen sixty seven to Nineteen Seventy one and they never really got passed a\nMinneapolis Saint Paul area see what I'm saying that it's possible that most of us have never heard the best rock band\nHowever is not possible that if you the best baseball pitcher in America but you're not going to be found so sports hall of fame makes sense but music is subjective and so what's happening since we're not making any more big rock and roll bands is over time\nEveryone's going to get in and then you just expand what rock and roll means so you bring in rap and you're bringing Madonna and the whole thing is ridiculous but then again\nWhat do I care why am I spending the first twelve minutes of my show on this I don't give a damn give me some real new\nAlright big story here today is the last eight to register to vote here in Georgia for the midterm elections like Stacey Abrams or you're like Brian given the editorial racy got registered today\nI got to choose between ah the guy who points a gun at a teenager\nThat's one ad tells the and then I got a ... or the lady who apparently ran for governor just so we can have more pedophilia rounds [laughter] I mean I I hear that uh that cap is not doing very well\nAnd uh I'm I've got to wonder if it's because of two things won his primary campaign may have just been too weird for people in in general and uh then I just think that the opening salvo of even\nEven if you don't believe in Stacey Abrams a programs ideas I don't I'm not a liberal I don't believe in those kind of socialistic\nThings you know our people really going to buy the idea that she's a she's a fan of uh pedophilia that seems like I I just don't think that I don't think it's going to land with people and so I think he comes off as a you know a bit of a goofball\nNot to not to mention too when I've seen a lot of people with Instagram post 'cause obviously he's doing his state wide\nAnd so people will get pictures with them and putting that I saw the UGA again yeah so in Tempe took a picture of them too and there's something I Know appearances shouldn't be a factor but\nHe's the only gonna weird smile mountain range yeah strange like it's like it's not a smart but it's a nice a smile on morphine seat or is it true his his smile seems insincere that doesn't mean that it's inside he gives a smiley a great guy\nBut uh the smile seems insincere but I look I Know that states like Georgia are certainly bluer than they used to be but they're still read it's not time for a a Stacey Abrams to beat\nA a a a Republican and the state of Georgia and if it happens now you got to lay it soundly on the camp camp\nOr because what's gonna happen is\nIf he loses it means people just didn't get excited about them and they didn't get off the couch and they didn't go out and that's what seems like what's happening right now a little bit that I don't sense a whole lot of excitement amongst Republicans\nAbout Brian Kemp to get like four weeks left against or something up but I Would say here's a good idea I heard Elizabeth Warren is coming into town to uh give a speech for Stacey Abrams alright get rid of the ridiculous pedophilia nonsense which isn't true and nobody's buying\nAnd just\nTake clips from Elizabeth Warren's saying how much she loves Stacey Abrams and put that in your ads I mean this this is not difficult\nUh but they don't seem to be it's not a very well run campaign you know doing a great job in the primary uh means zero in the general election that's just that's just the pre game and they don't seem to have had a second I\nWill maybe it'll open the door for the mysterious had met to running a liberty the libertarian candidate is he is falling consistently uh two percent so I'm saying is that perhaps he could possibly if he works hard to get to point three poor point you might even though I I\nI just I feel like in this kind of a libertarian still even really run I don't I don't see I don't know what Ted Mets looks like and I've probably seen them already in this political climate area don't you think that a libertarian or any third party for that matter could really make a run and\nThey should be able to but not the libertarians let me tell you something I Love my libertarians but a ... a party they are not\nThe party in name only they don't really understand there's something that uh people need to understand about parties this applies to every party Republican Democrat libertarian whatever their their ... and this is the Republicans who called other Republicans rhinos don't understand parties exist for one reason\nTo win elections like your favorite sports team and exist for one reason to win games how do you judge it how many games were one house party judged what is the only the single criterion by which party should be judged\nDo you win and by that single criteria and\nLibertarians have never won anything of any consequences whatsoever so it's not a real and I would say the same thing to my Republican friends who like to point to other Republicans and say you are not pure enough\nYou're not a real Republican you're not understanding what a party is a party is not just supposed to be the pure and the faithful you've got to reach out to get a bunch of people that can't get them to the polls and\nThen you get a government that kind of goes the way you want that's about the best you get out of this world a

Kavanaugh and his family at the White House's ceremonial swearing in last night's uh here's Mr Trump speaking about it\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett\nAnd the entire cabinet or family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nI'm Glad he did that now it's not difficult to see where you could blame Trump for the fact not blame him solely but certainly\nThe the fact that the political conversation in this country has gotten so vulgar ... ... ... you can't say the Trump stands outside of that\nHe's a he's a large part of that but what a Brett Kavanaugh in his family were forced to indoor is a it's beyond the pale and the and the fact that people don't realize this at this point astonished me\nThe most important thing that I learned in the last four or five weeks I said this yesterday is it there is a group of people some of them in power\nWe don't know how large of a contingent they are as\nA voting bloc but they're out there there's a group of people in this country who think it's OK from time to time if the issue means enough to them then it becomes okay to remove the presumption of innocence from those who are are alleged to have done\nBad things that's that's an eye opener for me but I feel a little bit is if I'm On an island I mean I Know I'm not alone on that island\nBut I Can't believe it I Can't relate to the fact that the entire country isn't beside themselves about this\n... this isn't the number one talking point can you believe we found out there's a segment of society thinks it's okay to get rid of the presumption of innocence after someone who's been accused\nThat's a lot bigger deal than\nA lot of

CNN is reporting and so I say that\nI can see out here it's on it's on all of the sudden I was twenty four hour\n... she's always kinda been what Trump ever since she's\nBeen great and I hope that this isn't some kind of scandal is reason that she's leaving because I'll be honest with you know people may laugh at me but I've\nI've looked at her and thought that could be the first female Republican president one day she seems very highly confident you know that she didn't necessarily agree with Trump in a lot of ways but learn how to play the game and be a very good UN ambassador and she's a good you know if you're going to have a Republican governor\nA southerner who was a woman of color who is really competent up I mean president you got to have a Republican president that's a good place to go um I really hope she didn't\nDo something stupid also this watchdog group called the citizens for ethics is tweeting now they said ah we're calling for an investigation into seven private flights taken by Nikki Haley that were paid\nFor by South Carolina business executives her husband was also involved as last year was governor wants you to see what I'm Bad at it seems like it was when she did they let us before the United nations right exactly so obviously this is extremely fresh and as it gets to develop will bring a lot of sort of news is fresh\nRiver news [laughter] refer to it as brave you yes this is really moist knew any of that stuff out of the of it last night so we don't quite know how it's going to taste a boy I Hope that she didn't wreck things 'cause I thought she had a really good career in front of her\nAnd how hard is is with politicians is like that we deal with the you know the aftermath of the read administrator and then in Atlanta\nIt's not hard to it's not difficult to not be corrupt and people in that position and I'm not judging you 'cause I'm I'm leaning towards I Want to give her her do\nBut she should have known better if she did this here it is are you a politician and waiting are you Eighteen years old and you want to be a politician pay for every damn right your take you know what whatever the bill is one of five or on top\nOf my ... my dad's credit card here's ray you're scandal and once you become governor keep your dad paying for your over\nAnd they found those ... and why it's so hard for politicians when you work politicians and you didn't have the power you had to drive your asked\nThere but I don't understand why people want to get I don't want to get into that bubble I don't want to get into that cloud of oh he's got a private jet for me you know you know well I\nSigned that Twenty one million dollar contract I think the private jet was just next to the very last second\nI mean you were close to getting it now look that was a private jet that they will give me as part of my contract okay gotcha well at least it was contractually I realized after a while but I Would have no need for a private jet to get from Roswell to pizza for [laughter]\nSo I was just to avoid that four hundred and ... yeah that's what I'm thinking is smiling mark picks me up in the morning drop me off spending like a helicopter as what I mean you could really hurt\nThe traffic as he's delivering you backed Debbie\nOh now you've got to add some zeros to a contract if I'm working on a fire I made more money on a friday and helicopter rides but\nI mean this this is the way that it should be the minute you win the election I don't care what the position is\nYou pay for every ride\nYou pick up the check at every lunch this is how you lay your head down on the pillow at night knowing that when you wake up you will have the same world and set of circumstances as when you went to sleep it is not difficult to not be a jerk\nPay your own way in the world if you can't afford it don't go if and if you're not a politician by the way if you can't afford it don't buy it\nUnless food and you need it [laughter] what's wrong with people's brains hey well I Can't afford it but I really liked that car I'll pay for it for eight years\nSmart move that's the same kind of thinking that a politician who accepts arrives on a private plane you should be thinking as you're walking I was a private plane I'm gonna turn around and walk back down to the tarmac\nI'm going to be the politician who never caught on a private plane if the president invites me to ride with him on air force one I'll get on because that plane was going that direction anyway\nBut the idea that you're a politician and you're accepting free plane rides from people who own industries in your state\nI'm assuming this is when she was governor\nWill know more shortly our job is your job as a politician is not just not to be corrupt\nBut to not have even the with corruption around you have to bend over backwards to not even appear corrupt if you're not willing to do that just go into industry or something get out of the politics game\n[noise] doctorate everyday beginning and I think very much do you have to be ... doctors on call of\nBreaking news from when you ask me twenty four hour news this\nMorning it's twenty minutes
