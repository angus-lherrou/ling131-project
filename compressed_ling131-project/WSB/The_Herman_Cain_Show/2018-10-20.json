number I ask more questions but the important thing is the listener so\nLet's go to them because we're on this show just for you listeners like Luke incoming look first call on a Saturday morning you're on the home fix that show a day Baker and Shawn Harris from fifty floor\nHey how you doing doing well\nAh I was calling because I'm having some like fleur oh you like a water leakage problems and I was wondering what you what your opinion on what we thought\nWell depends on what the what the weakest you know the source of the lake\nOh I've got like this like this coloration on my floor and the I guess the bathroom and also on the floor next to the room when my uh ... ac unit ... concerned there's some kind of drainage problem or something like that I'm not really sure\nYou know you're going to have a problem with the unit the or the condensation drain may not be draining it will clog up in the water will spill over if the uh there's little panda ... pounds of nature and if it doesn't catch everything or if it doesn't drain it will it will come out\nYou know we've had a lot of hot weather so there could be a lot of moisture out a lot of times with the Japan or drain it'll shut your unit down because it won't want to collect any more water but\nYeah that could be at the actual unit stop a couple of the time that's starting to think of that was because they conditioning\nThat could easily be a problem you need a heating and air guy to come out Cory give cool recall they can come out and fix that day long clogging\n... another important thing to do is they'll show you how to help keep it on clogged so you want to have this problem in the future also you never had this problem again but it'll be harder for the for the cloud to come back now what kind of Florida you have in your bathroom\nA I think both of them have it's really cheap like ... or ... that killed up very easily\nSo it'll it'll be easy to replace what's his wants swelling up to the sun floods possibly sub floor or just\nYou know enough moisture as as cause that bond\nTo the vinyl it's actually just kind of broke away so you know but it'll it won't be a hard fix the biggest thing is getting the the leak addressed first uh than people on the floor back led to dry out and every place in that that will be the easiest part of this whole thing most likely\nYeah that's definitely what you want to do first is get the leak repaired so that that problem goes away now if he if he needs new annoy him for example would just be something that it can just put over the old ... does he need to ...\nOkay you know you if if the ... if you're putting vinyl over vinyl and it's sitting down nice and solid you can go right over the top of it and it's it's fine but if it's appealing at all then you know it'll telegraph through a lot of times you'll end up her ashes\nWhat what's the cut off date from having as best as senior linoleum I think it was in the late seventies late seventies yeah I mean there's I'm sure there are houses out there are still having that\nIs why are we still we still run into quite a few of them and you know if if we know they have as best as

of them are glued down\nBut most of them in er lock and click together 'cause really the floating floor you know so there's no glue involved and even around the edges heating around the edges and so there's there's different products obviously there's some where there's a perimeter glue and others you know where it has tape around the edges that locks the two pieces\nUm and a lot of them nowadays

how ... ...\n... yeah you're on the radio what can we do for you oh this is your husband speaking Bob\nI was gonna say [laughter]\nUm we bought a house and we had landed up within Fifteen Years ago\nAnd it's still pretty good in some places but it's really starting to show its age is and its moon down is there any options other than taking it up and taking except for up\nTo change this out\nWell the the glue down products are most likely it's ... and engineers would\nBut it's they it's like a man okay\nBecause typically those aren't aren't glued to yourself before but uh if it is glued uh you you definitely wouldn't want to do it yeah\nYeah you you'd want to get that up you know we could we could come out take that up before you put anything else down\nBut the the ... floor adhesives that they use a or the Florida he says there use you can usually take the product itself up without having to replace the sub floor so it'd be\n... it is a little bit of a task to get the glue down products up off the sub floor but\nIt can be done and then you can put your new floor down\nThis friend and or Bob need to do that or is that something\nYou know that's something we take care of the ... you don't want to be trying to do that I Am most in most cases with blue down products we use a a big machine scraper that\nThat actually a uses you know a lot of force to to pry that floor up uh so you're if you were doing it it it'd be the most labor intensive thing you'd probably want to do around your house for\nSure yeah it's\nA large area it must be it must be close to a thousand square feet\nYeah that's no problem but just just give us a call will come out and we'll take a look at it and we'll tell you exactly you know what your options are uh you know and we'll price at all and accordingly healed but like I said we'll get all that floor up and then put down whatever you want for the new flooring\nThanks for the call friend now he had a friend that was bombed and that was definitely Bob yeah I thought that was his friend came she put this isn't she anyway you mentioned engineered one and lamb and I think a lot of\nLot of people do that that they think it's the same as it is a laminated process how they would make that engineering would what's the difference\nUh well laminate is a lamb and I like I was telling you before it's a it's a composite surface you know so kind of feels like a plastic a almost a\nThe engineering would an actual wood and its layer the same way plywood has made so you have a layer of glue a layer of wood layer of glue would and then you have a veneer\nOf whatever product whether it's hickory or oak a maple division ear on top of the species that you're trying to you know get to look the desire to look for\nNow can you are saying down an engineer floor now and there are some\nThat you can they say that you can screening coat them which is basically a you know taking down through the clear coat getting some of the surface scratches and then re apply a but it is a very delicate process\nOkay you still sell engineered would oh yeah definitely yet which is more popular not engineered or the\n... and ... depends on the areas in in an area like this you know your your salad would they're probably the the more desired or in areas you know some of our southern markets where we have a lot of concrete slabs an engineer products are about always self okay\nFor all for eight seven Jews zeroes seven fifty is the number David enact where it has a problem that all day and age have we can't do anything [laughter] we try but it doesn't usually come out correctly David what can we do for you\nIs David fighting Goliath much how much I've I've got I've got a game room\nThat has really old will know lamb and I pulled it all up to the concrete flooring\nAnd did a one of those big box retailers and got the tiles started laying down from the center point out but then I realize that several areas is not completely level\nAnd uh there's no way that the tile I've bought you started laying down can it you know kind of curve over those little on level points so how do I fix that\nIt generally uh you you definitely want to get that prep done before you're put in the towel down but uh now that you're there uh we we typically will grind down high spots\nUm and then use self level or on your low spots so just ... it depends on if you have enough working space to not mess up the title that you've already installed but\nAh yeah we we get a machine and actually\nLet's assume that are hunted ads are low spots and well then you just use a self leveling compound you pour a and let it sit and actually do like I said south levels uh take some you know depending on the product you use or have a cure a time of six to twenty four hours and then you could just proceed on\nOr has some guys can do oh yeah definitely\nNow I've already got the tile though would you ah lay the town that I have after\nYou fixed it or if they have to be your typical you we\nWe don't use other products just because the way we do our warranties um but you know ... if you'd call us out will will come out and take a look and see what you got and you know try to work with the anyway we can\nOkay I certainly appreciate your help sign up for all the hard work you guys do\nThank you David for all for eight seven to zero
