there's zero evidence\nI'm Talking about a word called evidence that you might have to find a dictionary before two thousand to really know what it means but I'm Talking about old school evidence the kind of evidence that mattered for ten thousand years before the last couple\nThere is no what you would call true evidence millennials I'm not talking about the word is you know it\nBut true evidence it would be zero evidence that climate change has something to do with the ferocity of the hurricanes lately\nIt doesn't help me sad that like every October and a half for a\nWhile for an airline been

offering an opinion on it I'm just telling you what I Know by what the word evidence used to mean\nThere is zero evidence of a causal link\nBetween climate change and the hurricanes we've seen in the last couple of years so she's badgering him about this and at one point Leslie stall says I'm going to give you one more chance to say what our interviews now\nOur interviews away for a reporter to get somebody on the record with what they believe\nOr our our interviews an opportunity to say the right thing interviews now or an opportunity for you\nTo finally get on board with the rest of us is that really what an interview supposed to be if you think Donald Trump's crazy because he don't think he doesn't think that men mankind is contributing to climate change that's your right and that's your opinion\nBut if you're interviewing him your job is simply to get his actual opinion on the record not afford him yet one more opportunity\nTo stop being heretical\nReally silly but then he got very I think defensive and says a couple of the odd things in that interview to be honest with\nYou yeah he talked about how of course the media is unfair to them and uh yeah\nThey went back and forth and then he ended up by saying well I'm depressed that you're not\nMaking around your answer when you did it for time\n... and that and you see an end me much differently on the subject I can say that I don't want to have that fight with you OK not if I were in the meantime I'm president when you're not [laughter]\nAnd [laughter] I'm a ... year and what have you know I have to say I don't\nRemember

Letterman and putting it right here\nDo you really think I'd call Russia to help me with an election gives me a break [noise] they wouldn't be able to help me at all [noise]\nRussia so ridiculous I ... that is so ridiculous and then ... I haven't really needs\n[laughter] anyone in red you know [laughter]\nSee I wouldn't have minded if most of the interview was kind of like that when when they throw that mainstream sort of garbage at you that's the way to deal with it with humor\nAnd deflected a and a lot of yeah right yeah and that's that that should be his response to most of this stuff\nBut he gets he gets sucked in with Leslie stall who cares about Leslie stall I mean honestly who cares what she thinks they've had less [laughter]\nWhile it [laughter] you know I I just uh I don't know why he gets so\nDefensive\nWith someone like Leslie stall you should just walk in and say hey the economy's on fire this is what we're doing and then just sort of ignore the other questions or deflect them or handling with humor the way it did with the Russian one\nSo I mean I was watching that and I was like you're saying the right thing and then he starts saying stupid things [laughter] like ah people say at one point she got she was like what people say oh there's a lot of people you know people\nPeople have all their doctor for stuff to like uh oh hell yeah just the his defense was we want we want\nWhich was he was that that's what I mean is is to cede the ground on that they did when\nThey were right and I'll say it again I don't care if it's a mass exodus of listeners live on Hester doctrine and they never come back\nI'll wear a smile and do it proudly to say that uh the left was absolutely wrong on that based on one thing you always have the presumption of innocence always always always know carve outs no means none\nEver so he was right on that\nAnd yet he allowed himself to get kind of be pulled into her game and then said something stupid at the end\nLike well what's the matter we one\nThat's not even the right point of view of the right point of view is no it does matter even though we won because they destroyed a man's life that's the actual point of view the should have been coming across and it's what I think he actually believes but he gets caught up in this back and forth he gets defensive and then he just says something very you know just while we won\nIn all I think she was greeted with great respect all the other side what do you think do you think you treat it as a show ya I'd ask that just seemed to me saying why don't you know I I'm not going to get into it because we won it doesn't matter what we want\nTo [laughter] hoarders I may have one but when you want to be seen like a year can we ... getting the whole thing from a list Leslie stall seems to and I don't get this I

obvious problems with her appearance in front of Congress are off limits you can't go there\nYou simply can't go there who decided that who makes those rules and Leslie stall just understands that to

made that ruler where it came down but everybody who's not President Trump apparently understands this to be\nTrue [noise] where does that come from [laughter]\nWhy is it that she cannot be question

kind of open I don't think that you could find a radio station in this country this done anything for eighty years\nThis has to be the only radio station that has had one type of programming available for ... straight years so we're all about bulldogs and I think Kirby Smart is an amazing coach his his audio editors just after the last\nWe got to get better and that's where we gotta look ourselves and say okay who are we is this is this and we are because we consistently not played as ... as we need to leave and why and we haven't been as consistent as we need to often so that's who we are we had to get better and that's what we're gonna try to enough we got lands\nRelation you got to chop more would right\nAbsolutely I mean if you're you got to get out there we got to get to everybody's got to get a ... job but it's much food as possible and play better and chop wood harder and a dollar and play better and not losing\nThing hanging over the team that I think you're right it's it's offensive and defensive lines where all the work has to happen all the work almost all the work nine to ... percent but I think I think maybe Ninety One Ninety eight yes on a lot but the hundred I don't think we're disagreeing here actually\nUh I think that there's this thing hanging over the team with the two quarterbacks that's not good now as a general do you know there was a change in NC double a policy\nCoaches are going to have to deal with the fact that players skilled players\nA star players are being given leverage for the first time ever in college sports and so now if you're if you're not being used and you think you're a great quarterback you can leave now and start playing immediately right used to have to sit down for a\nYear for the next season yeah so like I said well okay I shouldn't say immediately you can't leave and weeks six and play a week seven but\nYou don't have to take a year off correct yeah I used to be that you would have to sit out the remainder of the season in the neck rising\nSo fields is what's considered I think the best quarterback in the country that's right and you know signs up on a team that had almost won the national championship with a quarterback who had just recently displaced at\nThat time the best high school quarterback in the country yeah Jake obesity so you have a situation now where\nFields has power we saw what happened at Clemson\nFields has power coaches are having to deal with this now but I think that this is going the wrong direction as a coach purpose smart is great I don't want anybody here thinking that I'm saying is not great but I I just\nThink that this is new this is new\nAnd you have to just still pick your quarterback\nYou're not going to keep both of these guys happy\nSo that neither of them walks away because even from could walk away if you want it to their there are there are he couldn't go to programs that field to go to but there are programs that would take him a ... from is only one year advanced from fields right it's not as if he's going to leave in a year and then it's the other guys team that's right you still have to choose\nYou have to choose which quarterback you want for the next couple of seasons doing you're always going to happen from head oh anytime I get fourteen points down I'm yanked that's not a good way to take the field\nAnd fields is never going to feel as if okay you know what I'll stay here because they use me forty percent of the time\nYou have to make the decision which one of these guys just the quarterback for the next two or three seasons you make that decision and you let the other quarterback decide what they want to do you have different things that happen in Alabama J what hurts decided to stay", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The
