WSBIU\nThank you bill forty seven degrees right now on peach tree street looking for an afternoon high up Seventy one with sunshine Kirk mellow she'll have Atlanta's most accurate and dependable forecast coming up the president and first lady will visit Pittsburgh today to grieve with the Pittsburgh community following the synagogue attack that government says there are so many victims it's impacting burial\nA week [noise] guess what you still get to vote your conscience guess what no one's taking that from you\nKnow it's weird now where people just don't seem to believe that there's ever a time for actual peaks\nAmongst the different divisions politically in this country I'm Glad your professors riled you up I'm Glad they got you interested in politics but they forgot something\nEvery once in a while just every once in a while you get off of your political high horse no matter what politics that horse represents and you simply show up and pay your respects\nSo less than needs to be learned by a lot of people in this country it's not political\nFor the president to go pay his respects and then the people who totally disagree with the president should be paying their respects everybody every once in a while there needs to be a politics free zone\nIt's so annoying to me lately who convinced is I'm convinced that social media I think social media is tearing up this country I think it's making people miserable\nWho convinced you that you have to let people know exactly what you think in every single damn situation you're in\nDiscretion as out the window commonsense is out the window\nReading the room taking the temperature of the room is out of the window because what you think politically is so damned important that\nYou have to put it on every tragedy\nThere is what an idiot Erich von ... is he blames the shooter what\nA simple minded adult everybody's looking for the bigger play\nWords made that happen ideas made that happen but we need to shut down more on word an idea factories so this doesn't happen\nI've got news for you it doesn't work that way you're stuck you're stuck in a free country\nWhere people are allowed to have their ideas you're stuck can you imagine this if you're twenty six or twenty seven year old years old you're actually stuck in a country where ... people who have ideas that you find a boring it the day you die they're still going to have the right to say those things that bother you so much\nYou're going to have to work it out man you're gonna have to figure it out how can you navigate that one way we do it is we have sort of political politics free zones every once in a while\nFunerals she'll be at the top of that list\nThe idea is the president shouldn't go pay his respects in Pittsburgh will be as if a if a loved one died and you're still going to hold it against one uncle who owed them twenty dollars he shouldn't come to the it's absurd you know this you know this in your own life\nBut there are times to step back and just to be respectful and what happened to that Marsha Blackburn\nOh yeah so she was she was having a rally and she was trying to offer a moment of silence that the victims in Pittsburgh\nBut then where resistance people there who have been taught that not only nature but you should have more of a fact that you jumping at every moment so who is it the thinks this will be a good idea I'll just drop all disrupt a minute of silence\nFor the victims in ... in Pittsburgh with my politics because again what I think politically is so\nDamned important that it must infuse every moment that\nAn alert listeners are\nWriting about it right on the lawn mowers resigned and knowing that I'm Sorry [laughter]\nAny more I don't anymore because that had to be done\nThis is how this generation has been taught off of the campuses centers before people don't understand what revolution is America had a revolution but it was a weird one where we we fought we won and then we started having our own we put together a country and the revolution ended but for most people revolution is a lifestyle\nAnd a revolution isn't any single worth talking about if it doesn't touch and infuse everything\nSo that young lady had to say she knows is much more important than any silly minute of silence from someone she disagrees with politically and by the way are just not for nothing is Marsha Blackburn a white supremacist\nI Believe that's out on her I said to us as well the lady said it was a lady you set it up and do we have emergency also strongly yeah she must be right right oh Republican\nI Would well that's the point right well that's the point right there all she might as well said all Republicans are white supremacist to truly get her idea across\nIt's a well rounded idea by the well certainly yes she certainly thought about it my question will be do you have pictures of her in a rally no no my professors taught me about dog whistles\nSo I don't have to have a picture of her at a rally I can simply deconstruct the things that she says in just like a recipe infused revolution\nAnd ...\nEvery one who's not me as a white supremacist and therefore must be held accountable it's just I mean that's that's somebody on the left plenty of nut jobs on the right shouting people down\nThe dumbing down this country I'll tell ya between that and lock her up ... where do you find that had to wear wear\nOn bravo that's where the autumn\nShe gets away from this by never watching the news and watches reality shows on bravo and I used to make fun of her [noise] but uh I'm beginning to understand it though given\nWhat I mean you were trying to find a little I think she wearing sports\nI was in that but now that's all political and all my teams keep losing pushes me hey tonight and they don't bravo below deck I'd I I uh I don't watch those\nShows you should I talked to John Bon Jovi talked me out so I spent a book coming to write a book offering [laughter] you know all the trees next door\nOr roughly five thousand two hundred American troops will be deployed on the southern border in response to that big migrate Caribbean it's pushing through Mexico let me just say it's not too caravans apparently\nI I I worry about this because it seems to me\nThat we don't exactly know what we're going to do with these troops I don't like the idea of moving troops anywhere without an absolute this is what they're going to do this is what they're not going to do everybody knows this is what I worry about I read some stories that say well they're probably be kind of behind the lines there'll be building things\nAnd editors ... brothers includes a engineering battalions with heavy equipment so they're they're scared that\nI worry well ... bucks that's controversial to say that they're there to scare them I I don't know once you what I don't know from the story is for instance will they have lived a rounds\nThis is what I have to find out because I don't worry about our troops but there could look people on the on the other side could place there are a lot of anarchist out there politically and you could play a couple of people to [noise]\nAgitate ... you know what if there's somebody on the other side with a gun you know what if they use that guns\nAnd what if they do that on purpose as a way to get one of our soldiers to respond and then we're in a world of hurt [noise]\nSo that's just well I I Would hope that they are exact plans I Do not want the military going down to the southern border and improvising has this
