week but the concerns and there's no one big concern in this market\nIt is it's a bunch of kind of these idiosyncratic things that are kind of holding things down\nAnd this week a perfect example Italy kind of in this budget battle with the EU China their their economy is slowing down their stock market you didn't even get hit significantly so they continue to be on the wrong end\nOf this trade fight which we've talked about here on money matters we at one point had any for battle trade World War with Canada and Mexico the emu and China one two three four\nFor the most part we've solved our differences on trade with Canada with Mexico with us MCI now that might not get voted on until the beginning of twenty Nineteen but there's there is some sort of agreement between the United states and those two countries were also at a effectively a trade standoff\nWhere both sides including the edu and the United states both wanting to get down to effectively zero tariffs and zero trade a oriented barriers those are all good news that's all good news on the trade front\nIf you think about that one two three of the four battles for the most part are kind of out of the woods we still have an issue with China we still have an issue with China and that can arguably has gotten worse and it may that may take a year or two are are are never get solved that is a very long term endeavor\nBut for the most part that continues to be the the right now the burden is on China as we see their stock market down twenty five plus percent and Arab and reports that are the the economic growth in China is slowing\n... again for the week though so far we continue to see earnings\nSeventy Seventy one percent of companies have been reported doing well or beating earnings expectations and yet here we are a market that is still in the ... in healing motive you really look where do we do this we even though a this huge update on Tuesday\nThe day I was only a point four of a percent for the week and they asked me five hundred was it was virtually flat on\nThe week so really no movement even though we had one really good day\nSo we're just we're just in this period of time where I feel as though when we get a really difficult stock market like we did a couple of weeks ago it's almost like a car accident\nAnd it just takes a lot of time to kind of her heal from that it doesn't just you don't just pop up and everything's fine the next day it's a healing process that takes time we've talked about how we think we're going into a strong cycle as we get it\nThe mid term elections regardless of who wins if you look back historically markets don't do a lot to the upside effectively kind of stay flat choppy up and down in these midterm election years where the exactly where we are today marks you'll do anything until we get fewer through\nThe mid term elections and that's not until the beginning of a November So we have a couple more weeks until we get to a period of seasonal strength that if you go back in history almost all the gains we see in years like this year in mid term election years\nThat they are all concentrated in the last two months of the year and we're just still not there yet we have to get through the uncertainty of where we go a politically\nOr to talk about historically and go back and look at ... to really major topics that they won\nHow how do markets he'll what happens after a huge sell off\nAnd what does that healing process look like which looks like we're kind of in the middle of that today but how long does it take markets to heal and then what happened after you get these massive sell off a month out three months out six months out in a year out so we can kind of understand for history how how markets react to\nWhat was what what was it was a significant amount of carnage\nA only a couple of weeks ago\nAnd then my thesis year all year has been that look this economy is continuing\nTo get stronger or we're one of the best economies we've seen in last really arguably since the financial crisis ended and we went through what we called the thirty nine miles per hour economy for\nThe better part almost a call it's six seven eight years where we grew\nUp but it's been this really shallow recovery where we were growing on average about one point nine percent a year so it really frustrated at the U.S here in the United states and that's part and and we saw this kind of after the financial crisis\nA significant slowing the a very slow recovery which is partially or ... maybe ... a significant portion of why we've seen so much political turmoil here in the United states\nAnd around the world populism comes back when the economy's just don't grow in the population gets frustrated\nWhen we haven't seen that this year we've seen real economic growth are really the last call it almost two years now\nAnd every time we talked about the stock market either fall back to well where are we going economically where we had it as an economy if the economy is strong that means earnings can be strong in the early ... can be strong that's a talent for the market west how can you be so sure\nHow do we know the economy's getting better because I hear that housing is slowing down and I hear that interest rates are going up but I hear the mortgage applications are soft\nWell how can you be so sure the economy's doing well it's not as simple as one economic variable you've gotta look at all the different pieces of data or sub cycles\nThat make up our US Economy\nAnd they don't all work in concert housing\nAnd autos and demographics it'll all work perfectly in unison they they they work on their own time clocks were we were you have to really do to understand how this economy is doing his lift up the hood and look at the let's call it ten to twelve major sub cycles of the economy if you count all those up\nAnd see on average where each cycle is then you can get a really good idea about where we're headed a where the whole train is headed and that's what I'm Talking about here today how are how are we so sure that this economy is good and knowing that are understanding all the sub cycles when we go back into recession\nBecause we know that the recession is really a true stock market killer\nWe go through economic growth markets still correct ten maybe twenty percent but usually that's it it's not until we go into an economic recession the markets get really really rough beyond the twenty percent mark twenty thirty thirty five percent corrections\nI don't think we're there yet we still have a lot of economic kale wind behind us but you gotta look at all those sub cycles to see where we go in order to do that today we had to go all through that so we've got an economic we've got market history we need to get to [noise]\nWe've got some of the sub cycles are really the inner workings of this economy to look at a so we can tell where we had it all

degrees on history\nOf it seems that cold so good morning welcome to the show or we'll go to the phones here so your calls questions for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty Greg in Norcross right what's going on how can I help\nOh sure I was telling your call screener I have a question about my mother's state my mother passed away the day after Thanksgiving last\nYear oh man I'm Sorry Greg now out here my old was your mom\nShe was eighty three eighty three okay right\nEighty three and we saw the only thing we had two of her state was the whole the whole was paid for and I need that cater to the state\nAnd we sold the whole just I think this past that same couple of months ago and I'm curious is that a the proceeds from that when I first and to myself and my siblings are those going to be taxable\n[noise] okay so the answer here would be the way here's the way this works is that when you inherit a piece of property like this the the basis you inherit the new basis so regardless of what your mom ... own the house for let's say she bought it for fifty thousand you inherited it and it was worth two hundred\nOr two hundred is underneath the gift the they're not getting the estate tax exclusion which which is certainly certainly is\nA which has gone up to five point six million dollars per person now so it's a massive massive number the yes the how you're going to again you're going to ... that two hundred that you just inherited in value is total there's no tax all not at all the the only the only question is that when\nWhen you sell that capital last that let's say like a house or what is what is the value of it when you sell it to you inherited it's worth two hundred and then you sell it and it's worth three hundred\nThen you do have to worry about the gains from when you inherited the tax or when you inherited the asset now on a piece of property like this automatically you qualify for a long term gates or long term capital gains [noise] so it's really the difference between the value of when you inhale\nThe actor and then what you sold it for but it also qualify for long term capital K which remember that's a little bit more of a complicated tax\nQuestion because the pet depends on your particular bracket what your capital gains rate is it could be zero could be Fifteen Percent could be twenty points three percent but\nTypically the scenario like this it sounds like me are the very most you might have been a little a little capital gains tax on what the difference between what you inherited the asset of what you sold for\nGreg

questions today and I'm One that we still have yet to answer and we're about to do that right now has to do with ... really recession ... where are we in this economic expansion how long does that last how long does\nIt continue on where do we go from here we've been using a football analogy because they're in middle it's fall it feels like fall finally we're finally in the middle of\nFootball season so where are we well if I had to give this a time and the game it's probably mid middle of the third quarter\nWhen on the fourth quarter not two minute warning we\nGot we got some real time left in this game when it comes to economic expansion remember we talked about before the break expansions economics majors don't just stop or die they die of some sort of imbalance massive imbalances that then get corrected and that's when we're sessions really happen\nSo where where are we and what does this look like in real time what looks like\nAnd you've heard as well probably in twenty Nineteen we go into recession I don't I don't know if I Believe that the consensus says we're going into recession\nNext year because it's already been this long expansion ... to me doesn't look back that does it look like twenty Nineteen doesn't look like next year it's almost twenty Nineteen by the way it looks like beyond even twenty twenty twenty twenty or beyond\nOr maybe even later maybe between Twenty one so here a couple of the points and and why was number one this is the second longest expansion economically again we're not talking about the stock market in talking to the ... the economic expansion was the second longest expansion time wise\nGoing back to ... ... post World war two\nBut it's far from the strongest recovery that we've had that argues the results that reason I bring this up as it argues that we have additional time left\nIn the game you go back and you look at how much\nHow much we grew beyond where we started to how much new GDP was created host the prior recession you go back to Nineteen forty nine ah expansion to Nineteen fifty three we saw in almost thirty percent gaining new GDP\nIf you go back and look in Nineteen eighty two Nineteen Ninety that long expansion we had a thirty eight percent new GDP created and we by the way growing it on an average a four point three percent\nEconomic growth or GDP percentage economic growth on average Nineteen Ninety One to two thousand and one we grew forty two percent of new GDP we grew it over three and a half percent\nWell the expansion that we've had since two thousand and nine two Jews two dozen a nine until effectively where we are today it's been kind of a mediocre expansion we've gained about twenty two percent in New GDP\nCertainly well below the examples that I just cited and its ... we've averaged to point to to to point three percent growth relative to the average expansion has grown at a four point six percent\nClip so this expansion is kind of like half its really almost like a half\nFeet\nPart of the reason we we used for so long this thirty nine miles per hour economy if you're used to driving at sixty miles an hour and you're forced to slow down to thirty nine\nAnd now drive on the highway for the next hundred miles at thirty nine miles per hour that's effectively what the difference here has been relative to what we're used to I'm used to drive in sixty used to drive in three\nThree and a half percent economic growth per year and then you and you come down to one point nine or two percent of its like slow it down to less than forty miles an hour it's frustrating\n... that is where we have been in jail this past year now we're we're back to kind of growing again it's sixty miles an hour maybe even a little more than that because we are growing at three and a half percent plus GDP at least we are right now\nSo if you look at the ten or twelve sub cycles and you have you've got to look at them both objectively and subjective all you've got to look at the numbers and you also have to say well OK here's where we think we are in\nEach one of these cycles it's again it's not ... makes his or is that exactly black and white where we are each sub cycle I'm going to go through these autos housing different examples they don't move in perfect predictable patterns\nSo of course it requires looking at the totality of all these areas\n[noise] number three imbalances where are they that's the that's kind of the economic killer that typically ... creeps up and then brings us back into recession where the imbalances\nOr if you look at each one of the sub cycles they there are the right now arguably there are no massive imbalances or areas of real excess", "show_name": "The Herman Cain Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day":
