[laughter] here this morning and I can't believe\nIt's just ... two years ago maybe we would have been surprised at the ... the United states call somebody horse face but I Walk in this morning and someone who left CNN on the monitor no there was ten twelve minute round table on the president tweeting than a porn star has a horse\nFace CNN you were ... I saw the idea of news is something different news but you would never leave the news with the sun rose today\nBecause it's not different you will lead the news with for some reason the son didn't rise today so I it's almost ... to me [noise]\nAnd that's not a sexual turn by the way when I saw that to realize that oh\nThis is just good for ratings CNN\nThe loves Donald Trump CNN knows that the word horse face two years into this administration after the primary and the general election is not news\nBut they woke up I saw horse face they said thank you Mr President now we can get all the self righteous people in here who can a\nVirtue signal all over the place and let people know how much better they are and the president because they would never say such a thing about a porn star who's making fun of the president's junk in a book [laughter] you know so there's more going on here uh apparently and I didn't notice this but I saw a story about this last night\nSarah Huckabee Sanders is only given one press conference in the last uh I don't know three weeks or something Donald Trump made the decision that going into the midterms\nHe was going to be his own spokesperson and that's why you've seen so much of him gave that a couple of weeks ago he gave the hour and a half almost press conference that's right he's been he's been answering questions every time he leaves the White House to walk to get on the uh to get on the helicopter\nAh he's bent on every Fox News show [laughter] at this point on Fox News when somebody says they have an exclusive with the president it's laughable\nFox News Fox Business he's been giving all kinds of interviews and then back to the inappropriate tweeting\nI think she's decided I'm going to I'm going to handle I handle all PR\nFor this administration and part of that is every once in a while he's going to call somebody an ugly name now the question well why would he say that now ... why would he call her horse face in reality the main issue the main case still hasn't been settled\nThe main case about her that she has against and the reason is because he wants to hurt her\nHe wants to he wanted to hurt her feelings she gave him all kinds of trouble and the way you hurt somebody's feelings is you make fun of their physical appearance\nYou can go after somebody's politics you can go after the way they do things everyone can rationalize\nThat to themselves and Stormy Daniels Ken in public say oh how below the presidency but in private when the lights are out in the infrequent periods of time that she's alone\nWill bother because it bothers all of us anytime somebody goes after our physical appearance no matter what we say on the outside on the inside it bothers us and the president knows he can't sue her whatever so his way to hurt her for hurting him\nIs to go really deep and hurt her feelings 'cause horse face hurts if you're faceless anything like a horror [laughter]\nBecause we got around to face that looks nothing like a horse it doesn't hurt\nDid you think our response or got him back pretty well are now what was the response she said a ladies and gentlemen may present your guys did in ... and it seemed to his um shortcomings right\nBut that's fine that's fine but you know when I Know the reality it hurts her feelings she makes her living off of her physical appearance the whole now she's aging that happens all porn stars but what she's been known for is her physical appearance that's her currency\nAnd so for him to come out and call her horse face that's why he did it he knew that that was the way to hurt her at the deepest level\nI knew last night she'd had a hard time going to sleep when she hit the hey [laughter]\nI'm not allowed allowed the parodies but the word play I

the occasional twenty four year old female activist hey but did you see that women can drive as long as their husbands brothers and fathers give them permission\nCould it be the father doing it and him not knowing don't buy into this not knowing thing okay the question I\nHow we're probably what's going to happen to be honest with you on the west is going to jump on board with that story so that we can move on and still do the things with Iran that we want to do and geopolitically life is hard I'm Sorry to tell you this maybe that's the best thing for the country to do but we don't have to buy into it\nSometimes you just do it's called dirty work it exist for a reason\nAnd it may be that we just have to do some dirty work here\nBut there's no need to jump in there that don't look for aside and this\nIs this the the king and the parents are both ...\nAnd I think don't lose sight of that just because you have to work with some s obese because geopolitically your allies against Iran and that's just a reality but just understand it do it with your eyes wide open this nonsense you know you know what I Would say if it's some other part of the royal family\nLet's see let's see the trial let's see the investigation and Saudi Arabia let's see the people who did it\nUh put up on trial let's see them be found guilty and let's see them get their heads cut off I'm not for cutting off their heads but as long as it's uh\nStreet where you're cut the head off twenty four year old girl because she asked\nQuestions men if the plants and the king really didn't know about this and these were rose operatives let's see the trial and let's see the punishment that's not going to happen because the king and the print smell they sent these people\nTo Istanbul to murder this guy and for some reason they thought no one would care I don't understand that part of it they just start knowing we care who you Lindsay\nGraham agrees with your assessment this guy's got to go on I'm In their biggest offender on the floor of the United States Senate disguise I wrecking ball\nHe had just gotten murdered and that conflict and turkey and expect me to ignore it or feel used and abused I was on

[laughter] I just I ...\nI just love the idea that they're they're totally to cop to uh we accidentally killed him [laughter]\n[laughter] how do you accidentally kill somebody who by the way went to the consulate to fill out paperwork so he could get married\nShowed up in one piece and left and many others say we don't know how many pieces of how many different suitcases that guy left the consulate in\nI haven't I I kind of agree with Lindsey Graham but also going back to the whole dirty work thing this is what you need to know the answer Dr ... give you the bottom line in a few weeks\nWe're going to put the real final nail squeezed on Iran by forcing their oil off the market I think that's about two million barrels a day somewhere in there at one point six and we need the Saudis to make up for that so that\nOur prices do go about four dollars a gallon that's what's really going on here\nI mean the military stuff yes and the contracts yes a little bit we could walk away from one or two contracts we can't walk away from our strategy with Iran and we need them for that now let me ask you a question I think for that reason maybe that's why they thought we would just look the other way\nAnd my question is can oil can Iran sell their oil for goal to China and Russia who probably won't go along with the sanctions\nWill no they're not going the sanctions but they're they're going to try to figure out ways to to uh to sell their oil but by buying their oil\nThe United states then takes the sanctions and puts them on you oh this is why uh this is why the European Union although they talk about not leading the Iranian nuclear deal and trying to work things out they can't work anything out because\nIt's there is no individual country that has a better ... has a better future by choosing to deal\nEconomically with Iran and not the United states and that's going to be the proposition on the world stage just what it is already with an oil we added in so you buy their oil then you can't you know we don't deal with you anymore\nAnd individually there's a lot of the European Union talks of big game but France is not going to choose to deal or to trade with Iran over America and neither is Germany or any other individual states so we've\nGot um we've got um rubber we want him but we need Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a horrible disgusting awful government and we happened to have\nThe same interest when it comes to the middle east and Iran and that's our big or strategy but it's dirty work dirty work needs to be done but don't you my dear listener buy\nInto
