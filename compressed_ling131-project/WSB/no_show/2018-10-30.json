this story and\nYou know we have talk radio we have twenty four hour news things we have to fill things up I'm sure today you'll see a couple of round tables till the pundits on twenty four hour news and some people see this is just that Donald Trump you see what's going on now running this they're preparing for war what's this headline is and this is a good thing\nThe headline here is a test for you dear listener maybe you're younger\nOr maybe even older and you just haven't learned your lesson yet but if you're somebody who is uh just getting turned down to the world of politics current events you're just starting to care this is a test\nAs to whether or not\nYou actually know what you're talking about and this is how it works if you read the headline like this and you take it seriously at all\nYou do not know what you're talking about you haven't been around politics long enough\nTo have to have any sort of context if you if you see this and you already hate Trump bright so it's all you see what he's doing in the world I mean Russia says they're preparing for war this hasn't happened since the Cold War it's this Donald Trump\nRemoving himself from this treaty that by the way I never read them but you know USA Today oh tell me what the treaty was\nWhat if if you believe if you take that headline seriously at all what it means is you're not you're not you're not a thinker yet you're still upon you're somebody who's still moved around the board by the powers that be on all sides\nRussia says this because that's what you say in a situation where you've been caught cheating this treaty was dead\nDuring the Obama administration Obama even said they're cheating but they made a decision there's a there's an idea in a in diplomacy the says well better to keep them at the table we know they're cheating but at least maybe now we can monitor that whatever Donald Trump was was elected to be a bullet a China shop\nAnd to call the baby ugly and all that so you have two different styles one says they instilled try to talk to him and work with them but Obama said they're cheating Trump says they're cheating and he says that well that means the deal is dead\nLet's move on let's do something else it's also a good it's a good idea to pull out of this treaty because it had just run its course in history it was a treaty between the United states and Russia but we have other entities now North Korea China\nThey're not signatories to this\nSo they so that they're not limited on the long range missiles so you went up in a situation where even if this treaty was being enforced properly it would allow other countries who didn't signed a treaty to get ahead of you militarily\nI'm all for treaties I'm I'm for treaties that work especially when it comes to nukes and deliverable ... these are deliverable these missiles are but if it's not working is not working but\nThe most important thing for you dear listener if you see a headline like this and you take it seriously at all you still have a lot to learn about politics and that's a good thing\nExcuse me police me ...

[laughter] I\nThought that pin tourist is one of those online things where they made sure there was a four and a half from what I knew that apple does that mean there's no pornography and the apple store\nNo with their hands on later short Twitter for some reason does not censor any nudity really yeah that's bizarre because Facebook does Instagram does all the major ones\nLately I think that she might ... who's the clean up then [laughter]\nWhat do you have any part of my resonate [laughter] can I tell\nYou that was linked in ...

[laughter]\nOne time I looked out there to set the people's gradually be for promotion and I wasn't even aware that I got one [laughter] so I guess linked it is a is good for that I suppose [laughter] All right\nThe great Jamie ... just put out an awesome blog post talking about President Trump's latest Decorah declaration suggesting that his administration can end up birthright citizenship and the United states via executive order\nHe'd never would Republicans ah mocked executive orders oh how the times have changed yet have been said he was going to do it though do you think about it but he said in this ... interview that\nWe always thought it was you had to change the constitution and now he has lawyers telling him that he doesn't have to change the constitution\nA fourteenth amendment I mean here it is or you can\nYou can uh take this any way you like I suppose it seems pretty plain to me all persons born and there's that dreaded word\nRight he wants to get rid of the thing where you're you're an illegal immigrant you cross over the United states uh your nine months pregnant you have a baby the baby is an American citizen and therefore you can stay\nRight I'm not saying that's not a problem ... baby I'm saying right he's talking about colloquially known as anchor babies oh goodness\nWell helped on women didn't hear that always go off for a ... right now\nAll persons born this is the fourteenth amendment all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and other state where and they reside\nSo I don't know who these lawyers are there are telling Trump that he could change this with an executive order and again let's back up and remember when Republicans were mocking\nLeading by executive order a so I think it comes down to\nI guess this is really\nA mid term election\nJust rhetorical flare because he cannot and even if he could remember come on Republicans let's go back a few years remember why you were mocking executive orders\nCause the next president can come in and write an executive order and suddenly that change that you thought you made isn't really change what's governance what's important feeling good in the moment are actually making change the last\nTen years Fifteen Years Twenty years down the line you have to ask yourself that question to makes you feel better that the president writes an executive order that is going to be a bally hoos about and go up to the Supreme Court and get knocked down and get everybody all excited if that's what you want out of your politics that's what you can have but what's gonna happen\nBecause in America hate to break it to you the other party wins\nYour party wins the other party wins everybody declares is the end of time and it turns out it isn't the other party comes back in and any change\nThat you made with his accurate border\nOn the other party some powder is in power is when you realize oh we didn't change anything\nWe just had a vitriolic moment where we all felt good inside but now that's gone and it has no legs looking all the stuff that Obama did through executive order none of it sticks Obamacare on the other hand pretty difficult to remove why\nLegislation it was enacted into law\nYou want to make changes and you want them to be there after your empower because here's the news you might not realize your party will not be in power forever it's just the United states of America it doesn't work that way so while you're in there if you want to make change that sticks around\nYou better do it legislatively you do it to executive orders it's not going to work even if it's constitutional and I just read the fourteenth amendment to you I'm not a lawyer [laughter] I'm not a constitutional scholar Brock I Know you are\n[laughter] you got to take them all as there are written well except for the second\nHigh that when you're going to ignore\nThose everybody has the uh particular amendments they like and don't like so that appears to me that there's nothing you can do about this unless you were going to amend the constitution\nOr do you think he's just being rhetorical because of the election election yeah\nSo I think he believes that the uh the caravan thing as a gift and he wants to use it all all that he can he might be right look he knows he has these people who will vote for him but if they sit on their behinds on election day don't go out to the polls it doesn't do you any good to have a bunch of people who like you don't vote so it got tossed some red meat\nUsually when you hear about the president tossing red meat on CNN or something it's it's not really uh it's it's kind of unfair because everybody's tossing red meat around right but this one really would qualify for that since everyone should know it's not possible to change this was an executive order the constitution doesn't work that way\nI don't have you on the left are you on the right listen up you're stuck with the parts of the constitution you don't like to bad next story\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway is husband George got away encouraged what a Twitter users are describing is a pile on attack over President Trump's attacks on the media so obviously George is a big liberal Kelly and as a as a conservative then goes on and that's I that's a sign of change really\nI I Would doubt you on that I don't I've never seen this George Conway but I wouldn't think he's a big liberal but he was probably a Republican was in the never Trump camp treasury enough strangely enough to have Kellyanne Conway is his wife out do you know not singlehandedly but she never got the credit she deserved for Trump actually winning\nThe election because she's a Republican woman and that doesn't count you can't celebrate Republican women\nDo though is [laughter] it would've been a Democrat or a lame yeah they're against the U.S yeah exactly\nYou can't celebrate that at all so that must be a it reminds me a little bit of like a member a who's the guy who was the who was the a campaign chairman for Clinton got like a lizard\nDick Morris know they've got like a lizard and now you doubt amassed James Carville and he married Madeleine ...\nShe was she was George H W Bush's campaign a director or whatever so ran the campaign and those two got Mary
