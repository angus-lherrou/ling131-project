what are you saying yeah a little bit what I'd light was run defense allowing sixty six yards to Tennessee tendencies not very good nor do pretty well snuff that out\nJust infield the quarterback look terrific when he was and they got in there more than that in the flow of the game hadn't run a lot more read option place he looked great Brian hearing was the clothes are running back came in and had six seven great carries on my final Dr finish things off what I didn't like\nSeeing the office of law and give up for a Second Amendment wasn't that was a little ... tendencies ... pass Russia's not at Alabama level certainly so no matter who you just known for being a dumpster fire but is that in one area that the bill defensive line is that one area that they are known to be\nHalfway decent inner not not like that and I gather that surprised we came off as a little flat and that era I wanted to see the run game dominate better they they're only averaging four and a half your to carry
