a lot but we got we got almost two million people in the state so there's ten people for every day or at least a ...\nAnd we're a big state where the biggest state is the Mississippi and I will not when you multiply that out across were you know on average across the state that's a somewhere between twenty and thirty deer per square mile\nOkay how many hunters are out there this morning and how many well better that that question and then to how many deer owners will we have over the season\nWell over the course of the season will have about three hundred and fifty thousand deer hunters and
