who's inducted hill or what it means that they're following us in that were relatively one should be as I end up getting care it would be a poor signal so we welcome the controversy and we welcome the dialogue or\nA welcome any of it I'll tell you this I don't have any problem with a rock and roll museums love to go somewhere and see the original sergeant peppers outfits and whatnot\nBut the idea of a hall of fame for rock and roll it gives you an excuse to go to Cleveland stupid oh hey who needs an excuse to go to Cleveland [laughter] the Alan's asked me who nominees are\nWell I've got Stevie

this drum all day yes I definitely had run the grand Roger ... okay gotta ... death left or the rocky music or John Prine in a ...\nI see to me it doesn't even really matters the concept of a it's not like if you are the best pitcher in America is the best baseball pitcher in America and you're from the smallest town in America\nThe major leagues will find you your talent will be found\nYou'll start pitching is illegal unit here in small towns the word but get out scouts will come and find you you'll end up on a major league team you'll have a career and then people will decide based on your stats whether you belong in a legitimate hall of fame like the baseball hall of fame here's the problem with music\nThere is a good possibility that I've never heard the best rock and roll band of all time because maybe they only we're together from Nineteen sixty seven to Nineteen Seventy one and they never really got passed a\nMinneapolis Saint Paul area see what I'm saying that it's possible that most of us have never heard the best rock band\nHowever is not possible that if you the best baseball pitcher in America but you're not going to be found so sports hall of fame makes sense but music is subjective and so what's happening since we're not making any more big rock and roll bands is over time\nEveryone's going to get in and then you just expand what rock and roll means so you bring in rapid he bringing Madonna and the whole thing is ridiculous but then again\nWhat do I care why am I spending the first twelve minutes of my show on this I don't give a damn give me some real new\nAlright big story here today is the last eight to register to vote here in Georgia for the mid term elections like Stacey Abrams area like Brian given the editorial racy got registered today\nI got to choose between ah the guy who points a gun at a teenager\nThat's one ad tells me and then I got a ... or the lady who apparently ran for governor just so we could have more pedophilia around [laughter] I mean I I hear that uh that cap is not doing very well\nAnd uh I'm I've got to wonder if it's because of two things won his primary campaign may have just been too weird for people in in general and uh then I just think that the opening salvo of\nEven even if you don't believe in Stacey Abrams a programs ideas I don't I'm not a liberal I don't believe in those kind of socialistic\nThings you know our people really got to buy the idea that she's a she's a fan of ah\nPedophilia that seems like I I just don't think that's you know I don't think it's going to land with people and so I think he comes off as a you know bit of a goofball\nWell not to not to mention too when I I've seen a lot of people with Instagram post 'cause obviously he's doing his state wide tour and so people don't get pictures with them and putting\nThat I saw him at the UGA game yeah so in Tempe took a picture of them too and there's something I Know appearances shouldn't be a factor but he's the only in a weird smile yeah which ... says yeah strange like it's like it's not ... but it's a nice a smile a little more ... there is also true his his smile seems insincere\nThat doesn't mean that it's in some said he just has a smiley a great guy\nBut uh the smile seems insincere but I look I Know that states like Georgia are certainly bluer than they used to be but they're still read it's not time for a a Stacey Abrams to beat\nA a a a Republican and a state of Georgia and if it happens now you got to lay it soundly on the camp camp\nOr because what's gonna happen is\nIf he loses it means people just didn't get excited about him and they didn't get off the couch and they didn't go out\nAnd so it seems like what's happening right now a little bit that I don't sense a whole lot of excitement\nAmongst Republicans about Brian Kemp to get like four weeks left to start something up but I Would say here's a good idea I'd heard Elizabeth Warren is coming into town to uh give a speech for Stacey Abrams alright get rid of the ridiculous pedophilia nonsense which isn't true and nobody's buying\nAnd just\nTake clips from Elizabeth Warren's saying how much she loves Stacey Abrams and put that in your ads I mean this this is not difficult uh but\nThey don't seem to be it's not a very well run campaign you know doing a great job in the primary uh means zero in the

happen here is the way that this works is kind of scare the hell out of a twelve year old and hope that the kid that that you know the old scared straight thing you want to make an impression on a twelve year old so maybe they stop disrespecting law enforcement and\nStop doing things that they've been warned not to do my understanding is the kid was given to warnings about the same behavior\nThat was an important behavior know selling CDs of Cumberland Mall but if you pay the rent on the stores that are in Cumberland Mall you don't especially appreciate the idea that people can come along sell their goods and not paying the rent\nThat's the real world is going on here I get so annoyed well as a white cop and it's a twelve year old kid\nBut the twelve year old kid is not respecting the top the twelve year old kid is just you know completely just giving every signals that if you let go of me I'm Out of here so go ahead and play with just a shorter version\nThat'd be the ants that's the ... ... there's nothing everything here comes from her from what I can see well she's definitely setting the tone somewhat more than a tone and at one point the ... the kids saying you know you you you don't have the right to do this is the way it worse people\nThis is the way it works whether you're white black green red I don't care I don't know why people always say Greenville yeah [laughter] so I was everything in your green\nSee your doctor when the cops show up the cops are in charge\nYou treat them with respect\nAnd if they treat you poorly while you're treating them with respect you take that up at the next level whether it's the courtroom or whether it's a superior back at the headquarters\nBut on the spot jobs will tell you the way that it is it doesn't matter what you think of this and what your opinion is on the spot when the cops show up the cops are in charge\nUncle bill is no longer in charge of the house party that got out of hand when the cop show up the cops are in charge you treat them with respect\nAnd if they mistreat you while you're treating them with respect you fight that fight at a later time\nThat's just good common sense\nHow long have you know world now where it's twelve year old is not even in the slightest bit\nFlown mentally when dealing with like he's just immediately in the cops face telling them you can't do this and I got my rights but when you don't have the right to sell CDs that come to the mall you don't have that right\nRight can I tell you what she said in the article I read a quote that she had said why is that um she said she knows selling these selling CDs there might be illegal and by well what he was dealing with nothing immoral or unethical\nOh so this is my [laughter] what whatever her name is yeah she looks at the laws of the land whichever one she agrees with\nThose are the ones that she agrees that he's the only thing I regret not something unethical\nIt's funny when I was what I Would say to her is well the cops are are are there are the legal people they're they're they're the people who get along when you're breaking the law they're not the ethics police\nAre them to like hide and run [laughter] it's like yeah I'm doing it you can't find the enemy or even more disrespectful\nThere's it's it's sort of annoys me a little bit with our coverage to always with the pointing out of the white cop\nAnd the ... the race has nothing to do with this I I I've got news for the I got news for the news [laughter]\nThere is no bargain between between police and white people were white people are allowed to do whatever the hell they want when cops show I mean it's the same for everybody\nAll right the cops are here if you have time to flush that stuff down the toilet go ahead [laughter] we're going to go to finance but the cops are in charge\nThis is the way that it works\nThis is what people understood for a very long time when I saw that this was viral and it was a racial issue and it was local and I thought oh no and I I thought it was going to go there and the cops going to have a twelve year old on the ground punching him or something is\nNo there is nothing nothing ... even slightly\n... with what the cop is doing and the race of the top and the kid and the aunt has nothing to do with this\nCops are a target\nLike when a cop walks into a situation unlike you the cop has to worry three sixty all the way around it for what somebody's going to do so the important thing for a cop is control the situation\nNow if a cop abuses you then you have your day in court but if you the moment the cop shows up you started yelling at the ... yeah we can do whatever\nWe want it's not the way that it works in the\nMedia is all you know it's a it's first of all it's viral so that makes it news who decided that and certainly oh it's a white got white cop black child have nothing to do with the rubber Taj this'll this'll let's put that all young people stop there\nThere's nothing to see here\nExcept the twelve year old who needs to learn but he can't sell their CDs ... she wants to\nNot in this city not in any other city it doesn't work that way and by the way twelve years the age that you should learn things we don't expect twelve year olds to know everything\nSo I'm not condemning somebody who's twelve years old who acts will accept that does what but that adults have to step in and go oh a twelve year old\nThere are limits there are plenty amateurs we're adults nothing wrong with a twelve year old learning what what the limits are but the audience what what is she had\nTo fall back on I decided this isn't a law that this twelve year old has to abide by where did you get that authority\nColin Kaepernick [laughter] it's already come from\nIt really is she just thinks well he's not doing something that's hurting anyone right so she feels like she he should be allowed to do it or just be given another slap on the wrist right\nForever well I mean you know a use hurting someone not physically but if you like I said if you pay rent to sell your where's that cover mall\nYeah those useful in the middle that are trying to give you a ... I Believe me\nThey're annoying yeah but they belong there because they paid to be there so you have to you can't just show up and start doing bootleg\nStuff even if your mix tapes fire [laughter] hey you know if your mix tapes fire\nI Would go a downtown uh ... down there by a a ... where's\nThat there's a one area by Georgia State where I see a guy and he's selling socks on the side of the road
