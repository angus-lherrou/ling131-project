income taxes meaning a greater share of the money that they make so a a percentage of the money they take in the top one percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes\nThen the bottom Ninety percent combined\nStill not enough sir not at all [laughter] we need to go after these are these people that fall into the thirty to forty percent making about two fifty to about six hundred thousand have that give it to the government\nThe top fifty percent of all taxpayers paid Ninety seven percent of total individual income taxes I Would say people are paying their fair share that would be my point of view\nThey're paying more than their fair share you would say that I wouldn't say that I was I'd rather take a ten Fifteen twenty percent of that money and pilot back into the private economy as opposed to going up there for some boondoggle plan that some professor at UGA decided cooked up in his mind one night that would to equal the or do something about the income gap\nAnd these people

was actually talking about the field\nI got to be a little confused at home is typical but soccer but there is a there is outrage in the baseball playoffs there's apparently some weird stuff going

the area near the red Sox got during the ale championship series opener\nWhen it doesn't matter MLD said as well to do it yeah uh now last night was you were watching the game the red zone yeah and you say that that should have\nBeen a home run they went over the oil I mean the fact that there is there any rule\nThat says if fans interfere yeah then it's an out that's the rule now if you look at it in slow motion maybe he closes the glove a little bit before the hand gets there but it doesn't matter the fact the sand\nGet short all in touch with you a glove I think touches off the rule right and their manners defense touched the player the gloves oil yeah the the thing is if you put it in super slow motion it looks like he closed the glove and the ball bounced off of that before\nThe fans hand actually it it but the fan is involved and it doesn't happen in super slow motion\nThey must have changed that rule because I always thought it was if it went over the fence it was a home run no matter what\nUh no that's just this is this is something that looked like maybe he could have caught it at the Bartman are not as bad as Bartman because if you look at this one in slow motion he does appear to close the glove and before the fan hits him but he could still be in reaction to somebody being there\nYou know even even that doesn't happen I think there are a member of about a replay as the the the actual play doesn't happen in slow motion and we all start looking at it as if it's super slow noting hit the ball it was you know was Houston\nOh and even even I Would say was the right even the Houston coach said there's there was a law again to be played at that point manager\nOh sorry the baseball manager cut you off I understand that all the others are called the third base coach

opposite I think I always have to keep pointing that out because sometimes in radio land you got to take the people by the hand and\nJust leave them in a long history that they'll get last autumn most of my ... my radio builder or yeah or not smart she tells me all the time he says the ... they are showed up and I'm not going to play the game that way I I respect mile\nOr you just start Bambi here

with it I think it's the Eighteenth I'm going to go with it\nI'm looking at the date sometimes but I get nervous that I'm afraid I'm going to say the wrong I Know that in my own head I pick that up and down there but\nIt's the same thing with people's named assist radio the worst thing that happens is they fire you\nDon't take you out and shoot in the back of the head or anything you want to make it as a lark because your husband's the breadwinner and that's where your husband's an astronaut\nYou'll be fine if you move to Atlanta I print out a handy show sheet with the way I look at that now that I can do to I'm doing I sold my nothing to do a lot [laughter] we need to question a place called\n... have you gone on to Maryland to Atlanta and parks in the Senate I give me some old Joe\nBiden is in the headlines again Joe ... he was on CBS this morning and he made news by saying this\nDemocrats when the house ... new form of articles I Hope they don't\nI don't think there's a base for new and\nI think we should wait until the report comes out\nI Can't say that our president [laughter] craft\nHe's being he's being smart I don't know if it's going to work out but I get where he's going there he's trying to be the reasonable Democrat let me check Twitter dumped capital\nWell yeah but you but here's the problem with that crowd we've talked about this before this primary you think a bunch of Republican how many Republicans were last on Seventeen\nOr so I think so yeah it's an area to table I heard they might start out at\nAlmost thirty now I don't I don't know if that's true or not but it's going to be north of Eighteen a lot of candidates and just for\nReally on the top of my head as far as the socialist far less goes right Bernie Sanders Kamala Harris\nA book or Cory Booker and\nUh who else is there was another one out there it was the porn yeah of course so they they are gonna cannibal eyes one another so long as they all stay in the primary long enough\nAnd each have enough money they could split up that vote so much that if someone appears to be somewhat reasonable and centrist like Joe Biden or I think that guy from Starbucks Howard Schultz is going to jump in same kinda thing business friendly but socially liberal kind of thing\nOr you might be able to get to the primary that way but if the other if those for others and they'll be more than that even I mean let's not forget ... going to be in this thing there's no doubt about that Michael is really going to do he's running oh no doubt about a man he's running and nobody knows what that's going to do\nSo you add that to the mix you know being somebody who appears to be reasonable might actually get you through the primary if these other ones are splitting up to vote and cannibalizing each other so much so this is the beginning of his way of running for president\nBut if the Democrats are smart wouldn't they encourage some people not to run because our ... our final Hillary's not running this time so they can't because yeah you can pay yeah but arguably though when the Republicans were running a in the last election Trump and are in ... I'm not certain that Trump Rubio and Cruz\nTook ... did they kind of had the same voter base and it'll Trump the kind of know that you know here's the\nThing nobody nobody cares Michael ...
