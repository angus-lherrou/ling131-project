you 'cause he grew up in a very loving family\nBecause people are coming up and there's this there's this ... involved as if I oh these people something and\nYou can't oh people something unless you're somehow responsible\nFor their situation so philosophically the underpinning here is\nWell it's really United state's fault that all these countries in South or actually there from Guatemala originally it's right south of the border all these countries south of the border are uh are in trouble you'd have to believe that right the United states will have to be responsible for that in order for\nThese people to be so belligerent as they come towards the United states this group of folks from Honduras NATO Honduras so if ah\nI as a libertarian I Am very open to the idea that someone wants to be an American\nAs they marched toward us who's giving them advice if you want somebody to think how about march with American flags how 'bout singing the star Spangled Banner as you walk towards the United states but they're they're coming here\nWith the attitude of a far left Democrat suspicious of\nThe United states\nOr are you going to be are you going to be bigoted and turned me away it seems to me if you want people to let you in you would tell them what a nice lawn they have boys ... boy what a great great place this is\nAnd where we're coming from I think a lot of Americans doesn't mean we could accommodate everybody but there's something about this is just completely ginned up and now there's this belligerence\nThe president of the United states is not going to stop us from going to the United states well it turns out\nHe does actually have the power to do that and we're getting into a really weird standoff here because Trump's talking about putting the military on the border don't listen that's fine and dandy until someone get shot\nAnd then the story goes into a whole different situation\nAnd I've got to wonder if there are aren't elements in the United states who are encouraging this who have their fingers crossed that some I'm not going to say they want people to die but there's some sort of Kent State like skirmish goes down\nAnd they believe that the president will not be able to survive that\nAs long as there's no shooting and they show up in the military and they don't go any further that's fine but then what happens because there seems to be a lot of anger with this group\nAnd even though they're leaving their home country which is you know not I hate to say it this way I Would ask people which you refer to Honduras as an asshole country\nBecause that's your behavior\nYou're saying you want to leave the place that you were born but your entire family lives in so I have to assume that you would refer to Honduras your home country as an asshole country\nBecause you don't want to stay there\nBut you want to come to the United states but you're coming with a ... around your coming with a clenched militants fist\nWhy would people feel welcoming\nIt doesn't make any sense the far left tells us this country is is horrible but we have to let everybody in Honduras doesn't have a problem with everybody wanted to get him because it is horrible\nIt's a terrible place to live so right in front of you the facts say everyone around the world is trying to get into this place but the far left is telling us it's horrible\nMy challenge is always the same [noise] tell me the last time you saw a news story where a boatload of Americans crashed on some other country shore and asked to be allowed in oh wait a minute never\nSo if you live in the country where people stay and other people want to get into and the far left to agitate to let more people in once you have to admit that's a pretty great country\nYou go to the far left to say why would you even encourage people to come to this country if you hate it so much if it's nothing but bigotry and massage Jimmy and sexism why the hell would you encourage people to come here\nOh because it's better here than there but don't hold them asshole countries\nSomebody is behind this I don't know what what elements in the United states are behind this but they're trying to set up this is all perfectly set up for the midterms\nBy the time they get through Mexico and they're being fed there's cameras with um the whole way it's a movable feast I mean this is not something that people can just decide I'm going to do there has to be support did\nYou see that Trump tweet about a two word next 'cause police and military are unable to stop our the unable to now they thought that was their their country some\nPeople's I don't know you think they were all stuck on that bridge and then some people get through the ...\nThe other night we tell me they weren't looking how can they not be yeah it doesn't make any sense I think Mexico is likely to intervene because they don't want us to the new president coming in and doesn't want to have to deal with this right off the top of Trump\nBullies he's made a plea opinion yet though he's a mid request the to the UN to help process the group to determine whether or not they have valid asylum slouching\nThese people to say the right things that legally mean we have to put them in the system\nSee what's happening here there's a sentence or two but if you say that to an American official the law says we now have to so I Am I Am here for asylum alright anybody comes in and says but they are looking for asylum we have an obligation legally to put them through the system\nAnd so this is a manufactured way to overload the system\nAnd it's also no doubt meant\nTo come to a head right as we get to the midterms who's behind this it's only four thousand people just found each other on the road hey what do you go you know hey let's travel together when that happens like four thousand more times\nYou know at the whole thing is to is to get Trump to throw more red meat at his base so Don Lemon could lose his mind more than Joe and make a\nBut I think that this is a winning issue for Trump that\nChanges however if the military is put there\nAnd somebody starts firing a weapon that ... I I've got to believe that the cynical people who are behind this you know dangerous it is you see the ages of some of these children taking this track one it's incredibly dangerous and shouldn't be done but to you would have\nTo know there's going to be some sort of support\nBefore you did that with a child who's eight or nine years old you're not just to go walking in the well we might run a water when you have a child that age so this is set up\nAnd it's set up to make Trump look terrible but I don't know that it's going to work unless of course bullets or fired then we get into a whole different universe where reality does not matter and whether or not you win that politically he may he may win that politically\nBut I just if I was encouraging these people to have this caravan I'd be putting American flags in every hand they be singing the star Spangled Banner as they were walking you want to open up the hearts of Americans I'm a libertarian\nBut my point of view is we're putting out there again I Believe that Americans are born all over this planet every day and we're lucky when every one of those people find their way to America\nAmerica very much is a mindset about freedom about being a risk taker\nAnd there are people who are born an oppressive governments all over the world to look to America and the idea of America and they see freedom and they're in love with it and I tell you this country is never harmed when one of those people makes it to America\nThis is not what this looks like to me this looks like left wing activist who don't live in
