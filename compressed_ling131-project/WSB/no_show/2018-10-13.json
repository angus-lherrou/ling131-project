J. black reports from Baton Rouge soldier\nFans of build New Orleans last forty eight hours and are not ready to head north to wipe all for the dog has a chance to prove a number two ranking is for real with some doubts reaping in over the last month\nSparse questions that are ... there'll be answered this week\nAs verbiage marshmallows you can imagine you're a pound for pound it down with her talent with two top ten wins already bought a top last last week but it'd be agree they're going to have a chip on a show them as receive retiring God when you do have settled on ... chose sorts of Lebanon vertical returning from Baton Rouge they told us but\nWe bought a house last year and it was built in Nineteen eighty apparently they didn't believe it kept saying we have two bathrooms they're both pretty much the size of a powder in with a top ... a little like a large crowd around with the tops\nWell in a master bedrooms we have a walk in closet which is right next to it and so we can basically knock down the law and nice to walk in closet and there's another closet air that we can buy out and make it into a law walk in closet is it worth the cost of doing it as far as resale value is it worth it\n[noise] so how long do you anticipate you'll be in the home\nNot long after five years\nI Would recommend doing it um kitchens bathrooms do sell homes or early we took a call where the the gentleman was planning on selling in a few months\nAnd in that case I wouldn't recommend doing it but in this case you'll be able to enjoy the new bathroom you know um it'll add value to your your life and\nUm you know it'll be something that you know I'm sure once it's completed you'll\nBe happy that you've done it and then over time that dollar for dollar will catch as the market rises in value\nAnd uh since once again a most buyers are sort of wild by the kitchen and bathroom a really nicely appointed master bathroom makes a big difference um particularly where you're still able to have that walk in closet 'cause that that would be my fear if you if you sacrificed too much closet space\nUm it may backfire a little bit\nBut um no I think that makes sense and I think that once again you'll get to enjoy it for a few years as well and um you know it seems like a good bet my my eyes\nGreat thank you that's what I needed and\nPlus you'll be able to enjoy the new bathroom smell for a while that's right\n[laughter] oh that'd be so much fun\nWith life rather than the old Bethany Schmidt [laughter] I can tell you that thanks to the world is I think you\nFor all for eight seven to zero seven fifty is the number still have time for a couple more calls I'm under the er the the guidance that\nIf I'm going to live in a house for more than three months I wanted to be the way I wanted to be yeah so I don't think I should hesitate to knock down a wall or put it in a bathroom or because I'm living in a house I Want to enjoy the house yeah I don't want to be crampton my powder room or whatever\nI I just say go ahead and do it now in five years is is plenty of time but you know enjoy your house you're going to live in it and it's going to I think no matter what you upgrade it in a house it may not be dollar for dollar but it's going to improve the resale value of that house correct if you make a man cave and you know you put it in a new one or\nAre you buses out you added ... that's actually are pretty big return these days that is true but if you you know a thing you do to fresh in that house is going to help that house selling the future so might as well enjoy it and go for\nIt it's a key point I think that people make the mistake of thinking too much about the future value and not making the home work for them\nAnd I think generally if people do that it will add value down the line um you know you just have to be cautious ongoing too extreme you know maybe you know data and cave is a little too you know personal lives right but at the end of the day if you're home\nSo maybe the way you want to share that can be any kind of tell you I [laughter] I I I hear advertisements on on WSBIU sure about march than realty and they're not really the same that I've I've heard in the past you've always said mark has always been on our air saying if we can't sell your house will buy a house right but now I hear ads and say we'll\nBuy your house cried like that's an option right off the bat we don't have to wait till we can't sell it will buy it right off the bat explain that you know because I also hear people call them at a rip off\nUh yeah so I mean to your point on the program has shifted it used to be would lift your home for a period of time and if the home did not sell at the end of that time period we would a purchase it\nUm but the reality was is that it wasn't really super compelling for some of our customers\nAnd so over the past few years this technology um has improved a data on real estate transactions has become easier to gain access to 'em as well as um uh some folks entering the space um that have a sort of created what we would call sort of a new I buy her model\nUm we felt like we had to shift ours to be competitive and so\nEssentially how it works is if somebody calls in um you know there are some area restrictions conditional restrictions for example I'm over four hundred thousand and value\nUm are typically does not qualify for the program um and so what will happen is we'll have our a guaranteed offered apartment running analysis of the home value we asked for a lot of data points from the home cellar on that initial phone call\nAnd we take those data points and were able to generate a cash offer if it kinda fits the parameters of the program\nAnd so then our real estate team will come out um we like to call her agents consultants because they're going to show you basically all of your options um you know market retail value um you know we can kind of work with a home so to even create a strategy where maybe they don't want the guaranteed offer but they need to sell quickly so we can price the home in a way to drive that\nAnd then the guaranteed offer and so we just put them side by side and so about Fifteen Percent of our home sellers opt to take the guaranteed offer um so the majority are still going the market listing route I'm\nBuilding at your choices night you're not just take this offer and then well you're done\nAbsolutely we we want to be the a full service broke her with options for our clients you know in other words some companies only do the cash purchase some companies only are able to market your home\nOr you know sort of what we would say the traditional way um but for us we want to have options for our clients and customers so you know there is a discount to market value to be clear um but it's not an extreme or we're not a investors looking to you know uh some of the folks out there that you know send a\nLetter is in the mail to folks who maybe recently lost a loved one that's not what this program is um you know depending on the circumstances it can be anywhere from a you know a five to ten or ... percent discount\nOn putting my hundred thousand dollar house up and you're going to give me fifty five thousand for it and and I'm On my way I mean it's not that big of a again this is not a\nA huge because I heard someone talking yeah they're going to take thirty or forty percent of your what's your home's value is I don't know if I'm putting in a town they're not not at all but this is what I heard and I thought well that doesn't sound like a deal\nBut well you know if we did that I don't know that we would be in business for much longer right um and so you know it's not for everybody to be clear about what we find is that folks that maybe have a\nYou know sort of a a you know some life change you know sometimes yeah and unexpected job transfer a right to go and for me you know I'm very close with my wife and three children and you know I Would not want to be separated from them for three or four months waiting for you know traditional market listing sale\nOr if I'm In Chicago right so you know uh I Would be somebody that would be interested in this program um sometimes it's a state type sales where maybe a you know the mother and father's passed away and the children are left to you know deal with the state and\nUm for them they don't want to you know hang on to this process for a long period of time and then sometimes it's conditional issues that we took a call earlier where maybe the person had been in the home for thirty forty years and just doesn't have the cash laying around to do a full renovation\n'em and are willing to take that you know discount so it's a it's a trade right it's do you want you know top dollar or do you want time inconvenience and you know for some right time is money like they say\nUm and so for some it's more compelling just to take that offer so there to be clear there's an inspection period just like any other buyer we'd want to make sure that the homes in good condition um but uh once against a great program and I'm a we're excited about and a lot of folks in the community seem to be excited\nAbout and it's just one of the options you get there is no this is your only bagel you get this is your an option you can do it this way you can do it this way we can take care of this way and it's just another option out there and he won their conditioning un am FM stereo you know do you want\nThat one out of ... just another thing
