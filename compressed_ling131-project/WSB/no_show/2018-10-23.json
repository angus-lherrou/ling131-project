I never I mean I have a problem with it\nUm and then he struck a deal with the NFL to spend a hundred million to tackle social issues and ... kind of social issues are going to tackle that okay\nAt least he's trying to look at it proactively whereas Reid's like I'm just going to Neil I'm not going to offer even make a move towards any sort of reconciliation I'm just you know and so\nThat's and read was one of the first people who ... Catholic but what got me is how the world is read telling Jenkins that Jenkins as a sellout\nBecause Jenkins worked with the NFL to get money spent towards the issues that he think thought needed attention and so ... called Jenkins is El Nino colonialists because he stopped kneeling because the NFL said that they were gonna\nUh that\nWe're going to work with us how why is read so managing Malcolm Jenkins he didn't change his ... his concern he just got active about it and read it was apparently ticked off because Jenkins decided to be proactive am I missing something here how\nDoes that make him a neo colonialist\nStupidest thing I've ever heard\nThe more the more job what does the angrier I get over it well\nThat he hasn't done anything he\nJust wants to go out there and get it get attention friends out he was one of the first people that Neal the cabinet\nAnd he said that Jenkins co opted it he said he goes he collected the movement that was started by calling to get his

knowledgeable on as we lack of praise and ready to take it delays style out\nAgain this is I feel this morning with the open Mike there's like a it's like I'm I'm arguing and my wife you know when did I say when did I argue that he should back down to ... that's not what I argued\nI got one more thing to add to that yes the blog on with all due respect with all due respect and he won [laughter] you got it\nMy point is he lessons that affect the exact effect that that caller is calling about\nWhen he allows himself to get into a back and forth and then come off his defense if I thought he was making great points\nAbout Kavanaugh and then he says oh doesn't matter we won no that's not the reason why it does matter you won but your point should be it still does matter in terms of the mid term it matters in terms of the terms of kind of more I Would say in terms of the midterms but you get what I'm saying it matters\nIt will always matter that we found out\nThat there is a portion of this country that believes on certain issues you remove the presumption of innocence that's important after victory and so what I'm saying to this open my career is I think that he does well until he gets caught up in the back\nAnd forth then he gets defensive and then he says things that are just outright silly like to Leslie stall I'm president and you are not\nMany ... and ...\nRead a cut of apropos did not fair since they didn't run as far as I Know\nWhen I was making ... when you did it for time I was telling you that you've seen in me much differently on the subject I can say that I don't want to have that type of job okay All right now to fight with the nighttime I'm president when you are not\nJust say I'm when when I see somebody like Leslie stall being that combative I don't think that she shouldn't be that combative I think she should have been that combative with\nObama as well I don't think it should go the other way I think Trump thinks that he should be revered by the press or something because he's president I don't think it should go that way which poll winding obvious to me is the attitude of the interviewer\nWhen you change out the interviewee because when the interviewee was Obama\nWe got questions in the press corps like uh what's been the most magical moment of less knocked off manning luckily light to green yeah\nStall actually brought one a reporter is supposed to bring the problem is they only bring it when they're reporting on and interviewing Republicans\nFavorite thing to order from the White House kitchen oh I must be a Democrat [laughter]\nLate at night I\nI get hungry for murder say give me a cheeseburger put a little Megan on that so wonderful and I got ... because she doesn't like me and all that bad but\nThat's where I stand the attitude Lesley Stahl brought last night no problem with it but it should apply to every president every politician but she interviews and that's just clearing we obvious that that doesn't happen given the justice position between Obama and Trump and that goes through the whole press corps\nNow ever since uh the UN came out with that climate report last week in Al Gore it's just been going all crazy about it oh the ... of\nThe ridiculous climate report that says if we don't do drastic things so that that's twelve years it's the end of the world correct never heard of such a ...\nNow there's open Mike or brings up a good point about climate change\n... some climate change look back\nAnd see where the ocean used to be about ah twenty is through state of Georgia a terminal so yeah so am all Florida was on the war but a long time ago\nHis show was different than it is today\nYeah Sarah famously was re wasn't rain forest for a while [laughter]\nUh this is true what he says is true the climate does change the climate the idea that it's just stayed in one thing forever and now you're not supposed to see a drastic change in your lifetime\nBut uh yeah I mean all people don't know that the Sahara was or wasn't rain forest there was a desert and then it was a rain forest and there was a desert again so things things change in this world they say um changes the only thing that stays the same once if you understand that about life\nYou will get over so much grief\nEspecially when you get into your like mid thirties like autumn\n[laughter] start thinking about oh man I'm Free is happy when I was Twenty one [laughter] they're asking how never and that's the mentally speaking beyond the climate or anything that's just great advice once you can absorb the fact that change\nIs the only thing that stays the same life becomes a lot easier because you stop being surprised by change\nWell this next open Mike should make I Know you're just giving some wisdom the autumn there about being in her thirties this head to every one hell of course and uh everybody else but oftentimes often autumn get on and\nOff you know one of those [laughter] [laughter] oh yeah\nHe tosses the tea and yeah it's often said to be there thank you thank you I don't\nYou don't use those of Mike is for you that's why I often you get serenaded by by some of our listeners and here's
