this can we help this candidate oh no let's run this ad that's put much racism defined I think that\nThere are well I'm going to play the ad for you first\nAnd I just know that Democrats have done stuff like this in my home state of Missouri\nThey were robo calls like this there were mailers that went out that were similar to this before like Republicans are going to kill all the blind people I hate it when they do it and I'm just shocked that this pact chose to do this it's a ... a sixty seconds spot and just listen to what just listen to what does that go\nWhat do you think about what's happening in Washington\nCongress may French and the Republicans know that it's dangerous to change the presumption of innocence tort presumption of guilt especially for black me if the Democrats can do that to a white justice of the Supreme Court with no ... no operation and witnesses including her best friend so you didn't have\nHusband fathers when white girl lives on the girl\nWon't be laughing black folk again always told my son is going to be something wrong with that if you get caught she will crime rate I'm\nVoting to keep Congress my French and the Republican because we have to

for the president's agenda not authorized by any standard for candidates committee\nNow the pet can do whatever they want to do as black Americans for Trump agenda there you know people can fundraise and they can [noise] doesn't mean that everybody has the best ideas\nAnd I don't know I don't know this pack I don't know anybody involved with it I just know previously when I Know that there have been races before where packs have decided to do something that they thought were helped the was helping candidate and it's like no that does not help the candidate\nHere's the thing though I'm\nEverything that they're saying in the ad aside from the lynching because I don't think Democrats want to Lynch black people just like I don't think that the Democrats have previously said Republicans wanna Lynch why people I don't think Republicans are by people I don't think Republicans won a landslide people I just think we could probably make a point with all engines\nAside from that\nEverything that they're saying in it is literally things that I have conversations I have had an every woman I Know has had all of my female friends particularly the moms are boys we have all had these conversations with each other all of this half\nAnd\nWhen they say that you know a girl could uh you know lie or and I\nShared with your story after story after story of this or where you have the presumption of guilt as opposed to in a sense these are huge things that are cornerstones of our republic it's due process and they're very serious issues and there\nIs a cultural war against that and so the ad brings that up and I I mean those are those are things that a lot of people have have discussed\nThe problem comes in when it's well everybody's going to get lunch I'm just that completely undermined and just robbed\nAll of the other points of any attention when that happened there just was not going to do I I mean I heard this the first time and I went oh my gosh what what I just and I don't and I know from what I understand because it's black Americans for the Trump agenda [noise]\nI don't know how that plays in the black community even if it's done by a a black organization\nI don't know how that ... I mean I just think regardless it robs the ... the more important points that were being made at the beginning the fact that due process is under attack\nDue process is being undermined our Fourth Amendment rights are being undermined and there is absolutely and I have talked about this I've mentioned it in my books a cultural war on boys\nAnd it just missed\nAll of that because they went from talking about this to\nBoom genes I just\nIt's it's a problem with the left has when they talk about skin color to work it's not\nWe all know that that's not it right the ... it's someone's character that makes them who they are has nothing to do with their skin color so I think you're right they diluted be really important message which actually there's a lot of important information and messaging in that commercial if it goes important but when they talk about the white Dems lynching or white girl calling rape or whatever [noise]\nIt loses it loses me you know what I mean there's a bed messages loss for me completely and\nI was identifying with them at first like oh these are boy moms and I'm listening to boy I'm like I Know and then right when they went to the ... I'm like oh\nYou're they care about their husbands their sons their their grand pose the care about those pretty addicted but then when you went right into that left the tactic of saying it say um you know what I mean that's what it's all left the tactic that turns people off and we saw it in twenty six and\n... and people need to realize that didn't work for them just as you said it did it work for Democrats than twenty sixteen so why would we use it ... why would anybody on the right use it\nLike you said it takes the focus of what really use the solid messaging other spot and just focuses it on the frivolous empty lefty tactic\nYeah that's the ... that was an four to ... I think it was you know you have boy moms talking and it's a powerful testimony from boy moms I'm not saying anything of that girl ... but you know ... moms are boys you know you all know and to hear them discuss but then right and then they took it they use that identity politics that that\nAh ah\nThat identity politics that tactic that we have seen the left are you so often and that's when never ever adopt of an unsuccessful tactic from the left never because it will if it's it's not that it never has gone to work it's not going to work if it doesn't work then it's not going to work with you\nIncredible advancement and they use the stem cell therapy has brought new hope that we can eliminate pain and give you their freedom you desire to get back in the game this is Melinda Skelton and I'm a patient have Dr Rick ... the leading expert in stem cell therapy and hosted the regeneration radio show on ws the\nYou haven't chronic pain are having problems with your joints her back learn about the advancements in stem cell therapy an application stopped her and brothers accuses to levy eight pain and increase activity I'm blown away by the success stories and incredible results we're seeing in this field\nBy the nation's leading expert in stem cell therapy now if you're interested in learning more and consulting with Dr Ambrose ... visit the website Dr Rick dot C. oh that is letter D R Rick dot ...\nI have no problem with fall as long as it's a season you know autumn\nNot if it's a verb like Kaboom and if you have problems with your foundation will Kaboom could be\nThe final result Doug terrible year for ... if you're noticing inside your house the doors are closed it correctly or maybe the floor has a slope you didn't realize or outside UC cracks the foundation and you're just not sure they are\nCalled the experts at a field Atlanta rap jak foundation repairs all they do get your free estimate just like I've done at Atlanta ramp jak dot com\nOr we do an enormous amount of complex proper GRE pancreas liver surgery here we'd have expertise in surgery\nExpertise in terms of people helping you and the operating room\nDr ...

I Want to talk about this tonight this this is something that broke this morning I\nGuess you actually at twelve or one AM um Sears, Roebuck how we had heard bankruptcy I work for them for years\nDid you really need to do or what we all know what I Want to hear about\nThis what ... ... let's hear Chuck's work it's your story first yeah when I when I decided to get into radio and I went back to school like twelve years ago uh the only job I could get was working and shipping receiving it Sears in Missoula, Montana and I worked\nThat I work with all the way like a warehouse or\nWorse ... yeah it was a big warehouse I did was on ... stuff\nAnd get it put out for the uh for customers out on the floor or whatever has worked for shipping receiving Missoula, Montana yep and then I finally worked my way I worked at long enough I worked up into appliances which is a sweet gig 'cause that was all and then you're in the store yes they let me in the store you work on commission I Would ask a lot of them I read a lot of money we're giving here's\nA couple of years ago I went to the Sears up in Cumberland and I walked in and it was right after I got on TV and um and I walk in and this guy comes up his hey what's going on I was like you work on commission he goes yeah All right you're lucky man I Need a fridge raider oh I had a dishwasher I Need a washing machine virus was for that yeah he's like I'm I'm going home at\nNine AM today oh yeah yeah I made that guy's native year yeah because\nHe was he was so happy he's like yeah are you serious especially refrigerators they were big commission yeah you want to sell all my wife is in one shot nice yeah this guy so you worked at a at Sears as well in a yeah in Austin, Texas in the state yeah so what did you do it's years our small ticket\nTools [laughter] oh yeah basically ... old yeah there are some guys have already who came in and said hey I needed a need to finish the rancher Philippe said yeah I Would agree it was like all the big items like the generator ... lawn mowers and trains are they wouldn't let you touch those well you weren't really supposed to go over there and it was all there is a territory was frowned\nUpon kind of thing or yeah yeah but\nIf the thing was the loophole was if somebody went over there and there was nobody there were they were all there is no ... asked me like hey I Want to go by that law and more\nCan you get it for me to ... and you could do it where they kind of like you know were there was no no no no I was already graduated it was I was I had gotten a job and radio and it was part time and I've worked with that at a liquor store and at the radio station\nAnd see what was that was the outfit when you guys worked at Sears just khaki you having a blue shirt ad driver yours mine was a green shirt but no yeah because you were ...\nYeah as a red green and red Yahoo mall ticket ... they they changed green to like lawn and garden but the guy didn't want to wear ... and a Deborah ... three courses in our ... or ... years yeah what did you do their salary\nJewel yeah he's right when he graduated ahead on lay down and I moved up here and I didn't know anybody to know anything about the city and I just needed a job and the easiest thing I could do is retail\nSo I just walked in there and you know they they weren't\nHappy friendly Ron lie to pick me happy for the\nSame thing and worked on commission sold a lot of jewelry I mean I made enough money there that I put a down payment on my house you know Ken that we have seen time very yeah did you get hourly as well as his yeah really and commission yeah what were you making then you know like our I don't remember now is more focused\nOn the condition 'cause you could check how much you're making throughout the day tea can log in and see how much you already made and you're like All right when they get to this part of the ...\nYeah yeah that's why he's the guy said eight to nine o'clock yeah yeah no kidding oh\nThat's fantastic yeah so All right I I'm so uh this is not an ally but I'm very intrigued by this um so ... uh let's say long ago where he goes in to buy his wife a hundred dollar pair earrings atmospheres jewelry counter yeah what what is dead green making on that purchase\nWell usually say hey I Want to look at this and then I'm like yeah these are nice but\nYou know I don't understand up yelling I get that but what if he does by a hundred dollars ...\nWill remember that I think it was like ten percent ...\nThat's why there was so good to have all the commissions were anywhere from five to like eleven percent so I buy a nine dollar wrench from\nLittle ticket Longoria and you get nine bucks a a Ninety cents yeah pretty much on top\nYou're a suit ... stocking stuffer as were great I always go over there and save some extra dollars you sell a bunch of cool kids to moms that are just want to fill stock on ... going up selling on bombs but I don't know any of the hassles was the best that I don't endorse that\nBut you have no idea they were like oh I Need that that one hundred and Nineteen\nYeah socket fit that was funny so this has nothing to do with the years but if you go in and this happened to me the other day I buy to buy a label maker and studies maybe I don't know what it was called but studies will show if there's three separate items that she bought a middle price wondering expensive one\nEveryone buys the middle one ... because no one wants to cheap one\nAnd you're like well how much better could the expensive one being ugly be so like seriously like retail outfits do this they know they price it accordingly so they're like if we need to move on with this one in the middle because people will say well I don't want the best that I don't want the worse so I'll get the middle\nAnd and they worked on me to label maker I have no I didn't know anything about the other laid my my I'll take the one in the middle\nPurposely and appliances the way they had refrigerators cheapest to most expensive no matter where everything was that all we had to do is moving into the middle of two and a half files and then just the price and it would sell that was where he went to everybody avoided the outside I\nEverybody went to the middle so when you finally needed like we really got to get rid of their for dirt had just moved to the middle and adjusted price accordingly and it was hell we did all the time it's\nUnbelievable now I Know I see is is going out of business I heard you know [laughter]\nLike that doesn't say much for years hiring Paloma you three guys work there do you remember what your hourly was\n[noise] I Can't remember I was working three jobs at the times I couldn't tell you yeah I I didn't have a series in my town\nBut I remember getting a catalog every year oh yeah the big thick one and my dad's not a tool guy so I I don't actually ever remember going to a Sears very often I couldn't even tell you where where one was boss here's meant a lot to me was when I was in college because the first\nCredit card ever got was a Sears card and I remember when it came in the mail out is like brand new shiny I never had a credit card five hundred dollar limit 'em like this is the greatest day in my life\n[laughter] so so through college if I needed something I bought it at Sears literally clothes books what\nAppliances um utensils whatever to useful to be a good TV there but that was my lifeline was my fears credit\nCard and they to this day make the best they had the best T shirt ever it was um um I think it was called Thomas Henry they were extra large extra long 'cause I got along torso\nAnd I still wear in to these to this day twenty five years later they stopped that the company that made them one out of business so they are not available anymore I'm always looking on ... Amazon foreign cars they last five years and they're so comfortable in their perfect size\nSo to me my my uh best memory is yours was in college that first credit card I stayed at the for three hours I'm like I'm an adult now this is great like it's so beautiful this and this was for seniors\nNow my ... I still have the Sears car but now it's like your MasterCard so I can ride anywhere but at the time so if I had a hot date right to Sears guy let me get those genes and that damn vast\nAnd you know this was like the first Wal Mart you could almost get anything pretty money yeah yeah he was so that was that was some great I had no idea you guys all through work there I Want to talk about fears is a declared a declaration of bankruptcy and uh and your memories of of an iconic brand new United States\nOr which which may no longer exist it means a lot to a lot of people will talk about that the catalogue the credit cards Longoria little tool guy what did they call you little small taking alumni oriented [laughter]\nWe might have a new nickname small ticket Longoria or for all for eight seven six zero seven fifty one eight hundred ws we talk on Twitter and Instagram at market and hang tight we'll be right back on WSBIU [noise]\nBad it is to eleven twenty ... twenty four hour traffic sort of\nA little slow down on the downtown connector southbound getting past a Seventy to North avenue\nA little sluggish down there and we got a crash on a mountain freeway Seventy at each spell right at two eighty five or right lane knocked out causing delays there this report brought you buy the T.
