[noise] do you mean banning stick up all over the new show [noise]\nI\nWas noticed hassles Jeff light Kamala Harris who she's wanting to abuse their power to investigate journalist and I thought everyone was supposed to support\nA free press I thought everybody supported a free press\nApparently not though ... apparently she doesn't well we're going to I Hope somebody asks\nCome on media summer you had to give me the names of the people that are moderate in this debate tonight\n[noise]\nOr it looks like we have\nJudy Woodruff of PBS NewsHour um you have St Louis Public Radio's Joe Manning's you have five on your side local anchor Mike Bush and then a question from the audience will be taken and be part of the debate as well and that will be facilitated by Ruth is ill of the nine network ...\nWell the one of which I I guess I Am a fan is uh I like my Bush I grew up with my Bush so much lifted the whole thing with that guy who will get killed in a plane crash\nThe other guy Mike what's his face not like Bob Bob Richards guy dang that's old school I remember when that happened I was a kid and I didn't quite understand exactly everything that was going on that's along my Bush has been around he's like he's like a fixture in my home town but\nI think he'll be I think he'll do decent job cause I've always seen him very professional very buttoned up\nAnd you don't really know which way he leans so I anticipate he'll do their job and I kind of stay the same for the others after him manny's might be afterwards but after that Mm\nTypical fashion it's like leaning left type organizations that are moderate\nIs it only an hour to be honest with you I don't know maybe for people for an hour for moderators for an hour well three\nModerators in one facilitating be the crowd is part of it in moderation but\nUm you know we got PBS NewsHour it's not necessarily any left leaning but I Would say ... is left of center St Louis public radio left of center\nI'm you know the nine network definitely left of center so that's usually how we see these debates go as far as moderators are concerned yeah um it's rare that we see like a conservative moderate or do these things\nYeah I agree I agree uh\nAnd I and I don't like I said I don't even know Bush's conservative my bushes until either not I have no sign of a good journalists I yeah I shouldn't know that's the thing if you're doing your job I should know you all should not know where they lean\nOr you should be confused about it if they're doing their job and that's the problem because real reporting like that you got to be a little ... you know you have to be selfless with it no one gives a crap what the reporter thinks they want to know about the facts involved that's it and uh unfortunately\nAs you've seen which I'm a cost of too many are interested in in inserting their own viewpoints in their own opinions and their own bias into it and those people are celebrated so it's like a just a vicious cycle of just you know it it rewards that so they want to do it again\nAnyway so we'll we'll see a goodness meanwhile MSNBC is trying to prop up desperately beta O'Rourke Robert or work he's got that CNN town hall tonight listen to this ridiculous headline\n... or ... campaign has transcended politics to become something of a political cultural for not phenomenon Mm [noise]\nLike his car

that would just hold meetings in front of the press\nI end the most transparent Andrew in history I'm so chance that em invisible by the way\nBy the way you think about this this is off that topic but uh he is so transparent\nWhen he talks about the uh the Saudi reporter that was a permanent American resident but from Saudi Arabia reporter that was killed in a in the consulate you talk about transparency he's just saying things that every other president will be dealing with that wouldn't say like well I don't know they got to give us a lot of money for our planet [laughter]\nThey're ... way down and I every other president behind\nThe cw having those conversations but they would never say it in front of people because they would think it would seem well you know it's a man's\nLife in the winter that Afghan [laughter]\nYou have to know that she should\nBe a rather obvious that that's not the big thing right now so he has these meetings in public and I think he likes to surprise his own cabinet members and I think this was a surprise to them when he said this\nI'm going to ask each of you to come back with a five percent budget cuts from feel there is the far as whether it's a secretary of the ministry of [laughter]\nAnd that by the way is a great idea let me just say this this is what's gonna happen\nMy name's Eric contests are I'm fifty four years of age I've seen this a million times on a CNN and MSNBC is in the world you always hear there was always a sort of lament where are the fresh ideas where the new ideas this\nIs maybe not fresh it's\nBeen around for a while but we'll be new if implemented and the CNN's or the world this is where the heck need reporting lazy reporting it so lazy I'm going to tell you what happens in over the next month or so you can watch it happen now that means that ... if I can predict what they're going to do and they just do it\nRight it's going to be lazy rather than being a reporter and saying well this is new this is different little the effects would be one of the actually worked what's gonna happen is every grievance group on the left is going to come out with a sort of a\nPR statements about what is so bad and what's going to be lost from this in that department because we're cutting back five percent and the lazy reporters are going to rip and read that you're going to be bombarded\nWith nothing but reports about how many children are going to starve because such and such department is cutting five percent when common sense tells you five percent of any budget can be cut any budget having to do with anything five percent of it is waste\nCommon sense tells you that\nBut lazy reporting I mean it's like when he asked that question when he when he put that directive out there it's like in a horse race where the gates open\nI Know where these were reporting horses are going\nThey're going right to their computers right to their emails that they get their emails from such and such group or the group and favorite feed the hungry in the ... who the hotter than nine thousand different groups that are ... that are in favor of the so called little people\nAnd this is how reporting is going to be for the next month story after story after story about who gets hurt\nIf we cut five percent\nOf the budget from every cabinet but common sense tells you that five percent of your damn household budget could be cut\nYou might have to quit smoking mutts [laughter] but but it could be caught\nThat's this is an example please mark this down I Want this to be an example if we can agree that it must be lazy reporting if I tell you exactly what's going to happen to the next month and then it happens\nThere are very few ... no reporters\nAfter that story thinking themselves that's interesting that will be different I better start doing some reporting on what the real world effects of that will work how much money can be saved you will not see stories like that maybe on Fox but who cares that's just preaching to the choir\nAll the stories will be what different interest groups tell reporters will be the downside of losing five percent from this one that won in that one that's what's gonna happen because there is no real rapper Taj left in\nThis country do you think anybody will buy his uh any plan that he talked about in that same law he says he wants to five penny plan right then\nPorn penny

a good idea and it was not explained pretty well their activities had Neko can step in and I step in here basically what's being said there is there's been an idea out there for a long time that makes sense if you take a penny out of every government dollars spent\nFor the fiscal year so for every one dollar you're supposed to spend you actually spend Ninety nine cents it turns out that it only takes a couple of years\nTo shrink the budget deficit and a lot of other things you save a lot of money so what he's saying is we've taken a long time so let's do five cents rather than one penny so that's really the plan if you think to yourself before you get this onslaught of all the children that are going to die because of this\nThat's the concept for him for every one dollar every single dollar the government plans to spend they spend Ninety five cents\nThis is Richard bishop owner fertile kitchens are slogan as life happens here and we mean\nOctober as an emotional reminder for those

understand how that [laughter] so I\nI I really I just saw the country's not maybe it's Poland or maybe it's a Bulgaria I don't know one of these companies that have countries that has a right wing government right now and they they got rid of gender studies\nAnd public universities\nThe the you know the the money goes a government money goes in those universities and stuff that you can still do it as a private in university and you don't have government money and I don't know if that was very hungry I don't know is the right thing to do or not but\nThat was a statement by the prime minister I don't know some of these places have presidents and prime ministers whoever the head of government is in Hungary and he just said a we think people are born either a male or female\nAnd I thought wow how Russia [laughter] refreshing that that that they believe that people are just born male or we're getting to the point where you know\nYou you look and I don't like that at all I Know you don't I mean no no no the uh the uh uh animal can do no no no no no I agree with where animals or you look around the animal kingdom\nThere's no identifying or it's just the male and female we are a animals I really ... so much of this stuff is just hubris oh we're so important that we are changing the weather\nOh boy\nWe're ... we're so important that we're beyond gender or animals the other animals are male or female or male or female\nAnd then how about this live and let live\nLive your life as a male or female any damn way you want to I mean damn why you want to an American that's the way that it should be\nI'm a male and I live my life this way or another male he lives his life totally differently oh there's a female that ultimate things are being confused here\nWas what's important all this important is that we live and let live so long as there's no danger involved so long as you're not trying to murder me you're allowed to do what you\nWant but\nWe've really been dragged by these academics into an area that is really getting absurd\nYou're born male or female amend your brain and experience of environment enters into it and then live your life as you want to if you want to be a male who are you lose your life with another male is a partner them do that\nIf you're a male who feels like a female feels like a female everything's cool live and let live\nBut to go right down to the bottom of it and say no that that's a construct that's that's that's a patriarchal construct that you're either born male or female well if you're if we're not\nWe're the only animal\nThat isn't because there are I guarantee you there or not would just running around going on I don't know I don't know who would identify with\nThey don't have the brain capacity to spread all their gender I'm a\n... as a what Chuck\nHey you know what maybe maybe typically male would Chuck are gathering sticks or something and the emails or not but there's some female will check out their gathering sticks yeah expressing herded and live a male and as the ... world goes and I don't think that what Chuck should be allowed to get may\nBe all that matters is how much would want to talk about what could be or her oh yeah [laughter]\nThat's all that matters it is really interesting I mean I Believe in gender fluidity I'm fine with that I don't know like I live and let live I'm Glad you said believe 'cause there's no notes religion I Believe when someone at you know is growing up in and saying that maybe they were trapped inside of a the opposite sex ... that's fine\nBut when we talk about saying whether they're a male or female sex on their birth certificate I don't understand why that that's an issue you can be born male and then\nBe female as your gender as an adult I don't understand why you have to say ... or even when you have to go back into your birth certificate\nYou know you're a a very reasonable crazy person there but ultimately\nMost of the argument just sounds like craziness today\nYou're if you're a male\nTrapped inside of a female body [noise]\nGood live your life that way yeah that's who you are but you were born with certain parts and that indicates what you are and
