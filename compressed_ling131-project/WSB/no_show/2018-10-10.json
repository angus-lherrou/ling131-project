to come back home on the cross the bridge so you're so deep combs ABC News animosity Beach Florida and in New York\nI see to me it doesn't even really matters the concept of a it's not like if you are the best pitcher in America is the best baseball pitcher in America and you're from the smallest town in America the major leagues will find you your talent will be found\nYou'll start pitching is illegal unit here in small towns the word but get out scouts will come and find you you'll end up on a major league team you'll have a career and then people will decide based on your stats whether you belong in a legitimate hall of fame like the baseball hall of fame here's the problem with music\nThere is a good possibility that I've never heard the best rock and roll band of all time because maybe they only we're together from Nineteen sixty seven to Nineteen Seventy one and they never really got passed a\nMinneapolis Saint Paul area see what I'm saying now it's possible that most of us have never heard the best rock band\nHowever it's not possible that if you the best baseball pitcher in America that you're not going to be found so sports hall of fame makes sense but music is subjective and so what's happening since we're not making any more big rock and roll bands is over time\nEveryone's going to get in and then you just expand ... rock and roll means so you bring in rap and you bring in Madonna and the whole thing is ridiculous but then again\nWhat do I care why am I spending the first twelve minutes of my show on this I don't give a damn give me some real news\nAlright big story here today is the last eight to register to vote here in Georgia for the mid term elections like Stacey Abrams area like Brian given the editorial racy got registered today\nI got to choose between ah the guy who points a gun at a teenager\nThat's one ad tells me and then I got a ... or the lady who apparently ran for governor just so we could have more pedophilia around [laughter] I mean I I hear that uh that camp is not doing very well\nAnd uh I'm I've got to wonder if it's because of two things won his primary campaign may have just been too weird for people in in general and uh then I just think that the opening salvo of even\nEven if you don't believe in Stacey Abrams a programs ideas I don't I'm not a liberal I don't believe in those kind of socialistic\nThings you know our people really got to buy the idea that she's a she's a fan of ah pedophilia that seems like I I just I think as soon as much I don't think it's going to land with people and so I think he comes off as a you know bit of a goofball\nWell not to not to mention too when I I've seen a lot of people with Instagram post 'cause obviously he's doing his state wide tour and so people don't get pictures with them and putting\nThat I saw him at the UGA again yeah so in Tempe took a picture of them too and there's something I Know appearances shouldn't be a factor but\nHe's the only in a weird smile yeah which mounted veins says yeah strange like it's like it's not ... but it's a nice a smile a little more ... there is also true his his smile seems insincere that doesn't mean that it's in ... and he he just has a smiley a great guy\nBut uh the smile seems insincere but I look I Know that states like Georgia are certainly bluer than they used to be but they're still read it's not time\nFor a a Stacey Abrams to beat a a a a Republican in the state of Georgia and if it happens now you got to lay it soundly on the camp camp or because what's gonna happen is\nIf he loses it means people just didn't get excited about him and they didn't get off the couch and they didn't go out and\nSo it seems like what's happening right now a little bit that I don't sense a whole lot of excitement\nAmongst Republicans about Brian Kemp to get like four weeks left yesterday something up but I Would say here's a good idea I heard Elizabeth Warren is coming into town to uh give a speech for Stacey Abrams alright get rid of the ridiculous pedophilia nonsense which isn't true and nobody's buying\nAnd just\nTake clips from Elizabeth Warren saying how much she loves Stacey Abrams and put that in your ads I mean this this is not difficult uh but\nThey don't seem to be it's not a very well run campaign you know doing a great job in the primary means zero in the general election that's just that's just the pre game and they don't seem to have had a second act\nWill maybe it'll open the door for the mysterious had met she's running a libertarian\nLibertarian candidate he he's falling consistently at two percent so you're saying is that perhaps he could possibly if humor is hard to get to point three plural point you might even though I I I just I feel like in this kind of a libertarian still even really run I don't I don't see ... I don't know what Ted match looks like and I've probably seen them already in this\nPolitical climate area don't you think that a libertarian or any third party for that matter could really make a run and\nThey should be able to but not the libertarians let me tell you something I Love my libertarians but a a a party they are not\nTheir party in name only they don't really understand there's something that people need to understand about parties this applies to every party Republican Democrat libertarian whatever they're there and and this is the Republicans who called other Republicans rhinos don't understand parties exist for one reason\nTo win elections like your favorite sports team that exist for one reason to win games how do you judge it how many games were one how is the party judged what is the only the single criterion by which party should be judged\nDo you win and by that single criteria and\nLibertarians have never won anything of any consequences whatsoever so it's not a real and I would say the same thing to my Republican friends who like to point to other Republicans and say you are not pure enough\nYou're not a real Republican you're not understanding what a party is a party is not just supposed to be the pure and the faithful you've got to reach out and get a bunch of people into that tent get them to the polls and\nThen you get a government that kind of goes the way you want [laughter] that's about the best you get out of this world a government that kind of goes the way that you want to expect more is to be continually disappointed until

pregnant [laughter] who's got back to generic Democrat what I just think people are to me [laughter]\nI mean people suck All right back to the generic Republican well I Want my taxes lowered are\nThese the generic Democrats and I said it's pretty close to these ... these are they going to go to the polls yes generic Democrat I Wonder if you're a Democrat you're a Republican what's a generic Democrat\nI have no idea how you would classify as bad ideas\nAnd no personality generic should immigrant so welfare for every ... ... should have to pay for college but it's all fair trade coffee beans those\nAs long as no names were harmed in the making of the car when also coffees to\nWait a minute I'm a generic Republican and I like dirty air and dirty water so low use it means I make more money\n[noise] recycling almost everything and I have a compost pile in my backyard\nGuys my buddy generic Democrat\nWe get together at the CNN diners and to talk politics we disagree\nWe were not far for better or the or only four weeks after the midterms so after we get done with ah the hack need hurricane coverage here over before long CNN will be going to diners to ask people what they think and who they're going to vote\nThey're going to get like Kansas\nLook I tell you I have never Republicans are so stupid I have mapped into the greasy spoons [laughter] I have never in my late ... people in a real [laughter] I don't I don't think I've ever talked about politics at a diner in my life once [laughter] somebody's with according to CNN that's what America did\nThat [laughter] we disagree she's a good babysitter so we keep her around [laughter]\nAll right well right now and then when I got\nNews for you it does nobody does until you know the only poll that matters is when people actually go out and vote it looks like\nA the the left has been energized for two years the right has gotten very energized in the post Kavanaugh and now so if both sides are are lit up then is about who gets out and votes who gets their people out and we're not going to do that until the mid term\nYeah right now and again this generic Republican jet generic Democrat that gives a Thirteen point difference generic Democrats leading fifty four percent vote\nRight if if a if a bunch of those generic Democrats are on college campuses uh you know if you if you are if you place a keg between them and the polling place\nThey're probably not going to vote that day I mean college student sometimes vote sometimes they don't people in the early twenties sometimes out an awful lot of the the the least reliable voters a Democrat activists know this young people are the least reliable to actually get to the polls older people\nTend to go out and vote and the older you get\nYour vote because you're getting more welfare [laughter] so you don't want your vote against people are going to take away your program so works both ways a left and right but young people\nYou don't know until you know Obama he got them to vote ... usually it takes ... a charismatic individual to get young people actually vote so we'll see what happens well\nThere's ... there's a lotta setting where I\nStand we'll see what this happens my tune into the bond hustler doctrine maybe something\nWill happen with bold line\nGeneric radio [laughter]\nYeah All right there's a lot of speculation in the media as to why Nikki Haley decided to walk away from her UN ambassador gig\nYeah a lot of people don't know I felt weird to me I said this yesterday as some of that a weird press conference that ah\nI only this is him talking about her right here\nShe got to know China Russia India and she knows everybody that are very first day basis\nSo she got to know all the all the other countries have trees in the world and like\nMr China Mr Chad met Mr chads the single guy right beside sheds a single guy and\nA lot of people I think it was weird and I think that is true that we don't at least that hasn't been reported exactly\nWhy she resigned and why they had that press conference yesterday when she's staying for twelve more weeks basically so it was it was it was a little odd now there are a couple of things out there there's a there's a a we talked about yesterday a little bit of a brewing scandal having to do with a a private plane\nYeah believe it's seven flights that she should not have\nAn Aussie undervalued apparently so it's a brewing scandal I don't know if that's enough\nBecause that broke like two days before she resigned it seems like something that she would have been able to get through a there's also some truth to the idea that uh she probably is not completely on board with where both ... and pump AR ah so there's probably a little bit of that but\nI think it's to other things those are the real reasons one is she's been in government a long time and apparently she's not very rich she has a lot of debts so she needs to go make some money I think that's part of it and there's nothing wrong with that\nThat's the way that we all think also I think she wants to be president and she wants to be president\nIn twenty twenty four now she's forty six or forty seven now she'll be fifty two fifty three\nIn a in twenty twenty four so I think that's really what's driving this um if she wants to be president she's going to walk away now so the Trump Administration with really glowing reviews one of the only members of the administration disliked by both sides so she can't get anything more\nFrom her association with Trump and she already has by\nLeaving now also if things go bad over the next two to four to six years [noise]\nSee will existence or self enough of the Trump Administration but it wouldn't hurt a twenty twenty four and run [noise] so I think that's what it's about that's the real the things you're talking about I Need to make some money and then I'm going to go run for president [laughter]\nDoctorate every
