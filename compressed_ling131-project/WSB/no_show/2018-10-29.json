manufacture a bomb or explosive with an attempt to harm somebody or kill them then you get life in prison\nSo right there now so first thing that we have to we don't know yet is\nBecause we have conspiracy theorists like Tim Andrews here who believes that none of these bombs are working bombs\nThat they're just meant to frighten and Tim Andrews who has this conspiracy minded here's believes that the authorities are not telling us that for some ... some odd reason now let's say that there was no way these bombs could kill somebody\nYou're still looking at the terrorists and stuff right
