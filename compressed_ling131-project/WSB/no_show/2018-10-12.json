S.\nRich people Eric too many shameful\nThis is one of those stupid stupid surveys you disagree with Bloomberg\nI disagree with Bloomberg in this case yes I Do the entire no the reason that this happens is because we have so much wealth gr activity so you you get into a situation where oh yeah well maybe you go to another city and there's not that much of a gap\nBut overall there's not much wealth they're either that's why there isn't a gap\nIn capitalism there's always going to be a gap\nBut it's also the best system for you to get from where you were to where you're going and making that possible and as long as you have what you want is something called dynamism does that make it as something to think\nTheory will know that that's not the food for your pets that we always play during Rush Limbaugh has\nThat title fight you know skin was scared because I started giving that code is clean to me that's the title fight ... he had he\nTalking about nine of Mrs ... plus that\nThat means that in your system what's important is that you got people going up and he got people coming down and it's dynamic and things are moving around and in that situation if you take a snap shot at any one moment\nYou're going to find people up and people down but that's not really the story the story is are people moving up from down our our people on the top losing a bunch of money in rolling back down\nThat's the most important thing so a survey like that says that Atlanta is a great city because it means you can move to Atlanta you can be an enterprising person and you've got a chance to move up the reason other cities aren't in there and maybe considered better\nIs because there's not enough of wealth to create the gap between the rich and the poor that's what you want in your city you know it reminds me of a survey that was done I read this years ago where they said uh the the most are the most peaceful nations in the world\nAnd one of the things that they would go by one of the metrics was how much money you spend on the military was one of the things that put in there so America because we have all this money in about six hundred and thirty five billion dollars or something a year so we weren't peaceful at all\nBut Canada was right at the top of the list the top five of most peaceful countries now you could look that and say oh Canada must be more peaceful oh no wait a minute candidate doesn't need to spend money on their military why\nBecause our military is their military so in reality if anybody invading Canada are we going to sit in our hands no so they don't have to worry about it we actually are protecting them\nAnd Europe and basically the whole world now and that's why we spend so much money on the military were creating peace but if you go by that survey where one of the least peaceful countries in the world somebody real point is\nDon't believe any surveys ever about anything that's really when I was getting a cause it all depends on if it's a it's an editorial wrapped up in numbers this happens a lot where\nPeople feel like well if I just wrote an editorial it would just be a point of view but if I put numbers behind it and say it was a survey it'll seem like a fact but it's not a fact Atlanta is a great city and the fact that you want more of a gap between the rich and the poor\nYou want to be as wide as possible that's the most that's the best indication that you live in a wealthy city and also that if\nWell the you can move up about that I like it that was going to the ... around fire\nBecome a
