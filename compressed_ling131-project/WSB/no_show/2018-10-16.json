with all due respect and he won [laughter] you got it\nMy point is he lessons that affect the exact effect that that caller is calling about\nWhen he allows himself to get into a back and forth and then come off as defense if I thought he was making great points\nAbout Kavanaugh and then he says oh doesn't matter we won no that's not the reason why it does matter you won but your point should be it still does matter in terms of the mid term it matters in terms of the midterms kinda more I Would say in terms of the midterms but you get what I'm saying it matters\nIt will always matter that we found out\nThat there is a portion of this country that believes on certain issues you remove the presumption of innocence that's important after victory and so what I'm saying to this open Mike Orr is I think that he does well until he gets caught up in the back and forth then he gets defensive and then he says things that are just outright silly\nLike to Leslie stall I'm president and your not\nManny Manny Manny ... meaning\nRan a cut of apropos did not say since they didn't run as far as I Know\nWhen I was making ... than you did it for time I was telling you that you've seen in me much differently on the subject I disagree but I don't want to have that high but you may not if I were in the meantime I'm president and you're not\nJust say I'm when when I see somebody like Leslie stall being that combative I don't think that she shouldn't be that combative I think she should have been that combative\nWith Obama as well I don't think it should go the other way I think Trump thinks that he should be revered by the press or something because he's president I don't think it should go that way with blindingly obvious to me is the attitude of the interviewer\nWhen you change out the interviewee because on the interviewee was Obama we got questions in the press corps like ah what's been the most magical moment\nOf less knocked off money mostly like to do green yeah\nLeslie stall actually brought one reporter is supposed to bring the problem is they only bring it when they were reporting on and interviewing Republicans\nWhat's your favorite thing to order from the White House kitchen oh I must be a Democrat [laughter]\nLead at night uh I get hungry for murder so I'll say I give me a cheeseburger put all of making on that's so wonderful and I got a ... because she doesn't like me and all that bad but\nThat's where I stand the attitude Lesley Stahl brought last night no problem with it but it should apply to every president every politician but she interviews and that's just clearing we obvious that doesn't happen given the justice position between Obama and Trump and that goes through the whole press corps\nNow ever since the un came out with that climate report last week in Al Gore it's just been going all crazy about it oh the ... of\nThe ridiculous climate report that says if we don't do drastic things in the next twelve years it's the end of the

is through the state of Georgia are terrible at a certain amount of Florida was on the war but a long time ago\nIt sure was different than it is today\nYes Herrera famously was re was a rain forest for a while\nUh this is true what he says is true the climate does change the climate the idea that it just stayed in one thing forever and now you're not supposed to see a drastic change in your lifetime\nBut uh yeah I mean all people don't know that the Sahara was or wasn't rain forest there was a desert and then it was a rain forest than it was a desert again so things things change in this world they say um changes the only thing that stays the same once if you understand that about life\nYou will get over so much grief\nEspecially when you get into your like mid thirties\nLike autumn
