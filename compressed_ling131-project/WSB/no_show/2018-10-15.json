they're saying they can imagine\nHim he went went ... correct that the other side of this poll shows that the it's got the numbers for the Dems are that are likely to run and twenty twenty and Joe Biden has got a ... point lead over Bernie Sanders he's way ahead everybody thirty three percent\nI well good I mean if uh if if that's the if the Democrats thing that's the answer I think they're wrong uh I don't nobody is willing to say this but I've seen Joe Biden lately\nWhen he was speaking at the McCain's funeral and a couple of other sort of putting a toe in the water speeches for twenty twenty he doesn't sound good\nI mean I just lay it right on the table he sounds old slurry you know that's thing when you get to a certain age where the\nLips and the teeth don't work together [noise] mouth gets dry mouth gets dry maybe Seventy five years old now right now so you're talking about a guy that if the one would walk into the White House Seventy eight yeah thank goodness still younger than the stones [laughter]\nAmir baby [laughter]\nBut it's not a matter of what age you are it's what you project\nI don't think Biden about Biden is people forget he ran for president was a terrible candidate twice one time he had to leave for plagiarism\nThat was in the eighties so uh it's either in the eighties or Ninety two eighty eight whether they are so Biden has proven himself not to be a very good candidate and now he's a hundred so if the Democrats want to call their eggs in that basket I think that'd\nBe something not to mention Bernie Sanders is no young guy either right behind him but then you start getting\nThat but it's got that freshness of socialism [laughter] you know that makes you seem like a teenager when you're dumb enough to believe in social\nAs well then right after that it gets punched W Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren\n... even though they are all within like people don't really know who they are I mean Biden was vice president for eight years so\nJohn Kerry talking about possibly running against a lurch\nOne of these by maybe we'll come down with a nomination because what's gonna happen is you're going to have like the Republicans last time a million people will be running you're going to have all those debates with the you know eight nine ten people on stage and Bernie Sanders\nIs going to be sharing the message with Cory Booker Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren quite likely that if those four stick around\nFor a few months they could cannibal eyes that far left vote and so somebody seems more centrist like Biden\nCould possibly move up or that guy from Starbucks is he going to run our our ... I didn't even the polling\nIt might be that you could because the cannibal as each other over on the far left you may be able to emerge in the primaries\nAs a centrist but I don't think I used to think the Biden would give Trump of good run I don't I don't think that any more Hillary might even run again she's not going to get out or you're kidding me you think the Democrat yeah\nYou're ready to have a lot more vitality and me now I've been to my old we GYN why her scribes more testosterone [laughter] I've got a little bit more but my staff that much\nLike sixty six jello for you you really can keep going is it one of those\nOn energy out around she ain't got no well I heard that they're going to do that thing about rabbit they got nothing on me\nThey got a hum the don't on tour or did you hear this oh yeah a Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton are going on so she's been doing a lot of interviews and finally finally somebody ask her about her husband given all the Kavanaugh stuff going on and you think\nBill should've resigned in the wake of Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now\nNow now now although Kavanaugh we think that maybe somebody there's no evidence so he got really shouldn't have\nHundreds if not judges and dumb and turning colors no\nMatter what that interviewer was getting to the idea that is me too movement ideas which just totally uh the accepted\nA ... on the campuses of this country is that it's abuse of authority when you have authority over the female now let's put authority to gather here he's the most powerful person in the world president United States she's an intern\nYeah yeah hey I anyway no no making about running again let me think about that\nI think you're gonna have to hold your husband of the same standards you hold everyone else in this time of her story or ask the me too movement we've moved on if you go because of the world's moved on\nYou know we don't need to look bad word\nGetting off the stage\nFor how 'bout yelled at me down can you hold my hand and help you out of a very nice\nPhrase with you when you the the thought of having Hillary Clinton Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders leading that party I mean that just shows that there they certainly\nSomeone else can emerge should what was I mean it was Obama really even on the horizon at this part of the maybe just starting to emerge he'd given one really good speech at the at the prior a convention for the Democrats\nWell he was busy doing a lot of legislative stuff in this\n\nWhether or not he actually write a so ... and the and Bill Clinton I don't think he emerged until the following February March or so somebody could come along we don't know either a Democrat governors we've\nNever heard of what you said earlier in the segment was there were a ton of left he's running in Ninety to ... they all fell aside and he came out of no he was a hard to believe he was a centrist allegations against him from Jennifer flowers helped him\nYeah Clinton was a centrist a until the impeachment yeah and then when the impeachment came it was the Congressional Black caucus and other far left groups in government that actually stood with him so after impeachment his politics became more liberal but\nBefore impeachment he was actually pretty ... pretty especially for the Democratic party [noise] I mean they were considered a party that couldn't win the White House until\nHe came along [noise] 'cause he didn't alienate everybody that his wife alienated many years later [noise]\nTerrorists on Hitler entertaining honest independent thinkers timelines all new and find them on our doctrine daily podcast has the Haitian doctor and um [noise]\nA lot of Nineteen and the great barrier WSBIU twenty four hour traffic center still got that construction going on out there just west of bill or a guy twenty westbound past highway one Thirteen exit Nineteen that in the left lane you're seeing heavy delays out of ... might wanna jump up use highway Seventy eight as an alternate construction Jimmy Carter barred westbound it away boulevard that and they left lane\nSo only the right lane is open delays back toward west peach tree street and construction that peach tree road north bound right around borrowed that's in the right lane my only thing about north side Dr or Piedmont as your alternate Alex Williams W.
