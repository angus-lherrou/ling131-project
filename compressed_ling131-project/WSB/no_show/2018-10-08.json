those who made false statements about Brett Kavanaugh should be held liable\nA in a [laughter] does that mean\nUnder oath or does he\nMean a at the ballot box probably about a box you have that are his audio from the the rally oh I sure do he probably means that the ballot boxes and he's right you know like I I yesterday that there's this\nHer own oh from she break up the Beatles from her own is from Hawaii no one's ever heard of is senator before but\nShe's famous now because she was the one who told men to shut up so now she says that makes you famous\nIn America you told a segment of society that they should shut up and not take part in the biggest issue of the day and this made her famous rather than just being ... you know saying in the world completely heckled in ridiculed\nNow I Know oh yeah no that's right because when you do show that you should shut up and maybe get in the kitchen and make the than doing\nLook what's going on now see you're turning it on us I just find it amazing that somebody that's that's that's what makes you famous that's what makes bookers on a Sunday Morning shows how are you going to show you were the person the\nHadar oh did you bring up the Beatles\nI mean I Would be about that one and like I Believe me a bunch of group of men making music thinking they're better than Jesus Christ they need to sit down and shut down\nAs her own oh she would have broken up the Beatles had she had\nThe on the phone no\nEars are making the rounds on the Sunday shows\nConfirmation battle ... about the car packed full of ... over ... server that says has that coal preparing where people like judge Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court and every other court filing for life\nFirst of all is that court packing it's the way that it's done to people who in the elections get to decide who's going to be on the courts that's not court packing quarterbacking is what FDR tried to do and was stopped when he tried to add\nThree justices so he could get more than you wanted to put a lab and justice is on there that court packing so first of all you're not using a that properly or secondly you know I think that when a liberals need to understand that when liberals say Federalist Society\nThe audience tunes out as much as when people on the right to say a ...\n[laughter] sounds\nGood feels good not effective nobody cares nobody knows the federalist society is and after a Thirty Years' of about thirty five years eight years of hard for you on TALK radio and it turns out no one still has any idea who Lenski is so stop it on both sides go ahead\nAll right here's some Trump talking it a little bit more about the Democrats while he was rally in Kansas on Saturday I\nAnd thrown aside every notion of fairness and justice of the since the end of due process nobody seen anything like it [noise]\nHave a chance to just four weeks Duran do your verdict on the Democrats conduct at the ballot\nHow would you ever seen anything like it it's always a thing with you know and then seeing anything [laughter] I haven't you added Noone ever was fast and we need to make them pay back all you got to click is geo pay\nI think this is a smart move for the Republicans\nReally think they should nationalize the house elections you hear a lot about while all politics is local\nBut at this situation if they want the Trump hers to a really get out to the to the ballot box there no boxes anymore get out and vote [laughter]\nThat's about it [laughter]\nI'm anytime they allow you\nUh if the if the what I think that you have to in every house district\nThat I Would uh be showing footage of these just just these protests just people screaming people screaming and hollering getting into people's faces and screaming and screaming and saying that you\nDo you want to Disney or that he has a lot about throwing the keys to ah oh yeah he did a great line I'm just saying look I'm just telling you this is\nWhat the Republicans objectively should do if they want to or not lose as many seats in the house or maybe keep the majority you don't hand marriages\nDuring our son is [noise]\nAnd you don't use our two and a hang we left wing ma and that's\nAnd Superman [laughter] you know blow the mask off the Lone Ranger and yet I don't mess around with ...\n[laughter] or at least have deviated them\nThe or does he is good yeah he is [noise] when you added\n... [laughter] well it sounds like you say you don't give batches you in our eyes that mad you know look he's a tear to\nClosely we could\nYou don't hand marriages during our son and I thought it was badges we know staking his [laughter]\nNow that's the effective way to go I think people are freaked out by ... I think people are freaked out by what they see a whole segment of society the things it's okay to just to toss away the presumption of innocence I think that I think a lot of people will respond to that and also if you did vote for Trump\nI voted for the libertarian pot smoker Gary Johnson yeah that was his name thank you for reminding me ha ha but uh if you voted for Trump\nYou don't think what the display you saw in the last couple of weeks if that goes to the Dems and the house you don't think impeachment starts the next day do you think there's any reason or rationale by the way probably the best thing for the chances of Trump being reelected\nWould be that they lose the house\nAnd they spend a whole bunch of time trying to impeach him 'cause they don't have the numbers in the Senate they can't remove them they could impeach them if they had the numbers if they have the numbers in the house\nUm cause that's going to wake up the people who voted for Trump bright but the problem for the G O P right now is cabinet do to get in so people you hear a lot about the energy on the right still four weeks four weeks is a long time in politics and if you feel people tend\nTo vote when they're pissed you know when you're fat and happy you're feeling good if you if the president you voted for is there and you got the judges and things less likely to go out and vote so I don't know if this helps or hurts but certainly\nNationalizing the election is the way to go for the Republicans if they stand a chance because they're staring at history\nHistory says you you you ... usually lose seats for her story I'm Sorry\nHer story thank you miss Hirono her story [laughter] that's\nFinally dime you change the way to make it more feminine and we can better\nYou know what senator Geraldo
