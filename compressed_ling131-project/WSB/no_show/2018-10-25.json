Ayelet Cindy boat [laughter]\nNew York times nearly excuse me uh the failing\nFailing New York then we'll do they've got your back and destroyed their ... and we'll see they're reporting that Russia and China are eavesdropping on your calls President Trump and are there in order to gain information on you that could influence American policy no no no they that that is\nSo this is kind of strange I did not know this and I follow the news pretty closely because I'm a talk show host ws be about the south [laughter] welcome south brother I did not realize that a Trump has three cell phones\nAre two of them he's allowed ... uh the the the secret service to\nModify and secure them a little bit but not all the way and then there's one his own phone he will not let them touch it and uh so he just it's it's believable if he uses this one phone to talk to people that\nThe Chinese and the Russians could be tapping enough further in the story is the Chinese are listening to conversations\nI guess that he's having with people who are experts on China or whatever and so they try to do is they listen if you believe the story they listen to these conversations and then they try to get other people to get around that people he's talking to on the phone and give\nThey'll get pro China messages inside their heads that's pretty elaborate they may not be listening to ms they may just be looking at who is calling in getting that are from the Russian point of view I guess they're just listening and just for fun but\nI uh this is believable if he wasn't one of those things though right have to challenge to some of our listeners because you know that you would respond differently if the story was about Iraq Obama you would be saying how are\nYou know I just over in I mean this is not proper or he's gonna he's going to give away state secrets or could be blackmailed over certain information if you're a casual conversations I Know for a fact\nThat most of my listeners would respond that way if the only thing different about this story was the president was brought was ...\nDidn't Brock Obama have an issue with his blackberry right we actually when I first got to remember\nAn awful lot of a right wing I can you believe this guy he wants to ultimately he gave in though and I believe that they modified is black barriers to Iraq to the president has three cell phones and one of them apparently is not secure at all which doesn't seem like a good idea\nBut maybe you're one step ahead of them maybe your advising then should\nWe need is here regarding Jagger is to just you know we're not going to do it the ANC let them have then it'll take islands would they literally endings jet I care about is getting it'd be it'd have to deal with Kim jung in [laughter]\nAnd that to throw them off the field I'm off the hook up the scent that is what I'm looking more so in other sent out there and they're chanting [laughter] if I Wonder if now if he knows that he'll say at some point hello China\nEditor Gen hope you're living in a beer enjoying yourself as we get a little problem of the we had to get other people out there now for the\nNext story what are you typing you over there one checking to see what the market is because the ... stock market a terrible day yesterday and raised all twenty Eighteen games yeah but it appears to be up about two hundred and thirty five points that I'm seeing it\nWell yes so you don't know where it's going to go lately it's been so although we don't always up yesterday it was doing kind of okay until a afternoon and then boom six hundred points down and I guess that was the thing finally after the last couple of weeks\nThat says that basically you've a race to all of all the games that you've had throughout the year\nAnd here's the thing for me when it comes to Wall Street and the Dow Jones industrial\nI just don't get worked up about it anymore it just seems weird to me there's some kind of weird food to to all of
