was asking you what's the most\nPunishment whoever's setting out to use a suspicious packages to Trump's critics what's the most punishment they can get well after we fought about breaking news we ... we were not reporting that we\nHave those old host of federal statutes that's again doing this okay and just to give it a general statute that says when you're transport or mail something then you're generally basing ten years in jail unless you have a license still keep in mind if you have a license to transport are male though there are there are people in that business\nSo that's just ten years or just basically delivering the mail yourselves\nExactly so that's that's one of the statues then there's the postal statute that says if you do with intent to kill somebody you're based in Twenty years and if there was a death than you're facing life\nOr and then there's another federal such that says manufacturing that doesn't just sending and if you manufacture a bomb or explosive with an attempt to harm somebody or kill them then you get life in prison\nSo right there now so first thing that we have to we don't know yet is because we have conspiracy theorists like Tim Andrews here who believes that none of these bombs are working bombs\nThat they're just not too frightened and Tim Andrews who has this conspiracy by the IRS believes will be authorities are not telling us that for some ... some odd reason now let's say that there was no way these bombs could kill somebody\nYou're still looking at the terrorists and stuff right\nThere's still terrorizing buddy rather it goes off or not right\nThere's a there's a law on the bus called attempt right so if you're an inept bomb maker because you're too green at it and you don't know how to do it that you can still be that under the statute and still do Twenty years of life right even if it's not a working bomb\nNow uh what if you know that it's not a word well rounded up just incompetent that's a question of back\nBut if you really you know look at that how do you prove that well if you put that are\nFor the jury or say there's a Tim managers believes you crack these things open and there's candy insider said I Know there's no real bomb making material I Know but\nLook at the end up you know if it was just a waste of where we have laws against terrorize each\nOther people just by the way in Georgia you're busy Twenty years and ten thousand hours\nRight here in Georgia, Georgia I say there's you know for life without an ugly related yeah All right uh George I have one more question for you on the other side and then we'll do even more lives we will return [noise]\n\nYeah well you asked me about ... er Cox media group station [noise]\nAt one of those twenty four hour news weather and traffic\nDies and am seven fifty\nAsked me to us\nNow is eleven o'clock I'm Sabrina cupid live in the ... the twenty four hour news that are\nBreaking news from what you asked me twenty four hour news there is\nAn arrest has been made and connection to those suspicious packages mailed a prominent Democrat according to CNN so let's go now to CNN's Evan ...\nAnd they were able to see that there was a that that facility collects male or process as male to and from a specific part of the region of South Florida the Miami area so that was very very helpful and then the the forensics work what's that going on in in Quantico in New York\nOr to examine these packages to to to look at them the ones that did not know that had not been detonated by the bomb squad\nAnd with that they were able to put together a lot of clues says a lot of we're going to let we're going to learn it in the coming hours I expect a but this suspect now is in the in the custody of the FBI are going to talk to them they're going to try to see whether he can uh maybe explained himself a explained why he was doing this how he put it together there's a lot\nWhen you're out of town a Tim Andrews uh won't say it necessarily but he's a conspiracy theorists and uh he believes that uh we're going to find out that it was some kind of left wing plot to make right wing us look bad\nAnd if the course they arrest to a guy who's a who's pro Trump is then it'll be a fake pro Trump or that they put up\nThere you've already decided to elude as you've already decided\nYou know to accept whatever you're going to hear ... that's that's a good conspiracy theorist\nI think the key goes conspiracies alive it's important now before we go to even more headlines which is our wanted this time a short side is still here and I wanted to ask you about one more quick story in law where is this law school that has a started providing stress rooms\nFor ... over stressed law students is it\nA sin sexes that's at Texas Tech law school\nTexas Tech law school so I was reading this yesterday and I thought man\nSomeone like George side who went to law school the way that it was supposed to be done is it the idea behind law school to try to break you know try to I mean not necessarily try to break you but you only want the best to actually graduate or\nThrough I mean listen you know when you graduated law school and you want to feel that sort of battle tested feel yeah you've been through it all you survive not everybody survives\nAnd apparently there was a young or old law students now that I just want to be cuddled through uh uh some of these younger millennial lawyers I see that ah we just have to remind them not to call the judge dude [laughter]\nSame class of folk right since so but what it was provided\nThe theory behind it is is they say about seven percent of college students are depressed they say after your first year law school there's twenty seven percent or that or suffer from depression right out and buy your senior year and last\nDon't mind those boats by the way we're raising money for Jerry Lewis vary\nBy their senior year in law school it's almost forty years a law student suffer from depression\nOh okay but isn't most uh not walk yourself through go back in time to when you're you were your first year law school is it I Would imagine first of all people say depression there's a difference between depression and clinical depression\nLook at it not they're not the same thing so I don't know which one clinical depression that's a big big big deal yeah depression in general is don't you think that a lot of people get to law school and they didn't realize exactly how hard it was going to be and you wind up being kind of down for a while as you wonder whether or not you're going to be able to keep up or whether\nOr not to move your challenged on a daily basis there's an immense amount of reading you know there's performance aspects of it right you have to stand up in in class and perform and recite cases and argue with the professor who's battle tested\nSo now we're going to have soft law students or just say this\nWait a minute yeah it is like on the witness brown\nRoasters are burning incidents in the courtroom literally the lawyer [laughter]\nThis is just to give I could be doing anything else than being here with the stupid case there's more to life than studying right\nNow like hanging out with your friends and experiencing life ... she wants experience just sitting around with that he wants broader rape and the court judge you know water it's not a big deal [noise]\nWater\nIn Thailand\nTeaching scuba lessons right now I can be doing that but then I'm here in the courtroom class thing\n[laughter] that's your future but I Would say so let's say law school
