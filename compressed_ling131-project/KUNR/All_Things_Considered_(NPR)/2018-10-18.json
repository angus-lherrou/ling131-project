a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland that was a real shocker\nSimilar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they'd been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes\nThat should have destroyed any signs of life you know my thought was boy someone should fall hotel MIT [laughter] her wits and some colleagues did follow up\nAnd now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils\nA deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like or lack of a better word they ... they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life\nShe says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt a point and it's only going from the happen you know on at nine and a lot on on\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively\nFew scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR News\nLast word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR News [noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News\n\nI'm told

through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the port so pretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be well\nThe treasury UK treasuries made an estimate says what would happen in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock could cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red tape at the borders and that without to business costs\nWould make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market the potential for targets as well so the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years\nUK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit as akin to sort of an aircraft\nGradually losing hide you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person would be a poor taste and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if the u._k. leaves without a deal\nWell for the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European exposed so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's a mud and they won produces in France cop produces in German\nWhether it's um and they won produces in France cop produces in Germany\nUm you name it they ... they will be effective because you pay off the breaks it will become the biggest single export destinations for all the all the European Union countries but the point is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that the other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's a lot to be honest I I mean we all quite at the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's not a couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister does a deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive then negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail and that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always a

say\nI'm Sorry but what she had a company do when it makes him mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nLike really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... most late rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies and we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent\nOf the wrong kind of apology could decrease the revenues that went to two percent which we attempted apologies and involved with the commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better the future it it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future actually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do about the future and then the ... vote lead into better cars than maybe it's maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and that as a result the those people punished you but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm\nIn our data um [noise] so [laughter]\nI think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect\nSort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer sticks and so you know entering a relationship with the company was sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that actually might may ... bit was the message is sort of committed to do more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships thing that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know here's a box of chocolates right or here's your editors and flowers flowers and candy and he's always take\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nPeople don't always wanted to ask you this question how they do I was curious\nThe main ways change with that because all my friends and my family know that I study apologies than they would always are might be skeptical\nA study apologies than they would always ... I might be skeptical whenever I Apologize so I have to like go an extra mile to sort of sound like earnest and sincerely morsel because people are always was like oh you're just doing that because of

mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends\nBut he is a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package who invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two

herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly when working when I build\nRelationships on both sides of the aisle love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act she was also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump\nMost notably on immigration where she helped force a floor\nShe's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program and when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration\nAs a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally\nChiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years that's something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent maybe not even say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence and Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people for whom party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nDemocrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like Adams but many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey're calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderates

triple lays or super regionals as they refer to\nWho are booming who\nAre receiving the news of Sears demise or near demise with glee because if Sears is still doing business in in their facility\nThey're happy to take the space back these are malls with four five six acres in some cases\nThat are fully tentative and they're only limitation is available parking\nSo they're losing one
