more about tourism in Egypt for example it was again sort of a broad based initiative but she and that was her undertaking this awkward\nBecause her husband is known for his America First agenda for wanting to slash foreign aid and their shoes on a trip highlighting all the good that American foreign aid does was that awkward\nIt's that strange sort of juxtaposition between the first lady and what she does and the president and what he does write this is sort of like ...\nIn between the first lady and what she does and the president and what he does write this is sort of like raised

is doing and in spite of budget cuts just you know the idea is to help these countries get off of the need for our aid so certainly didn't feel awkward when we were there\nBut the head of time it was

topic on the agenda\nKanye West met for lunch today one topic on the agenda gun violence in Chicago west told Trump he opposes stop and frisk police tactics the president's ideas have different greatly from what reformers and local leaders are trying to do\nA different that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports Chicago's\nHad a rough few years in twenty sixteen murders jumped to the highest rate in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there has fallen some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nI Am director the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave to straighten it out on to straighten it out fast is no reason for what's going on there [noise]\nBut what that means it turns out it's opposition\nThe administration is filing a brief for the federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems\nLike Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk from says the widespread\nStop and frisk getting a potential criminals reduce crime\nThat conclusion is contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forums justifying their stopped which has led to fewer stops the administration believes the sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make cry\nThe administration believes that sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime words and that this new consent decree is more of the same But Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in really\nHadn't had any keep from them and Cal now\nMadigan is the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nOr if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they are getting out and therefore ... nothing\nShe regards the consent decree as unnecessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word of justice William loses stop and frisk\nHe's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing\nIt galls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nIf we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias racial bias has to be attacked but certain neighborhoods need more policing\nMany policing experts these days lament what they see as a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing\nIn Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric asked about it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed out at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously\nYou guys even in the stories acknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like have loving little mice chasing every time Donald Trump's that's awful\nYou you guys got to stop acting like a movie and little mice chasing every time Donald Trump said something it doesn't have any value\nTrump's opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the administration's brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but on Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real highlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers Martin ...

kind of training would they have had to handle a situation like this\nBoth of them in training for decades Alexei as accomplishment out for quite a while as you say was faced with experience Nick prior to being an astronaut was a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky um\nCosmonauts for quite a while as you say with space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut was a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launched\nAnyone working together for a couple of years we've ring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong and the way the crew behave there was so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to how Alexei ... was dealing with things bringing them both safely back to her\nWhen we've even excuse you could go on a mission like that again I mean I Can't imagine the psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused in professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kinda mad because they didn't get to go to space today you know a kind of\nLike gosh all that preparation and had the ... but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again going I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to\nTell it's going to be a a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of\nInformation people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem a manufacturing problem who knows then once you know that you can fix it then you can set a timeline if that's three months from now than no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe land and they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... talked to the space station it's sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home it's there they can come home anytime they want but if they are\nThey flew up in a different ... talked to the space station it's\nSort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want a by if they ... to come\nHome and they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated and I'm not sure that after a little while they start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them\nSo it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man so people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process\nComing up Chris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander at the international space station thank you very
