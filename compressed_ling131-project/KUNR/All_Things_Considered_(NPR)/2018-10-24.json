someone managed to buy every single combination of tickets to guarantee a win and this totally perplexed as the people who run the lottery system like ... visit him on TV shortly after\nThe very idea of starting over seven million dollars to buy all the shares a lottery just seems preposterous\nThe man behind the plan was to fall on Monday I tracked him down a couple of years ago the last time there was a big lottery jackpot [noise]\nHe was living on an island in the south Pacific von ...\nHe was living on an island in the south Pacific von ... hello hello Hi this is defined Mondo yeah\nHe

I'm a I'm In my early on fixed you lay among which was the tune of ... shoes\nHe decides the lottery is his way out he's a pretty natural ... so he goes to the library and he starts reading math paper aftermath paper and he realizes something about the lottery there that if he buys certain blocks of tickets in certain combination he can guarantee himself at least a second prize so we pools his money with three friends and he buys the tickets\nWe want Seventy two thousand seven hundred and they could easily which was about a TV is a\nGreat big score that was on your first try\nYeah he takes the money and he leaves Romania for Australia he finds more investors he raises more money enough to buy all the combinations of numbers for the bigger Australian lottery and he turns lottery winning into a business for a while\nYou know Syria I Won twelve times\nAustralia passes a law that block them from buying up all the tickets so he sets of sites on the big prizes in America he decides

Angeles Dodgers take on the Boston Red Sox any game one of the twenty Eighteen World Series to talk about this historic match yet we reached ESPN baseball analyst Jesse\nAbout this historic matches we reached ESPN baseball analyst Jessica Mendoza he Jessica book also today\nOkay so like just lay off the stage where this is a battle of the ... teams have these huge histories to the biggest fan bases how epic is this face off\nWhat's crazy also these two teams have not met in the world series since Nineteen sixteen and guess who pitched games too about game for the Boston Red Sox who the roof and everything now Babe Ruth you might have heard\nOf him and he's a hitter but he was pitching for the Boston Red Sox not the Yankees that's how far back these this go okay with the U.S and they matched up so it's it's also even though it's it's this historic\nMatchup it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball team somehow they missed each other when they both and in the world series it was never against each other so I Love the fact that it goes back historically but also it brings them to two thousand Eighteen\nSo was that was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart broken in this case the Dodgers got it torn out\nAnd there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games but it went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I've met with the scene in spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back in when the world series but really when you look at the field team is different because they wouldn't got many Machado\nI mean this is Ben they're often said or either he's at shortstop they lost Corey secret during the season so now they have a child and then really is there a case I Know it's not Clinton ... its Walker dealer so adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honestly one of the best picture that way\nClinton crushed shah it's Walker viewer so adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honestly one of the best picture that we've seen in the national lean they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what did they have going into this\nA hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series and Thirty years you know the red Sox have had\nA really positive that a lot of reasons to celebrate between the patriots and the red Sox but this gene is argument and one of the best regular season teams we have ever seen okay so they went\nAnd it was without a doubt they were the best thing that baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when at all no one cares about hey you want a hundred and eight games yeah you get an award you get a crowd\nYou don't get anything oh you get as you want a hundred and eight games yeah they were in the ... they are so good also but as we know in the postseason the best teams in always when you got to go out and play\n[noise] All right I Want your crystal ball Jessica how do you see the world series playing out who do you think is going to win\nDaughters ... and that's going to shock a lot of people because of the Boston Red Sox are the best team on paper there's nobody better love about the postseason transcend all of that talent pitching hitting I don't care throw the numbers out yet is redemption it's passion it's it's this fire\nThe Dodgers have because they lost in game seven last year and I believe

specialist Dr Bryan jewel director for renounced breast cancer center has over twenty five years of experience treating breast conditions and cancers from diagnosis through breast reconstruction and offering in office breast ultrasound\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should first say that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families\nBut it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification Z\nLike one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and their reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country of ... of miles from where the parents are and I would say over two hundred and forty five a number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody into us\nTwenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made\nThe agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life is over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definitely we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents had criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nThey very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we'll we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited\nYear old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThese people you has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents\nWe are the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very

prominent Republican candidates that includes incumbent US Senator Dean Heller gubernatorial candidate Adam lack salt\nAnd state senator Michael wrote person who's running for lieutenant governor and what your take on all day is\nOver the past couple of months we've reached down to the campaign several times in hopes of arranging is a dumb conversation with them\nAs a matter of fact I spent at least nine different requests to senator Heller campaign with another six intellect fault all of which have been ignored\nI Will say in an effort to be fair at least Michael rubber ... campaign

deciding to run for governor and you can hear the interview at K. U. N. R. dot org\nPaul and in all of your work and persistence trying to nail down these interviews you know what are you hearing from them\nYou know I Can't say that I'm surprised that we haven't heard from him it seems at this point however lack salt rubber center are fairly being fairly tight lipped when it comes to speaking with the media\nYou know and we're not the only ones well our request that seem to be a ignored outright senator however has refused to talk to others like the Nevada independent or which is a very reputable news organization that's doing some great work he's ...\nAll news organization that's doing some great work he's called them fake news and pay to play well some of the other candidates have gotten in trouble speaking to reporters in recent months ... Adam lax all created a bit of a stir when he said he was willing to look at changing the state's abortion laws he's also been tight lipped since allegations that he assaulted a police officer popped up last month\nEven if these candidates aren't speaking to the media it's important that we at least talk about where some of them stand so let's start with Dean Heller he's finding a very tight race against democratic congresswoman Jackie rose and what are some of the key issue there\nSome Dean Heller has been in Nevada politics since the nineties he was a state assemblyman then served as secretary of state for three terms even served in the U.S house for three terms before governor Brian Sandoval chose him to replace John Ensign in the Senate and twenty eleven\nAnd I and I tell you that to explain the Heller is a known entity here in the state and what's really interesting is that for a majority of that time he was widely considered a fairly moderate Republican\nIt's only been in the last few years that he's come under fire and a lot of that has to do with his ties to President Trump\nPut on most other issues he's been a pretty standard Republican he voted for the tax reform bill last year his website both that he's authored several bills aimed at protecting veterans upholding the second amendment limiting the size of that the federal government fairly Republican stuff\nHowever those aren't the big issues in this race it's health care and that's what his opponent Jacky Rosen and the Democrats are hammering him on and frankly he hasn't had the strongest record on that particular issue it's part of the reason many believe he's in trouble but at the end of the day it's also important to remember that Dean Heller has never lost an election in recent polling\nRemember that Dean Heller has never lost an election in recent polling has him in the lead at least slightly\nAt such ever to Adam lack salts who is also facing stiff opposition from Democrats steep lack ah what do you make of that race\nYou know we talk about Dean Heller being a known entity in the state the same really can't be said about ... he's a first term attorney general he doesn't really have a record to speak of besides that he previously served as a judge advocate general in the navy he's the grandson of probably the second most popular politician Nevada history Polack salt\nBut to get down to his politics lax Alda spouses is fairly conservative world view and his role as a G his office has filed a number of ... his brief or friend of the court briefs in several cases and other jurisdictions one of the most recent of which was in support of a Texas law that banned the most common type of abortion\nA lockdown has also come out as a strong opponent the commerce tax pass by lawmakers and twenty Fifteen to help bolster education funding\nAnd it's an opposition that has drawn some criticism from current governor Brian Sandoval Sanibel has refused to endorse lax all saying he wouldn't support someone who wants to undo perhaps his greatest achievement in his time as governor\nOn other issues like guns lax all it's been unwavering he declared the expanded gum background check past ... voters and twenty sixteen unenforceable he's been in favor of work for ... for Medicaid recipients so he's been a fairly conservative voice in Nevada politics at least in the time that he's been here\nAlthough grace the senior political reporter came in our Paul thanks for joining me\nYou that was K.
