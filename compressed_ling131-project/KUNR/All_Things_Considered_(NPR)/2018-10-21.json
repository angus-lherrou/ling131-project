Arabia confirmed the death of journalists Jamal ... turkey says it is continuing its investigation into the killing\nYesterday the Saudi Government abandoned its earlier claim that it had no idea what happened to your show gee he was last seen after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month\nTurkish investigators said he was killed inside the console it and that his body was mutilated the new Saudi version of events as a journalist was killed after a fight broke out between him an unnamed people inside the consulate NPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul\nThe Saturday acknowledgement ... died inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin ... they know that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings pretend days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to Istanbul the same day 'cause showed you arrived at the consulate\nThere are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body President Trump said he found the Saudi account of what happened credible he also said the fight an accidental death is just a theory that's being thrown out and he doesn't want to use arms sales to the Saudis as retribution\nWay out for a hundred and fifty million dollars a hundred and ten million of which is a military order but this is equipment and various things order from

those people are reported to be members of the Saudi royal family\nPeter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nDespite last night's revelations there are still many many questions about this whole episode including what possible go all the Saudis could have had and Turkey's role and all of this turkey has been a key source of both leaked in public information but as our next guest points out that country's human rights record is no better than Saudi Arabia is\nWhen did you hear more about all this so we called Anthony Cordesman he's with the center for Strategic and International Studies he's written widely and consulted with both the state department and the defense department and he's with us now from Washington DC is of course and thanks so much for talking with us advisor you pointed out that Turkey's human rights record\nIs no different or no better really than Saudi Arabia is when it comes to suppressing dissent suppressing a media criticism so first of all is it fair to assume that the details that we've been getting so far from the Turkish media and other sources came with the approval of the Turkish government if that's the case what's Turkey's role in this what's their agenda in this\nNo\nSupport for NPR comes from the station\nFrom Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff a new series from the creator of Mad Men starring John Slattery Amanda Pete Paul Riser and

learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive\nAnd from the sustaining members of this NPR station\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin in recent years the public has gotten more and more concerned about the deaths of citizens particularly unarmed citizens during police encounters\nIn a few minutes we're going to hear from a Texas lawmaker who's trying to address this by requiring that high school students take instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop but first we want to\nStretching on how to behave during a police traffic stop\nBut first we want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy\nOn October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office to NATO Coby was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him\nAccording to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy and then he was taser several times this Kobe later died at a hospital\nAnd it might have ended there without much public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella Kobe is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story and she's with us now from London with the Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions as my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds\nAnd it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it it has been shown that police officers are able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him um it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred\n[noise] but but you know to do that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds that sort of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were describing someone wouldn't you described those things you\nMight not have sampled do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as deeply as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\n... it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police\nTo to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well absolutely and I think\nHere you see the impact of intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and kind of the police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policies shouldn't be when you're dealing with someone who's clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the ...\nThat you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where ... privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issues of poverty that aren't as connected as she does mental health in certain areas and connected it she said race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who um shouted vote the root causes and story they needed to be told\nThat about a Kobe she's the sister of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county a sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nWe said earlier police conduct towards civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she must took it for her home and of course amplifying this is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately\nIn the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know I don't like that like [noise]\nAre you know\nRice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us my pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we have an overt presentation of African Americans and Latinos that ended up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement don't traffic stops and I guess for land do cats do is kind of the tip of iceberg for me\nIt's still end up kind of steel he's an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to at least to find a baby\nOr expectations of citizens and police officers at what's lost here is that people are thinking\nThe legislation just focus on citizens well it doesn't it doesn't just focus on our video a video camera so stage for additional course content for both the citizen and also police and police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the length of course is a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students to pick up to what appeared to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine\nThe American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose\nOf the video is as a primer if we need to go back and makes it makes it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we define behavior expectations of police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in it you'll get fat I Can't\nI Can't forgive me why is that irrelevant when they issued that used to spark your concern here is an African American man in an encounter with a person that looked like him if that's the source of the tens and why would you measure\nLet me ask this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that I Do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put their behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens know what their rights or I thought put it in schools and making it mandatory was a great place to put it also also driver's license courses\nAnd also the police department of police academies and by doing that you have a great deal of repetition and hopefully that repetition will ultimately save lives\nWell but the question I think some people might have is the question the conduct of the drivers or is the question the unconscious bias of the officers\nOthers combination of both how do we make certain that there is content that deals with that biased piece\nHow do we make certain that and police departments that they have psychological examinations that Fred out that I'm conscience buys or an instance is try to erase as best possible the buys ...

E. L. dot com\nAnd from the listeners who support this NPR station\n\nWas all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin we want to turn now\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin\nWe want to turn now to the conservative effort to remake the federal courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federalist society Israel and doing that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions which I knew about the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group targeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secrets and sign something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us is going to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how was it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this raised ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with it all expenses paid seminar but there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something the\n... probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise that whatever they learn will be used for and they're going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts kind of indoctrination a law clerk is an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties on to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat is a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThat yeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo there are all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities and sororities they all kind of create\nPipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they'd been particularly intentional at this\nUm creating a shadow\nIntentional at this um creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who condemned be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools to professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system\nAnd to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably find\nBut also to make them make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not funny\nAnd what does heritage say about this I Do know that when your piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey had been very close mouthed about it I tried them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to say who is paying for it you know their materials say the generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who those donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February they just issued a brief bland statement saying they were reevaluating it\n... which takes us to perhaps they may try to reconstitute\nIn saying they were reevaluating which suggests that perhaps they may try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely possible is that is that um attack he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be her\nFinally today we're going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds today we want to talk about how Hollywood is putting the opioid crisis front and center in one of the networks Bosnia shows and let me just say that we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day I cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premiere episode of the Roseanne ... this week that you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular Ninety show\nAfter its star Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the Connors which mere this week and and it we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just starting to prove it's got to be wrong\nWe when I could talk about so we called Sam ... he's the author of dreamland the true tale of America's opiate epidemic and he's joining us from Los Angeles via Skype sand things so much for joining us\nPleasure to be here myself and also joining us from NPR West in Culver City California is Jeff Yang he's a CNN contributor and columnist for the wall Street Journal online Jeff welcome back to you as well always welcome to be back and we're going to start with you because critics at very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoids\nPrint reaction some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoided some of the kind of tough social commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you see it\nYou know it's really interesting because anytime a sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black can and dark and a\nLooming in a lot of ways in our society there's a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances or that provide the inside right and the struggle case one of the things that was really strange to me is that one of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of\nRacist tweet that got her fired was that she was on Ambien at the time that\nThat you know medication and potentially lead to this behavioral change so there is a weird tension in some ways\nUh in in terms of what's on the screen and the reality of her behavior medicate or not in the real world as soon as our culture guide though what did you think of the episode just as briefly as yeah\nI Know it was it was actually I thought really fascinating I thought they did a really good job of a touching on the ways that people use humor sometimes to push back against the darkness and the presence of the absence of resent was was powerful so uh I I thought they did a pretty good job actually addressing it very difficult topic", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Reno", "day": "21"}
