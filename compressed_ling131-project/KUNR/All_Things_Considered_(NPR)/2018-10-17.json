think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae beauty woman being a first generation American being a veteran I think you know in in so many of those identities\nI think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry I water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would

Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman and especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way to\nThe Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we think of all the overall national landscape for future LTV tiki candidates as well do you know\nYeah I mean I can tell you or you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what Amelia discussed which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with it so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well\nTo those young people that are falling behind us I Want to thank\nThree of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire and Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and the million mark ... is running for state legislature in Montana\n... is running for Congress in Texas and the million mark ... is running for state legislature in Montana it was great talking with all of you pleasure pleasure to speak with all of you as well [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n\nI'm moving a is a sales executive of war crimes\nShe lost her family and for a time her freedom she found the courage to speak out about the atrocities against her now she has won a Nobel Peace prize a conversation with not ...\nFor the latest on the search for Jamal to show tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\nIt's coming up for this morning for nine right here on K U when are\nWe get support from first independent bank committed to providing business lending solutions and response of service first independent bank banking on accountability information that first independence and the dot com a division of western alliance bank and member F.

Wesleyan University says healthcare dominates congressional campaign it out pacing jobs taxes and immigration\nDemocrats had been laser focused on health care this year\nIs the mirror image of what we saw in past election cycles one fellow says Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats said largely quiet\nRegardless that's how Americans feel about the Affordable CARE Act there are provisions at it that are very popular once it became clear that those visions are in trouble I think that has sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it that cycle\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare\nVice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action says that could happen during the lame duck session even of Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans want the ability to finish the job they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away at Obamacare for example the administration has already relax regulations allowing stripped down insurance policies with reduced coverage\nThe president will still be in office in his administration will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful rag\nBut Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a majority in

you're listening to KU when our eighty eight point seven on the way at the top of the hour we're marketplace\nUp next the upcoming ballot includes questions six and initiative that would mandate the increase of production of energy from renewable energy sources in Nevada\nI reporter ... spoke with you on our associate professor of chemical engineering Charles core and now to talk about the state of renewable energy here in Nevada\nThings first can you tell me a little about the history of renewable energy in Nevada and what its current state is currently in the state\nSomething like I'm going to guess what's around sixty percent or so of our electrical power is generated from\nPower is generated from natural gas a little bit more from um coal we still have a little bit of coal here and the remainder is around twenty percent or so it was from a renewable so one form or another\nIf question six passes the renewable energy portfolio will be increased to fifty percent by twenty thirty what are the current standards right now\nSo the renewable portfolio standard um has changed quite a few times and each time a legislature meet every two years they seem to want to tweak it a little bit the the big picture has not changed uh the the expectation is that all energy produced in the state by the year twenty twenty five twenty five percent of that\nWill be produced from renewables or a combination of renewables an energy efficiency right now\nOr the standard for the year twenty Eighteen is twenty percent and we should be up to twenty five percent or in the next seven years\nHow much renewable energy desk Nevada produce as of today um and where does that energy go does it stay here in Nevada or dead as they get outsourced to states like California\nOr it it's in the neighborhood of several million\nI'm megawatt hours or I'm Sorry several million kilowatt hours a lot of the power that's produced in this state is exported in fact a lot of the recent solar farms that have come on line up come on line to provide renewable energy to other states with their own renewable portfolio is especially in California\nHow do we compare to other states when it comes to renewable energy do we have a better environment for renewable energy projects is it a worst environment\nI'm In for renewable energy projects is it a worst environment\nI I think it was around Nineteen Ninety seven or when we passed our first renewable portfolio standard Nevada was had a head of the country we were we had the number one leading a expectations for renewable energy\nAh right now are sort of in the middle of the pack because a bunch of other states have caught up with us\nNow I'm In terms of natural resources anybody who lives here knows that we've got an awful lot of sun uh we've got more son available than any other state in the country so the potential to produce a solar power is quite high and it's I'm certainly lots of room for growth\nWhat effects would cue six passing have won Nevada both energy wise and health wise or what's your professional opinion if the renewable portfolio standard increases to fifty percent that would be pretty exciting\nIn terms of the um the amount of greenhouse gases that at well in terms of reducing the impacts\nThat we as a society have in a releasing greenhouse gases that the impacts can range from production nitrogen oxides and ozone to ... a release of other kinds of particulates a or certainly the environmental impacts are pretty severe at the source of the fossil fuels\nOr whether it's by fracking or some other extraction method certainly those kind of practices probably are will have inevitably have to change a as a society continues to grow and evolve and we will continue to invest in cleaner technologies\nDr Cornell thank

considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say\nI'm Sorry but what should accompany do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith hosted the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou did this like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nThe study was partnered with over so we look at we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... most late rides there's about five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its broader we tested different kinds of apologies and we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent\nOf the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue so I went to two percent which we tested apologies and involved with the commitments to do better or or not what we thought about a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments you've been in the future\nBasically two or three months later these commitments to do better in the future actually backfired against the company I'm In part because you might commit to depend on the future and then the vitamins oh we didn't do better because then maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and that as a result those those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever had a good effect I'm\nNot in our data um [noise] so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect ... or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet it seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains that it works on script singer sticks and so you know entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what what ... what were the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there is no statistical difference between the different language to his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that she might may have backfired a bit was a message that sort of committed to do more in the future\nAbout ... ... it was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think dislike carries over into personal relationships things I Am so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for dinners ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know she was a box of chocolates right or you're the you're the owners and flowers oh eight flowers and candy things always take\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nWhen people thought always wanted to ask you this question Murphy do I'm curious I think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies than they would always are might be skeptical whenever I Apologize so I have to like go an extra mile to sort of sound

as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all into the United states so yeah that's awful\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same that border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use\nWhen founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nWhen they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices\nOfficer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation of less chaotic going forward\nWhile I think the federal government has to\nThat would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which has taken a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state the rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened\nNPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThe garage doors shaking it was like somebody's trying to get in and the inside door was shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought just hang in there and I save everything was going to be okay for\nLast doors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone the storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the ...\nHas gone the storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite a few gates is the former head of FEMA and a longtime urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I call it the old Florida is not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all the generational of Florida families many of them or just said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a goes down as you go further north and Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes on the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWe thought were damage to pretty much all types of construction\nBut the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we saw there was damage to pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of housing what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig ... gate has long believed the wind speed standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nAnd if you had that store back in and out particularly yet Michael back in is going to force a much higher when load warm it or the coast well in land based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now in the process of revising the state code and as a wedding recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David provide ... says understanding how to build resilience structures is just the first step\nWe know what can be done it has been proven that the researchers there it is a way that a computer cheese willing to adopt it or not\nRealtors home builders the insurance industry and many others will have a voice as Florida considers how to prepare the panhandle for the next storm like hurricane Michael ...

R. it's almost four thirty and national news is coming up in just a moment when our serves the following translator communities in Nevada suffering the translator\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nGreat thanks for having me\nWhy do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have racing it\nNo Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering when it assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but once and for fair admissions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents learn missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although there is going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans\nThe group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that's true at all clearly affirmative action has failed and at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial it was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think that a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at net in the context of race but again like I said\nMarried in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nGrades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to realizing admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks for having me she's a junior at Harvard
