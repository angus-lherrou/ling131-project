support this NPR station\n\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin we're going to return to a difficult and for some people and traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party\nAnd he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years palm Marines says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd Don ... is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr primary thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christine Blasey Ford testify about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that's what motivated me I Want\nYou want to write this piece after all these years yes that's what motivated me I watched her testimony\nAnd I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus uh the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar I did something that I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's gonna be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nYeah let me start by saying this was an unusual\nEvent for me because I never went to parties never and so I I don't even know why I went I I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kids came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window\nTo about ten of us went out there and I happened to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out\nAnd so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off\nAnd then he he he took her panties off and then he he pulled on his pants and he went on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumped up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside\nWe all just started\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside\nWe all just started to run\nYou also write that you and other boys with the party started touching another young woman who was\nAlso passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes\nLater a\nWas laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think that the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told it's your\nFault [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nA you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilty you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article uh you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us was that you said I wanted to tell the story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what our role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men talk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard\nPeople say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long I I\nI I don't know why we've kept quiet\nA quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder\nThe man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't say I don't I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent on this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it [noise]\nHow did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] [noise] well [laughter] let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rape part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that for this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good and how did you explain that to your boys well\nJust I was truthful with them and uh they were very receptive on their dad you know that can you know we we kinda can't do too much wrong in the in the eyes of our kids\nAre they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it would happen now and he said everybody at that window would have had their phones al videotaping it that's what they told me\nBut that doesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they yeah I mean but in that sense that kid wouldn't have done it because you wouldn't have wanted to be\nOn film you say well we film everything you know what they would kind of alluding to\nWell how do you feel now but you got it off your chest\nYou know [laughter] and I have mixed feelings I'll be honest there there are days when I regret it and then the other day\nI'll be honest here or there are days when I regret\nIt and then there are days that\nI'm Glad I did you know my\nKids showed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time someone ... it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit this a lot of women ah said ah they were glad I did it they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a\nSalted who wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you know\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say the only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help\nUh you know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if I were to help these women then but I didn't do it Don ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years that have been many disturbing stories involving male athletes and the women in their lives
