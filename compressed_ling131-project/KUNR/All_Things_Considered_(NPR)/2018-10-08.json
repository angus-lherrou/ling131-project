are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican\nYou are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican Republic where same sex marriage is not recognized how did you navigate that\nSo as we were going my husband had to go as a family member not as a spouse we were able to change his status eventually to be a member of household but we never saw him known as a spouse or as a spouse as other\nDiplomats have on on their schedule is our main objective was to make sure that he had the fool immunities though that a spouse has and we were able to get that but he was never recognized completely as other spouses were and there was much discrimination based on that\nCan can you just give me an example of that\nSure I mean the first thing that happened to us when we first arrived was that the papal noon CEO who is the diplomatic representative of\nThe Vatican informed me that my husband\nBecause he was not recognized officially as a spouse or would not be invited to the reception of the diplomatic corps which he was leading for the reading of the president and the first flight of the Dominican Republic because of that non recognition as a spouse or and so that was just one of many examples where we had to fight\nTo make sure that to my husband was given the same privileges when it came to social aspects as well as legal aspects\nThis new position by the state department is a reversal of policy that had been in place since two thousand nine under secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nThe state department allowed same sex domestic partners to qualify for dependent these is now the Trump Administration says as as I said earlier that this is to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that comprise two different genders how do you respond to that\nWell I say it's one of two things one it's either during apt and really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have or to the district discrimination which is\nSix of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have\nOr to the district discrimination which is what I think it is from this administration and the reason that it's different is after August filled\nThat was the central that landmark ruling the Supreme Court that recognized marriage and all fifty states so that same sex couples who now legal it could be married in the U. S. throughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different\nThis is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation\nYou know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage but you're you're not allowing that person who was a great representative for the United nations or another international organization\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of these families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president's say there's many countries were denying these is from\nThe other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa so it creates a hardship and so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guarantee that they're going to get these are the only way that would be guaranteed is if they go through\nSomehow and figure out how to get married in another country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat is James Wiley Brewster he was in ... to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand Seventeen he's currently a principal at the consulting firm insignia global ambassador thank you so much for talking to us\nWell it's such a pleasure to speak with you and I wish you to have the best days\nNow to our series on China's growing influence in the world that influences felt particularly strongly in Latin America where Chinese investments are growing rapidly it's often said that Brazil provides the suit on China's dinner tables from soybeans to beef and chicken those exports helped make China Brazil's biggest trading partner\nTo beef and chicken those expert helped make China Brazil's biggest trading partner as NPR's Philip Reeves reports Brazil also has something else the Chinese want [noise]\nYou see this every way [noise]\nMen playing soccer under will often in some look again and you'll notice that something different about this ... we're in Brazil get all the players Chinese teenagers who've come here eleven thousand miles from home to pursue a dream\nMy dream is is if you go I Want to go to the my country to him in China\nThey work up in my mid ...\nPi I'm In ... up anti is Seventeen he's here to learn how to make it to the top in professional soccer or football as everyone here calls and he's glad he came in\nI think I like the brother of all I Want the plane here because a step by step here for for me is good I Want to make a professional player so everything is important [noise]\n\nWe just saw a training academy near a town called ... took place in southeast Brazil\nIt's part of the minor league Brazilian club called ...

News I'm Michelle Martin police violence and misconduct is in the news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of the teenager outlook on McDonald's\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nThe violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted Maria haven't felt she is a professor police science\nAt John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me you know what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there has been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's suddenly what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent it's significant that ... percent but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about for the something off he says investors said this something of stuff\nSo from my perspective it's really what Dr phil fan there why this police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what that I often there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some turn that we as ...\nSara Lee always know whether it's some trends that we are seeing that these\nDangerous and disturbing I Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily it's used to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most recent years we're looking more of them will she is a police officer in meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity um whereas I handling you know peasants with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations and ... no longer be\nThe most frequent reasons I'm for this\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it as it were\nNot people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to oppress the police are biased or racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn general the climate on in the last few years since ... on the police in the United states so when when you put the two together the propensity towards\nViolent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus a triggering event then you have the the other stuff out so if somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea than the steps of a Supreme Court\nYou'd think police officers pushing that\nDemonstrate to us so somebody looking at police officers identify\nThe demonstrators so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this ... this thought that the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because you cannot take you out and get out to be on a given police station instead you you're doing it against the Soviet prevent the tip of the government was a police officer\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians often the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us\n... when we looking both on the investigative enforcement um death and the ones that are that part of the ... the activities is definitely a training issue office so frequently\nA seat in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that ah\nIt's always a reasonable thing to do given the as particular environment and given that said and political development that might be putting their lives in danger so this tactical issue is\nHow you approach and the problem and how you go to the house\nAh well you know that it's a fast but who is armed and dangerous but I mean we have Eighteen thousand police agencies and when you have Eighteen thousand police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment stand up for training\nWhich would help us mitigate the negative perception of of policing is a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more\nThere was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable\nThat nine officers in one year are killed in that line of duty as an outcome of ... that was directed against them explicitly no democratic society should accept to nine police office in one yeah in separate incidents killed by members of the ... can accept\nThat as Maria have are felt she is a professor in the department of

surprise me anymore [laughter] really a surprise tell me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because ah for the last few years there has kind of been a steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment\nAnd she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram posed with really link the almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people that would really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nKind of his movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so [laughter] they kind of had read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nIn some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now Herzog with her being played on pop radio\nOf the country music industry now Herzog with her being played on pop radio and she'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has his country than she did still want to appeal to them but I think she probably didn't feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what'd you think is going on with her\nAnd now this is what I've been trying isn't the mystery of the day\nAnd [laughter] I always had that I had her mind for mislead Beckley\nTaylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of looted and her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nAnd like she didn't say but those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most was her sexual assault trial when it kind of music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet line\nAnd she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really

Chang and you climate report commissioned by the United nation paints up pretty dire picture for the year twenty forty\nHigh food shortages wildfires droughts rising sea levels poverty and massive destruction to coral reefs previous research predicted these effects if the earthworms by two degrees Celsius\nBut this report finds the consequences could actually come much sooner when the earthworms by one and a half degrees Celsius which is on track to happen in just about Twenty years\nThe un included data from over six thousand scientific studies\nAnd one of those studies came from the nonprofit think tank climate interactive where Andrew Jones is the cofounder welcome thank you thank you also still just make this clear this report is predicting really the same consequences of climate change that previous reports had been predicting but this report says the consequences will happen sooner yeah\nThat's the basic idea and when I read it for the first time I was struck with the urgency and they really laid out with such precision the hearing now element of this problem and not do it for the grandkids so many of these effects that you just mentioned it around\nSo many of these effects that you just mentioned hit around twenty forty also I think you and I plan to be here around twenty I order and they do yeah so this is a kind of hearing now impacts at the scientists were writing about\nSo what would it take to avert this I mean there's report is saying we basically have a deadline coming up in about Twenty years are are real changes feasible within that timeframe absolutely like this you\nHear some of those studies ... it makes you think\nGosh I just want to hide under the covers and\nWatched the Netflix series but if you think about it facing this kind of impossibility is really some extent what humans\nWere made for and the report lays out really well if we're willing to take on the kind of efforts that we've had in the past and humans have done it also and in World War two\nFlying to the moon yeah rebuilding Europe after the plague took out of the\nLos Angeles actually when I was gonna point out you wrote an op ed in the New York times the other day and what you compared to seemingly insurmountable task of confronting climate change to\nTo things like winning World War two or achieving civil rights but was that supposed to be reassuring because you do make the challenge seem awfully daunting\n[laughter] well it is daunting and we get to kind of remember our humanity and what we have pulled off in the past these amazing things where humans have faced impossibility and the scientific report laid out really well what we get to do\nAnd it's no silver bullet it is this mix of\nClean energy and wind and solar and pricing carbon energy efficiency men walkable bike ... communities plants\nFish and sea men walkable bike ... communities plant based diet it's that kind of all across the board no silver bullet but silver\nBuckshot all of these actions together so this is the big challenging and World War two task in front of us I think we're up to it and the report says if we did it all we could technically\nReached that goal of limiting warming to one point five degrees but but that raises the question of a political will as you said is it just requires buck shot and all different directions but President Trump has withdrawn to us from the Paris accord the front runner in Brazil's election says if he wins he will do the same\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from log me in makers of go to meeting a collaborative meeting platform with over Eighteen million monthly users designed to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device learn more it go to meeting dot com [noise]\nFrom exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening test that can be used at home by prescription only information a color guard test dot com\nAnd from the listeners who support this NPR station from\nNPR News this is all things considered ...

for NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia [noise]\nIt's time now for all tech considered\n\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the weight technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually\nTechnology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure or is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it\nWas there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed white or use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when illumination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that you know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it miss identifies white people are there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological\nGorillas I'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why\nDo mistakes like that happen [noise] yeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races so you're saying\nThere are just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color yes oh\nThe answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a\nHarder question so even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use this technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters as someone who really understands\nThis science is today how do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility is something that uh\nTechnology outweighs its utility is something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you [noise]\nOf course for
