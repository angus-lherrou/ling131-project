depends on Wendy FBI concludes its investigation into claims that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when they were both teenagers Kavanaugh ... denies the claims\nThe scope of the investigation is unclear and has been the subject of political haggling ever since the inquiry was announced on friday NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is here in the studio to walk us through the latest I've got a good afternoon let's start at the White House President Trump held another one of those extended unfiltered press conferences today what did he say about having on this investigation stance\nIs it a lot about cabinet but let's just focus for this moment on what he said about the investigation and cabin uh we've been hearing a lot of reports that the

according to the senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority I Want them to do that\nAnd we do know there's been a lot of conversation between the White House and Senate Republicans about

weekend to ABC News he said that would involve all the witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford said we're at the party\nAnd it also includes Deborah Ramirez who made that second claim that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a college party here's the thing that's unclear whether the FBI could or would broaden and talk to college classmates who have come forward saying that cabinet wasn't telling the truth when he testified about his drinking habits and other things like that\n... was in Boston today here's what he said about what he wants the scope to be\nThat does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out where we can find out\nAt the same time though a Senate Republican leaders are moving forward you've seen them and the White House stepped up their efforts to play up the evidence that undermines what what Ford said and backs with Kavanaugh said and that includes a memo from that prosecutor who did the Republican questioning last week Rachel Mitchell\nSaying that based on the lack of hard evidence a reasonable ... prosecutor would not bring this case against Kavanaugh\nAt this point how much control does the White House and Senate Republican leaders actually have over this process\nWell here's what we know we know that they didn't want to be in this position they didn't want to even have a hearing and they wanted to have a vote as soon as today or tomorrow on Kavanaugh's confirmation they didn't do either of those things because a flake and the other Republicans who are on the fence said we're just not comfortable moving forward with this\nAnd you have to wait for those votes those three Republicans have a lot of power right now and that's why this moment in a sixty minutes interview was so

to walk us through what this means for Internet users like us Hayley not high remind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going

the massive liberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nA the the writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then

currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies\nUm including immigration admission standards and often when California sets a standard many companies look around

these remarks interpretations of them NPR's Tamara Keith is here Hi town hello Ari [noise] going to begin with Kevin I was first public comments about his drinking\nYes that was a Fox News interview that he did with Martha ... this was before the hearing he started by describing his high school life in this way\nI went to an all boys Catholic high school in Jesuit high school world's focus on academics and athletics going to church every Sunday at little flower a wartime I service projects and friendship\nHe did mention the other parts of it the the partying\nAnd you ask people might have had too many beers on occasion and people generally in high school or the goal of us are probably done things we look back on and high school and regret or cringe a bit but I that's not what we're talking about\nYou can come away from most of that interview thinking\nHere's someone who was really studious and didn't really have time for that much partying um but he was asked in the interview by Martha ... whether he ever drink so much that he couldn't remember the night before no ah that never happened never sent anyone I don't remember anything about last night no\nSo that's the description who gave Fox News several days\nYou know so that's the description he gave Fox News several days later he spoke to the Senate Judiciary committee under oath and here's what he said in his opening statement\nI drank beer with my friends almost everyone did sometimes I had too many beers sometimes others did\nLiked beer I still like beer but I did not drink beer to the point of watching out and I never sexually assaulted anyone\nAnd that set the stage for many hours of conversation between Kevin on senators about beer\nYes there were probably two dozen references to beer during the hearing and senators asked about it on a number of occasions including as Senator Sheldon Whitehouse who is a Democrat and asked cabinet about your book in trees where he referenced a Ralph club\nYou know I got a weak stomach whether it's with beer or with spicy food or anything so\nThe vomiting that you reference in the rough club reference I'm related to the consumption of alcohol\nRight now in Truckee

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro\nJason Kander a Missouri politician seen as a rising star in the Democratic party and the favorite in the Kansas City mayors race is dropping out\nCandor is a veteran who served in Afghanistan and today he said he's bowing out of the race in order to seek treatment for his P. T. S. D. and depression and parents Lawrence covers veterans and the VA and he joins us now like well how are they tell us more about Jason Kander a Democrat with deep appeal in a deep red state\nRight a he's a lawyer he was a former Missouri secretary of state he did a tour in Afghanistan as an intelligence officer\nBack in two thousand six and then came home and got into Missouri politics he made a surprisingly good run in the deep red state to unseat Republican senator Roy Blunt in two thousand uh sixteen and if you've heard of him you've probably heard of him from this ad on Jason Kansas\nSenator blunt and he's in an empty warehouse blindfolded and he's assembling a are Fifteen style rifle and the while he's doing he's talking about gun rights and he says he supports gun ... supports gun rights but he also support background checks\nHe says to keep terrorists from getting one of these\nAnd then the gun is assembled and he takes off the blindfold and he says he's I'd like to see some of the foreign do this and the ads on national attention he later had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really\nIt seemed like a rising politician the Democratic party\nAnd his decision today to part of the race came as a surprise and I came with a very honest and emotional let her message a tell us about it\nIt was just hours ago candor posted a statement that he was tired\nRight it was just hours ago candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem or that he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating for example a having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in a in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had been having suicidal thoughts\nUm so he decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and from the organization who started something called the let America vote which is a anti gerrymandering an anti voter suppression organization or he says he's getting VIP treatment\nAnd that he's not permanently retiring from politics he's expecting to be back\nEven with all of a conversation about and support for people who have ... how much stigma is there still today\nWell I mean there's a lot of stigma and and it can also depend for example on what stage are out in the military career if you're active duty military and you raise your hand and get treatment it can make you under deployable so a lot a lot of people will hide it because they want to be able to stay in the fight\n'em and um [noise] I mean I Can't think of a politician who disclosed this sort of thing except\nUsually on the you know on the tail of a scandal that's going to come out involving some uh misbehavior but uh I mean this is a serious crisis just last week the VA release statistic saying that suicide has increased especially among ... generation of veterans and\nCandor said he wanted to do this in part to help others confront this in public that it isn't a sign of weakness\nThat some parents Quil Lawrence thanks ... thank you Ari\nWeakness some parents ... thank you Ari now we turn to Amazon which has become the largest company to commit to the minimum wage of five Fifteen dollars an hour\nThe retail giant which is where it's almost a trillion dollars faced a lot of criticism after disclosing earlier this here that uh meaning salary at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars that's just a little over the federal poverty level for a family of four NPR's Alina Selyukh reports\nAnd Amazon corporate executives stood today before and more than\nSeven hundred workers in California warehouse and told them they are getting a raise [noise]\nThe Dave\nClark he told me this was one of his best days at work and the Twenty years it's been at Amazon I should note that Amazon is one of NPR's sponsors I reached Clark adds that California warehouse\nOut now is a Fifteen dollar minimum before any other\nThe Fifteen dollar minimum kicks in on November first for all Amazon workers in the U.S fulltime part-time temps in seasonal Amazon says that's about three hundred and fifty thousand employees total I asked Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon now\nAre lower in a facility was under lemon dollar ranges over Fifteen dollars\nWas all ready far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cents but still Amazon's bay has been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers and warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable\nWarehouse workers Amazon is the second most valuable American Company it's run by the wealthiest men in the world CEO Jeff ... [noise]\n\nTwo weeks ago a group demonstrated outside of the speech in Washington protesting the wide gap between basis as well and the wages for his lowest paid employees\nInside ... spoke to several hundred Washington Power brokers and he was asked about the growing intention that Amazon was getting from critics who think it's become too big and too powerful Caesars said scrutiny like that is good for society\nAll big institutions of any kind or going to be and should be examined scrutinized inspector\nToday in his statement about the Fifteen dollar minimum wage ... said the company listened to its critics one of the most high profile ones has been Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\nFor her to give credit where credit's going to make a big deal but I Do the right\nSanders has long been campaigning for better conditions and pay for minimum wage workers including at retail and fast food restaurants\nHe has introduced a bill called the ... act which stands for stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies the bill would tax large corporations whose workers rely on federal benefits like food stamps\nAnd our hope and believe that I'm On the computer will cause other companies like Wal Mart for food in reading which was world so to get there for American workers\nIs not the first big retailer to make a public show of raising the minimum wage target plans to get to Fifteen dollars an hour by twenty twenty Costco hit fourteen dollars this summer but Amazon is now the ...\nGo ahead fourteen dollars this summer but Amazon is now the country's second largest private employer\nI thought it was great news I don't see how could be other than good news\nIs the author is an economist at MIT and he says there are several ways to view Amazon's move skeptically won the unemployment rate is low and there is high demand for workers\nOne interpretation is look it was going to have to raise wages anyway Italy marketers tightening uh so it just you know decide to get some good publicity out of that\nAutor says no matter the reason it's important to remember that raises are good for the workers who get them their local economies lower wage workers are so they do tend to spend extra earnings\nAnd there's another kind of surprising way that Amazon made waste today it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal minimum wage however Amazon's Dave Clark told me the company does not plan to push for a federal minimum all the way up to Fifteen dollars\nWe think of the right number for relieving for Congress\nBut Senator Sanders says

outside in his car to provide protection twice Madison was sentenced to death but the conviction\nProtection twice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct the third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dimension\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this prime things about the state to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the results of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that\nProducing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor so you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet and his cell for his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely urinate on himself and asked the guards to take him to the toilet [noise]\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendments it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable\nThat executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's schizophrenia or delusional\nLawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible\nCrime and he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murdered after the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder\nAnd at some point in time to say look forward to being able to obtain punished with with the trial judge believe was appropriate in this case\nA
