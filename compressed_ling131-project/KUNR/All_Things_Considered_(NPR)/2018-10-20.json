he is dead ... had been missing since October second that's when he was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Seventeen Days ago\nMultiple news reports had pointed to his likely death but this marks the first official confirmation NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me now from Istanbul Hi Peter I'm Mary Louise what details do we have from the Saudi announcement\nVery few details of the Saudi press agency is saying Eighteen people have been arrested as the investigation is ongoing or but as you mentioned there is the first official confirmation\nOr from Riyadh the drum up to show gee uh is did he was last seen going into the Saudi consulate here in Istanbul on October ... seconds\nAnd according to the Saudi press agency after he entered the consulate there was a fight to dispute that broke out and that led to his death we we don't know any more details on that right now\n[noise] Saturday TV is reporting you mentioned Eighteen Saudi nationals arrested 'em and among them they also mentioned a general and a royal court advisor who've been sacked from their position was do we know who these people are are any details about them\nWell a major general Ahmed Asiri was first mentioned uh to my knowledge in a New York times report this morning that talked about him as someone who might be being lined up to take the blame for this a lot of questions have been pointing\nAnd who might be being lined up to take the blame for this a lot of questions have been pointing of course at the royal family including a crown prince Mohammed bin some on as the man who was in pretty much total control of Saudi Arabia\nAnd of many folks have been saying that this probably could not have happened without his knowledge and possibly without his order\nA but at this point the Saudis are saying that this intelligence officer and advisor to some on a has been sacked and also son could Tony who's an advisor\nTo the world court so possibly a strategy to to uh put some scapegoats out there and the questions were made in terms of who was giving the orders for this operation let me ask you this Peter what do we know about timing why put this out in the middle of that they're from Saudi Arabia\nI Can't answer that really um there have been a accelerating investigation certainly and the pressure has been growing ah after initially uh being rather cool to the whole idea of President Trump has been\nA saying there will be severe punishment if the Saudis are found to have been behind this and it seems as if there is a move in Riyadh no or to move ahead with this and not continue with their initial statement which seemed to be more and more untenable\nI Am going to the Saudis statement tonight explain in any way how what they're saying now is completely different from what they were saying two weeks ago\nThat's not explained a but it is completely different the original explanation has been um he walked into the constantly as he needed some paperwork he walked out within an hour and we don't know what happened to him that has been the official on the record deposition ever since this happened on October second\nMid sixties for the high Seventy to the high for

News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Washington and I melted Chang in Phoenix, Arizona President Trump\nPresident Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now\nBoth of US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they're all Republican but that could change because waves of Latino will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state and to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino\nGuy\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out got as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who gives a Republican somehow\nThe way we handle our home especially in Hispanic community is the way Trump wants to run the U.S [noise]\nRamon Baron owns a small business repairing floors he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump stands\nSecurity order you know you need certain order and in your home you know the issues that came with the wall\nYou know building a wall of the good it is a good idea because I just installed not even two weeks ago a security door on my door already have a door but I Would have better door when you're ... arrow son he's fourteen years old\nAnd it's funny that he told me somehow the door makes me feel safer\nIt made me think you know that you know it does make sense more more metal barricades\nIt doesn't make sense more more metal their keeps\nThat war people out you know\nStep outside and within seconds you'll run into people who beat him mainly just agree with parents like Abel Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news or coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a ... status you've seen the kid's been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party he asked me\nI mean who's solving all that you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is no reason Hernandez view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJuices Garcia hits the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty Eighteen could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen [noise]\nAnd not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district state representative Tony Rivera [noise] have any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say well they'll say um\nThey'll have give me a hard time like well what did they say well they'll say um how could you be a Republican and when the Republicans don't support 'em Hispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd his response to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latino face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around or there is district as he knocked on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some time I was telling you they're almost the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the ... that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWell when they know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in ... parents are from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go sideways with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and opportunity I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this\nIncrease the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back he's still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection aj Doug ... on the ballot at its Doug do she's agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as you approach doozy for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies that\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them when you to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans\nNot one says he said that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am belching for Doug juice\nBut under that logic it Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him a truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThey see what's going on to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to go to ... vote and they said that we were ready to go over there and\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republican to separate themselves from the broader party governor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President\nTrump did [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nNew is shouting ties we take a closer look here's the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of ... was

at the end of the day we have to remember that ... is not just a columnist for the Washington Post but he was also a personal friend of some uh bin Laden\nAnd was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood this is an individual you know\nWe have to take all that into account and I also think that when you are dealing when he was ... a journalist for the Washington Post and who was a U.S resident and do it now appears was murdered I Know the ... I and of course we do have an interest in making sure that us permanent residents are protected as well that's something that we're interested in doing\nUm when you are talking about the middle east we are talking about a lot of bad\nActors here I mean if we don't if we're not willing to work with Saudi Arabia\nThe other options are not so great either right we have turkey which tells the highest number of journalists anywhere in the world we have\nIran we have a number of uh other countries that committed human rights atrocity is just on the regular so I think that we just really need to get all of our ducks in a row and we need to you know maybe not necessarily change in one fell swoop our entire Middle East strategy over this quota joined it\nReally disturbing to go back to his youth this person who has been a as close and the broader sense of the word liberal\nIn terms of demanding greater freedom in the middle east to go back to his youth and tar him as a young member of the Muslim Brotherhood I think this is this is a former propaganda ... that can be is being used\nYouth and tore him as a young member of the Muslim Brotherhood I think this is\nThis is a form of propaganda ... that can be is being used to kind of justify us off line here people should read his final piece for the Washington Post which was really powerful call for freedom in the Arab world\nThat was really a red white and blue sort of column and that's all he has been in that is the man who was killed\nLet me ask you both to set aside for the moment questions about whether his past\nIs relevant has passed before he became a journalist and came to the U. S. and focus on this question of does this represent a diplomatic crisis for the United states with a Saudi Arabia which has been a strong ally for generations free\nI think that Saudi Arabia is aware that they really messed up here um you know they've arrested I think it was Fifteen people in the last hour they announced that they've arrested and dismiss five others\nSo that he may have eight to ... to statement from Saudi state TV yeah so I think it's clear that they're taking it seriously and they should be taking it seriously\nUm I think that they definitely need to you know rethink what they're doing and the way that they are going to treat American permanent residents that are living in their country\nEJ a last word to use thoughts on the were this leaves the U.S Saudi relationship going forward\nI think the relationship is in crisis I think the comments from some of the Republicans in Congress or suggest that as well as a Democrat and I think it's fundamentally put to bed this notion that Mohammed bin some some on M. B. S. as he is known a crown\nFriends for the room\nIn an hour or ... or former ah I think this has really brought home the sides of his regime or that or repressive his image will never be the same as

wood from his old garage door to build the first little library at his home in Hudson, Wisconsin now there are tens of thousands of little libraries in eighty five countries\nAuthor Miranda Paul got to know Todd ball and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library in the first place\nTodd mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled\nHis mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her and was it a hit right from the start actually know very little passed by\nStart actually know very little test by that he talked with his friend Rick Brooks and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effect shift a little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always is amazes me is the only people hugged them when we actually put the myth we constantly did emails that I've met more people haven't Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people from the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories\nAs a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he was about projects especially those that had to do with the news or people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries has come up as sort of a little spring of hope\nAlong the U.S Mexico border there's a hundred and fifty of them on in prisons in Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda at a hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and brought communities together\nPeople of course take books from libraries but you also get to leave them\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to see that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and that all you know when I'm Out jogging whenever the next day seeing if somebody's taking it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else who's going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car so that when I'm going somewhere if I see a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I went in there so much more to what he's doing and being a champion for books or for reading he was being a champion for communities new friendships new ideas new projects springing to life
