when he went to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia he said explicitly we're not here to lecture we're not here to tell other people how to live what to do who'd be or how to worship\nAnd that statement sets

who has picked up President Trump's phrase allergy about fake news and it's also engaged in a raft of extrajudicial killings of political opponents as well as of drug dealers\nThere was a lot of reason to be concerned that when President Trump goes on TV and is asked about a ... attempted murder of journalists and says well we kill people to that that's going to lead someone like president to ... to think that he can get away with doing the same thing\nThere were lots of instances during the Obama administration where the president's condemned the actions of foreign leaders whether that

lesser violations of prison rules\nAnd chairs investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week today NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's prisons here's this town we associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy steel doors climbing shot [noise]\nThese are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women but once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it there are no more heavy steel doors for the women that's not a summer here\nBecause this prison is new and it's different inside the razor wire this please cooks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by ...\nTheir new just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from Don and helped us depending on what level there and that's the warning showed Tom showing us around and do what we do have in the community of right now are far outside and our yard within ... and I guess it's still a\nPrison the Warren is the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are especially harsh\nBecause across the country women get disappointed that higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules they're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR and middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infractions ... big consequences women get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges\nThat matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today it could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had copies day and I have one\nThe word and show dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison\nIn two thousand sixteen aren't data found women at this prison compared to ... other Iowa prisons were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive now Don ... corrections officers to give out fewer tickets for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just women want to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nDominance putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different past the prison they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent and that women do better when prison is less punitive\nSo Thomas changing the rules especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance last [noise]\nOn the mental health ward Stacey runners in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a slate gray coat wonders an inmate she came to this prison twenty two years ago\nIt was really hard not to get in trouble back then you had to be careful of everything you did it felt like everything was [noise]\nIt's just meant to be punished\nOnce she was sick and statement or sell through breakfast another prisoner brought up and down of from the dining hall and put the fire pillow so I was asleep\nBrought up and down of from the dining hall and put the fire pillow so I was asleep when this crime happened [laughter]\n... got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item [noise] so yeah that was pretty rough\nWouldn't be a violation today but back then wonder says she wants good conduct credits those are days taking off her sentence for good behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary\nWonder is serving time per second degree murder now she says the changing the way women are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nI'm trying to contribute as much as I can see institution so I'm not so much shame [noise]\nYou know and it's helped me with my own my own shame and my own regret\nThe psychiatric unit and the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about the large common room with bell on the therapy animals there are large TV's a carton and lots of natural light\nThere are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now Dr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so they're forced to live here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's presidents several years ago he quit his psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years of my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been changed for months at a time in a basement sold his property or victims of the panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries men in prison\nAnd were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison have long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dumb the warden\nWe always say correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape or fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought forward some concerns and what she said as you know worried and there are some people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there is one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get in Ninety six to not caused problems\nTom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down [noise]\nIt's the one other place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago there are four pods themselves a guard would watch separated from a station above when women with mental illness lived here they would often\nAnd above when women with mental illness quipped here they would often yeah went to the night this is what prison cells to do across the country you we will quite for women or men\nYou dehumanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room that\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nBack back to want to bring up you were disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions often lead the ending up in the cell block like this

including port Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with Mohammad been so long\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and they're\nTwenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both both in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to ah Canada or Mexico first\nA Cushman he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of criminals portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... rolling working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared in America\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared ... is such a genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... about Trump or but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy\nWith questionnaires a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and for secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the crowd press\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion there was one of the White House official who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... ... ... went missing the White House said he and other officials oppressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent\nA but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that cushion or could act as a back channel\nAh to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security chain\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because\nAnd the Saudis and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that's not clear\nAt some of these dealings are are not transparent up but we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he likes the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports\nAre that Kushner a Christian or a backed or associate it a firms
