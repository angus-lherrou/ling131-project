Administration violated their constitutional protections of due process and equal protection the administration has terminated temporary protected status or TPS for immigrants from troubled countries

motivated to end the program by racial bias the Justice Department denies that the administration quote did anything improper unquote immigration hard liners said the injunction is an example of activism by liberal judges\nThis kind of legal decision is exactly what the American people are sick of\nDan Stein is the president of the federation for American immigration reform which wants to

its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have step forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat would Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive that he wants all Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I\nAsked ... to ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone the did than tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending your request for\nA form to fill out and then I filled out the form in fact the former arrived it had been pre filled by the uh presumably the age when I spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the three thousand the characters base was a bill out\nSo you filled out this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent\nUp on it allows so I did not I was never called Bucca we're by my food by my computer ah hoping to get an email\nBack I waited by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think one should live in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or when it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nIs is the basic line was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black and yeah I think Britain me confused that was passing out but the black neon phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to that condition how can one new\nLet me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nI don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about making eighty three eighty four eighty five at college\nBut I Know about like new three maybe four to eighty five at your college and then held that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they're going to very thorough job and that's a nice little\nChat letting ... classmate of Brett

[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created at a healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this ... hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator of dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit to voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job\nEven for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who wants to work will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional in business services that are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that\nThere are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but there are also more workers available to be found\nYeah but they're also more workers available to be found what does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy is more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth that's been kind of sluggish in the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive\nBecause if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set a it makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's Cardiff Garcia co host of our economic podcast the indicator from Planet Money they fought pleasure Ari thanks\n[noise]\nSupport for Planet Money comes from transfer wives a service

Stevens\nIs the thing that the judge and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo Americans so these are not he said she said questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nWell we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who knows\nYears of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who know him\nWell say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week was testifying well\nThat that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him his reputation as family that he would have acted like and what Thomas ... on I had\nBy the way he acted like an atomic time\nI think that response would had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man with expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople wing and then continuing to weigh in on both sides of it is absolutely right [laughter] they let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy that this man will be able\nTo serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice foreign shore I one\nBrett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basing release based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the ... you know became president I don't hear too many people are questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say that the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith\nPolitical hit ... do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question\nThat he found the tactics of some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there are some things they shouldn't have said what things get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the collar but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I I not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer of Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of

September\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent and that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts in trade\nFormer President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration Baker who's senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nIt is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates are said you know look I'm getting to lower gave a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that pace under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people on the fed and many other economists\nWould start to slam on the brakes the unemployment rate got around five percent and they never would have allowed it to get this low\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of

assault in his past\nAnd one year ago today with a New York times broke a bomb\nAnd one year ago today with the New York times broke a bombshell story\nThe times headline on October fifth twenty Seventeen read Harvey Weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades or one of the two reporters who broke that Weinstein story was Jodi Kantor and she joins me now hey there\nHi how are you I'm well thank you I started here you just pointed out today a picture of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the computer in the New York Times' newsroom about to hit soon on the Weinstein story and you write a note of us knew what was going to happen on recent that out into the world\nWe didn't my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because of the times was doing bigger investigations of sexual harassment me knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly we were reporting on Fort factory workers\nBut you never know what's gonna happen to an investigation what it's when it's published and you know one of our editors I'm Matt party\nLike to say as we were working on it and he said hurting aligns dean is not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA andme E. D. D. C. he really was not a household name 'em\nAnd and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which was founded years ago by trying to bark\nTakeoff globally but it just kept going and going\nAnd going there were so many times in the past year when I saw productions that this was going to burn out or you know the women were ... or the news was finally going to stop and it never did and what's happening with judge Kavanaugh I think is representative of that there's a feeling that this reckoning only continues and grows bigger\nAsk you this it if Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote this weekend\nIf Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote this weekend [noise] do you see that as a step back to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which probably have some validity I'll give you the pro and con the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback he was confirmed anyway\nUh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter\nUm women were\n... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of Anita Hill\nThe other argument however is that\nWhat especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country\nShe put high school on the table\nRight she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the presidents and we also saw moments like with um the two protesters and the alligator with Jeff Flake where they were able to literally stop the national conversation for a second and say listen to these stories\nOne footnote to this conversation before I let you go Jody we just heard there from our reporter Shariah hurting awesome but today also marks the order of the Nobel Peace prize prize is often Juno sending a political message\nUm any word went to people working to stop sexual violence as a weapon of war I Wonder if that's one more book and if you work to the vote and global scope of this me to moment that you hoped and motion\nAgo I woke up to the same news
