Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington the attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nI can say with certainty that we will identify interested person or people responsible for these acts\nOK NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts of seems like today it catches up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump\nMay include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned an actor and prominent Trump critic Robert Deniro had received one of the package and ... at an address link to him in New York another common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded a ever had the potential to explode them here hills are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review there\nAre at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI is assistant director William Sweeney says the powder and at least some of these on Globes does not appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives who was reviewed some images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people in intimidate them\nAnd did that was that happening for political or personal reasons all of that is a big focus of this investigation or so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nInvestigators are focusing some resources on New York and some others in Florida\nRemember these packages had to return address in Florida\nSpecifically to the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz shelters not actually linked to these packages she didn't send them but whoever did made her part of the story and there's another reason why authorities are focused on Florida at least some of these homemade pipe bombs may have been mailed from Florida\nBesides the FBI and the ATF postal service investigators

hundred US troops are headed to the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you ... are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that we have created incentives in our immigration system and then she was probably because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four\nCalled caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I I I Know they call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the ... year\nFlood of individuals coming from Central America is on a company children and I was failing units incentivized by laws we passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows him to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction at a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I toured the northern ... countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when we say that we're that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nAnd I've never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican other than\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truthfully it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds is opposed we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nWould not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I've had that I I Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with the new President Trump has suggested that damage\nI have a second claim with you as President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats [noise] want caravans they liked the care of and it's a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can end these incentives I mean let's face it some of them there's Lucian is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from this ask you the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this occurred in Honduras or people opposed to a prison Hernandez down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my promised treatment homeland security most of these\nLaws aren't under my means jurisdiction we've gotta do to my company's ... diction because since this year I was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I can start handling this so I'm trying to go through this\nAs a business person would a problem solver gather the information find the ... in our community we you know we all agree what to secure the border that we have to have\nReasonable asylum standards that are maintained that we want to\nIn our community we yeah we all agree once you're the or reasonable silence standards that are maintained that we want enforce

during the quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports there were signs of potential trouble including ... business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers that's historic an unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economists expected and it was a drop from the foreign point two percent growth rate in the second quarter still the numbers were impressive former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks are growing as fast as my life that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent it and especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips in eight out and restaurants more only Maloof is

look outside of the consumer real you're starting to see some headwinds of caring for the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that has steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen spending by people in businesses over time and they're already signs of weakness in the housing in car markets\nDeco also site say gradual slowing in the global economy in Europe and Asia meanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wane by next year ... says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see so much slower momentum but overall the economy is still doing quite well\nAnother question mark hanging over the economy is trade there is what ... calls they growing spirit of protectionism right now\nThe U.S has already imposed tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports and China has retaliated there's no telling what impact it will have
