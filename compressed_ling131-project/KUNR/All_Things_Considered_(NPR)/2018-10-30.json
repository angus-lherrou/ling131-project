President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred must stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nThink the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the meeting\nCondemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president and she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative\nOr even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country and she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the solar in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is or when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nFirst job I can she doesn't have any of this was I Am\nShe doesn't have any Indian but I have more than she does and I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people\nAnd calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence in many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences be in the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm ... supporters of Trump could

living in motels according to the Reno alliance for the homeless Nico Colombian is the lead organizer of our town Reno he says the exact number of homeless people in our area is difficult to pin down\nWell it's always hard to get different numbers but there are some recent numbers for example let's say that four thousand\nPeople are living in motels currently in Reno or the homeless numbers are always hard to to figure out there's data from a washer county school system about how many of their students are not how to properly and their numbers are usually in the three thousand range\nColombian with our town Reno is a street reporting organization which focuses on exposing the resolving issues around homelessness we have that conversation coming up at four forty four catered

their loved ones to rest today the funeral services as of Dr Jerry Rabinowitz Daniel Stein and the brothers sea salt and David Rosenthal began a formal period of mourning for the city's Jewish community\nMeanwhile President Trump also visited Pittsburgh despite objections from the city's mayor and some Jewish leaders NPR's Brian Mann is outside the tree of life synagogue where the killings took place on Saturday Hi Brian Hi Ari it tell us about what the president did during the visit\nOther presidents to end the first lady and also Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump or right here at the synagogue gets quiet now are just people are paying respects their candles led by uh the memorial here a while the president and first lady were here they are placed white flowers and stones\nOn each of the memorials for the eleven people who died they also a lit candles inside um during their visit\nAfter visiting the synagogue the president's motorcade went to the hospital the treated survivors of the attack and I understand to the police officers injured in that attack are still being treated there tell us about what happened to the hospital\nThe president met with all of the six officers wounded while responding to this attack Daniel need was shot in the hand Timothy maps and suffered multiple gunshot wounds they're still being cared for their um he met the president met with that and also the doctors and nurses who who healthcare for the victims are and and members of their families and or I should say\nDems are and and members of their families and or I should say that he also a signed baseballs and and just kind of chatted with uh some of the officers were there and during the visit he was accompanied by Israel's ambassador to the U.S Ron drummer\nThis visit has been controversial uh Pittsburgh's mayor was invited to meet with the president and declined one of the people there told you\nYou know this is a a really complicated time for people in the city um there has been a real debate here about whether the president is the right figure to be involved in this period of mourning\nI spoke earlier today with Angela feral who attended one of the funerals in the squirrels hill neighborhood uh and she said she thinks a male mayor ... should have met with the president\nI don't think it's a good thing that the marathon here supporting the president I think that the national they shake\nAnd I should say that after the president departed I went to one of the protests here uh and spoke with Nathan Siegel he was marching ah and and he says he grew up in the squirrel hill neighborhood attending the tree of life synagogue\nIt's my home and it's really terrifying and I'm beginning to attract what have the audacity to a year here when he has a naval styling constantly fanning the flames of hate he does not speak for me and I don't want him in my community\nSo you can hear Ari emotions are are really high I I Do want to say the protesters really made a show a thanking police and other first responders who helped after this attack so even as they were criticizing the president a lot of people here were calling for unity and healing\nAnd just briefly there were four funerals today seven more to come in the days ahead I Know you talk with some people attending those\nThis is Kay you win our [noise]\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and

between President Trump's associates and Russia\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate and a legit scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either our first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week and it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's offices you know it's usually very tight lipped about an ... decided to speak\nUh the specials ... special counsel's offices you know it's usually very tight lipped about I did decide to speak about this uh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of a earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against smaller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller or at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual\nWorking from the okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting raining here\nThe timing is indeed curious yes ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist your the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV ah which is owned by Trump confidence\nThe U.S to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV\nUh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty Seventeen or a theory that has since been debunk some of the news organizations that covered it have actually retracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Miller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you thank you\nEbola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months more than two hundred and forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend more than thirty per week NPR's ... eyes and men explains why this outbreak has proven difficult to end\nLast month she ... found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd yeah ... could be a young rocks or some had empty bottles idea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator of these safe burial teams they sent into the community\nWhen someone has died of Ebola at home\nOn this date the team in come to pick up the body of a child enough on decided on a boy is seven\nI guess as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the ...\nThere's a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the team arrived at first people were just watching as the team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as the team was about to put the boy into a body bag\nThe book other long before the boy's father's rushed in and said you changed his mind he didn't want his son take him to ...\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nOn ... on credit to some Vermont to be you know you're going to be now you're just fear the worst because you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showing here will provoke ground ... are also trying to get out before someone throws the first wrong because you know once that happens everyone will start throwing\nIdea and his team did manage to drive off and time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week [noise] partly it's because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it\nThey're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people in scary plastic suits\nBut there's another issue she's put on is a senior analyst with international crisis group local population is very distrustful of government even though this part of the D. R. C. has a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor\nMany believe the ruling authorities only care about exploring the wealth for themselves we haven't seen anything from this government perhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area\nAnd not of the central government nor the United nations' peacekeeping force that is thousands strong has offered to much protection just ten days ago when\nStrong has offered much protection just ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children and so says put on when an authority figure be from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak is even ... you know whether they're true motives the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group\nPeople in the affected town or city had been staging street protests during which he bought the responders are forced to hunker down that includes health workers who would normally be tracing anyone who has had contact with an infected person so the contact can be vaccinated and monitored\nArthur is one of the officials tracking people epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nSo every time this happens you're teams don't go out they don't see the contacts\nAnd the disease spreads the world Health Organization has called for more security in the outbreak zone but production of international crisis group says the un is trying to wind down its presence in the D. R. C. so it's very unlikely that peacekeepers in the outbreak zone\nRight now the UN's main focus on the ... elections that are set for December making sure the government actually holds them and doesn't crack down on opposition groups\nIn fear of the un has to shift its pieces on the trust poured\nAway from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country [noise] health workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling\nThe longer this goes on we may go to a point where the dampening effect we hope using the vaccine is no longer\nFact that we have using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission down\nAnd then Arthur says we could move into a more explosive outbreak ...

eleven murders\nWB or a special correspondent David do area is covered Bolger for decades and joins us now by David Hi Ari the FBI and us attorney's office in West Virginia said they're going to investigate Bulger's death what can you tell us about what happened to him\nWhat we what we know are is that he was transferred to the hazel in federal prison in West Virginia last night he was placed in the general population but he didn't make it to roll call this morning and when authorities investigated they found\nBolger bent over or having been killed he suffered by the way nine heart attacks while in federal prison in Florida just before coming up here he was in a wheelchair and he had a bottle of emergency heart attack medicine around his neck but he was killed\nHe has been a character in the public eye for decades remind people of his back story while\nWe you know you have to think of him is at the beginning in the middle in the end of six decades of awe inspiring evil and violence and corruption during what was called by the war on organized crime and he served\nAs a top secret FBI informant which meant that by helping put his rivals behind bars\nBunker became the most feared mobster in New England\nAnd he did something else he corrupted the agents and cops so that he turned the Federal Bureau of investigation into would've sexually was the Bolger bureau of investigation and they tipped him off to would be informants\nSo that he couldn't turn kill them as lieutenant Kevin ... once told me don't you could look out the window from the south Boston home point to the city

damn\nAs they should have been a beholder the FBI they enabled empowered in Boulder and him even giving them the names of these would be witness\nAnd the Justice Department he claimed to deal with them but but they certainly were protecting him ... to the fact that when he won on the lam in in California was out there for sixteen years people refuse to believe that the FBI was really looking for his FBI handler John Connelly\nAh who became celebrated as the prince of the city the principal law enforcement for bringing down the mafia New England even typical dropped with coming indictment and so that set them off for sixteen years leaving the wreckage field behind him\nAnd just in our last thirty seconds tell us about the final chapter of his life behind bars he was convicted in two thousand Thirteen what's happened since then\nHe's been targeted before buddy inmates for bragging rights that they beat up or even killed\nThe mob boss but he was a self styled tough guy and he claimed he had to deal with the Justice Department\nAnd he didn't come clean about treatment he prided himself on having attended in graduated from the notorious Alcatraz prison and he wants the epitaph his epitaph to be I'd rather be an Alcatraz\nW. B. or a special correspondent David ... thanks so much You're welcome you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nGood afternoon it's for forty four and fifty five degrees in Reno fifty five from Fallon and fifty in El loco\nUp next from our news team with four thousand people in Reno now living in motels according to the Reno alliance for the homeless\nTo talk about what homelessness looks like in this community hey when our Stephanie serrano sat down with Nico Colombian and instructor at the rental school of journalism and the lead organizer of our town Reno and street reporting organization focused on exposing the results\nA street reporting organization focused on exposing the revolving issues of homelessness in Reno\nSo part of what our town of Reno guys as document homeless stories why is this important to do so\nThat our town Reno we believe every story is valuable every single voice uh deserves to be heard\nTo look at different populations that don't necessarily get their voices are stories out there in the mainstream media and it's really a focus on giving their perspective as Reno is changing as Reno's rebranding that it's important also give the voice of the people that are being the most impacted\nAnd within the last couple of years I have seen the numbers increase in Reno\nWell it's always hard to get different numbers but there are some recent numbers for example let's say that four thousand\nPeople are living in motels currently in Reno uh the homeless numbers are always hard to to figure out there's data from Washington County school system about how many of their students are not housed properly\nAnd their numbers are usually in the three thousand range these are are the students themselves another interesting stat or that has come up recently is that Nevada ranks last\nIn or access to affordable housing for the poorest segment of society so we have very alarming numbers here in Reno in Nevada\nWent that far double housing prices can identify the impacts on homelessness and the city has a whole\nAll linked together so are there is a fight on blight and there are demolishing a lot of motels and motels have often become a a last resort housing for people who can't afford a the cheaper apartments\nPeople who can't afford a the cheaper apartments uh you know they have bad credit or you know they can't afford first month last month deposits\nOr they have a pet they want to live with you know different scenarios but so some people live in motels which are being torn down and sometimes they have no solution other then becoming homeless affordable housing you know some people\nAre are living in an apartment and then they remodeled the apartment or the prices go up and they're on fixed income we have a lot of senior citizens\nWho are on fixed income from the government we have a lot of a disabled neighbors who are on six disability income and once uh they can't afford any more sometimes they'll live with roommates or sometimes they they're lucky enough to find some the section eight housing\nBut sometimes these dominoes start falling uh the prices rise and they can't afford anything anymore\nWhat are some of the next conceptions revolving around homelessness\nWell a lot of people think about the homeless problem that it's their problem that it's the city's problem but fundamentally the problem of the person who is not well house also ah it can happen to everyone and a lot of the people we interview it's often\nA you know a health situation which goes wrong they can't pay the bills anymore and they fall into homelessness or a lot of the homeless\nAre victims of severe trauma in their life uh there's a lot of women who escape a very abusive relationships and who end up on the streets\nAnd then it's very difficult once you are on the streets and once you start losing your ID your papers uh once you don't have any possessions really anymore to really dig yourself out of that hole and some of the other misconceptions for example is you know\nOut of that hole and some of the other misconceptions for example is you know uh the the the use of shelters and some people just don't do well in the shelter environment but there are just some people\nWho are just don't coped very well when they're surrounded by so many people in a very structured environment so there are some people who who prefer to to live along the river\nWhat are the dangers that surrounds house less or homeless people in Reno\nBasically when you lack proper housing you're in just a much more a precarious state we're approaching winter\nUh you know your your body is much more frail when you're out in the elements all the time you have no privacy uh you're also much more prone to attacks from others who abused from others are so it's just\nEverything is just more difficult when you don't have housing our whole society has built on this this concept of you know being house so you you're different than other people so it becomes very difficult don't\nBe afraid when you see a homeless person to talk to them for a few minutes to give them a smile to give them a hug don't be afraid\nOf when you walk by the motel to rather walk on the other side of the sidewalk go into the motel for a second and say hello to one of your neighbors you know these are part the people who live in motels of the people who are homeless are part of our community they are not a different community\nThank you so much income thank you\nThat's Nico Colombian with our town Reno speaking with Caitlin I Stephanie serrano our town Reno would present a lot of discussion on resident motel live this Thursday November first at five PM at the desert rose in its for forty nine good afternoon\nTo
