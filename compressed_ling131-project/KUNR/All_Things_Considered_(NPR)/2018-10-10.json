talk about ... what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John Hi also so what made the market plummeted\nEh yeah I was a tough day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous and in fact this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred a rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern\nA rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go\nThe Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it will stop raising benchmark rage between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there so\nThe way I understand the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right are there fewer than inflation right now\nWell Federal Reserve chair a drone Paul has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at fifty year low so there's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation\nPressures so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market\nEconomy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today's sell off is not the end of the bull market in stocks here but while the U.S economy remains strong Europe has cooled a bit as have emerging markets and the IMF\nGave a less than glowing assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the

gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and it's been one of the foundations of this ball market in fact uh the tech heavy\nInto this bull market in fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value today and that's and the five hundred which also has a lot of tech lost three and a ... percent so it's been a very\nTough day for tech and very tough day but it is just the beginning of along down there trying for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that called for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down\nBut we are at a point where investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession we're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough\nThat the interest rates they're paying is starting to compete with stocks\nWill see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow and then the U.S market will have another\nCrack at

S. government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person is a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis ineffective we said we know what you're up to\nBack off ...\nWhy do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I\nThink there's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm has come to him and there is a real concerned about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that they administer ration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saturday\nBecome very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a hoot to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership in Saudi Arabia when\nYou talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely jerk ...
