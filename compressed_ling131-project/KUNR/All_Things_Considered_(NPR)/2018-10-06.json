things considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly and judge Brett Kavanaugh it\nIt'd be in our lives for decades he will change the balance of the Supreme Court replacing the courts swing vote Anthony Kennedy and he may have an impact on control of Congress and how much President Trump is able to accomplish for the remainder of his presidency\nThis hour how did we get here what does Kavanaugh's confirmation mean for the Supreme Court and what are the ramifications for the country a country that is in the midst of the me too movement and a month away from the mid term elections\nLet's start with the defining moment on the Senate floor when America found out that Brett Kavanaugh was all but guaranteed to sit on the court\nMr President I Will follow chicken for judge Kaplan\nMaine Republican Senator Susan Collins with her closing argument in support of Kavanaugh that came after a contentious three months that began on July night\nHe's a brilliant jurist with a clear ineffective writing style universally regarded as one of the finest and sharpest legal minds of our time\nPresident Trump had promised to nominate judges who oppose abortion rights Kavanaugh's name came from a list given to the president by the federalist society an advocacy group with the conservative agenda the cabinet told senators that he viewed the landmark roe versus Wade decision settled law\nAs a judge it is an important precedent of the Supreme Court by it I mean roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey been reaffirmed many times Casey is precedent on precedent which itself is enforced\nPresident on precedent which itself is very important factor to remember\nAnd I understand the significance of the issue the jurors credential issue and I understand the significance as best I can I always try you know I Do hear of the real world\nEffects of that decision as I tried to do of all the decisions of my court and all of the Supreme Court\nHe also promised to be a fair and impartial judge\nBeing a good judge means paying attention to the words that are written the words of the constitution the words of the statutes that are passed by Congress not doing what I Want to do\nIn early September Democrats used there two days of questioning Kevin a to point out that they weren't given enough information about his record but after the first round of hearings Kavanaugh's confirmation looked like a sure thing\nUntil a week later when the Washington Post published a story about allegations from Christine Blasey Ford who claimed Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when both were in high school\nShe agreed to testify about it before the Senate Judiciary committee in one of the most watched congressional hearings in decades\nMain motivation and cutting for waiting to be helpful and fight facts about how Mr cabinet access had damaged my life so that you could take into a serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed\nIt is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr Kavanaugh deserve to sit on the Supreme Court my responsibility is to tell you the truth\nWith the nation's attention on Washington cabinet offered a fiery response to the accusation\nSeven and special coverage from NPR on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination to the Supreme Court coming up at six we have marketplace followed by the daily you're on K U when are\nWe are back now with a special report from NPR News the Brett Kavanaugh vote I'm Jeremy ... in Washington so what does the nomination and confirmation process we've witnessed over the past three months I mean for the Supreme Court the conservative Kavanaugh will replace Justice Anthony Kennedy who was for three decades the swing vote on the court\nWe heard from retired Justice John Paul Stevens this week is Ninety eight was appointed by Gerald Ford and said Kana should not be on the court\nIs the thing that the rules and he should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think one of his performance during the hearings cause me to change but I Would\n... an extraordinary moment of former justice saying that about a nominee\nWell what he said was that because Kavanaugh had framed his entire critique at his the second round of hearings as a partisan attack not just on Democrats but I'm liberal groups and I'm like liberal activists\nThat all those people when they come to the Supreme Court\nCould rightly maintained that they won't get a fair and unbiased hearing from him and you saw Brett Kavanaugh today the wall Street Journal tried to walk back is what he said called his emotional comments but he didn't say specifically which ones in any event Steven's point was that uh\nThat he might have to recuse himself now I think that's a very highly unlikely possibility given\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was probably try and find some opportunities ah like he has recently with the editorial that he wrote to try and asked for some sympathy from the public and understanding exactly the kinds of pressure that he was under and what he was feeling in terms of how his family was\nUnder the spotlight with these attacks and try and kind of walk back the sense that he has some active partisan and get back into the mode where in his original testimony when he first came before the the committee and really gave us this air of being a truly neutral arbiter of questions that come in front of him\nI Want to go through some key issues here that people are thinking about as they contemplate what Kevin I Will mean for the Supreme Court abortion first of all you know what do you think this is going to mean for the issue of abortion\nWell I think it's pretty clear that at least\nThere are five justices on the court who now will begin to whittle away at abortion rights they may not overtly reverse roe versus Wade but we could end up in this situation in which in those states where abortion is ... that that abortion rights are\nAre popular they remain and in those states where they are highly unpopular they know there is no longer a clinic there because they can't function under the rules that are laid down by the state law\nWhat about same sex marriage a Justice Anthony Kennedy a who is retiring who did retire or authored that decision Tom Goldstein about same sex marriages that issue going to come up against well I don't\nThink in terms of whether there is a right to same sex marriages would be very surprising to see the court kind of do a one eighty on that there are areas of the law where there's just playing the joints where you don't have to overrule something so to take abortion the standard is whether it's an undue burden on the woman\nAnd have to overrule something so to take abortion the standard is whether it's an undue burden on the woman's ... exercise at the right or who knows what that means you can feel into that whatever it is you want almost and that's why I'm more conservative court can allow more state regulation but there is a right to same sex marriage is a binary light switch on light switch off thing I can see them doing it\nWhere there isn't necessarily a right to is\nAll kinds of things that go with it like a king you require the florists too is against same sex marriage to design\nA floral arrangements for your wedding or as we saw a ... a cake wedding cake or a photographer to take photographs or go to the photography studio and have them develop photographs of your same sex wedding\nI mean ... most states have laws that require\nEqual treatment of everybody you can't just pick and choose who your customers are as long as they behave themselves\nBut their ... you know so far that remains the law of the land as it is but unless Congress were to pass\nA federal statute requiring equal treatment of um same sex couples for example it's not necessarily true that that would ... that would be true everywhere\nOne thing where you are likely to see is a Supreme Court that's more sympathetic to religious objections to doing things for example involving abortion or same sex marriage in light the county clerk who doesn't want to provide a marriage certificate that sort of thing the core right maybe there but the things that actually also help same sex couples really feel like they're equal\nMaybe more in the question what about the issue of presidential\nMaybe more in question what about the issue of presidential power President Trump is currently under investigation the Robert Mueller investigation is going on ... will will cabinet being on the court make any difference there\nWell we we know that he has said things that are at least ... the police questioned the correctness of then famous Nixon tapes decision which would which required the ... President Nixon to turn over tape recordings that incriminate him in the end that we're putting into an ongoing criminal investigation\nUh it is true he's also said that it's one of if he cited it in a list of one of the great cases showing the independence of the judiciary but he also said things that may be set has said maybe it was wrongly decided\nThat we really don't know where he is on that what we do know is that he's a very very strong advocate of executive power in a wide array of areas\nAnd even proposed at one point that Congress should pass a law that would exempt that President from criminal investigation or civil suits while he's president\nNo on this question he only has one vote obviously but I Do think you'll probably get a lot of respect for this he spent a lot of time and the executive branch you spend it in the White House and it was part of the Ken Starr investigation and so his view of how disruptive this can be to the presidency to have you know criminal proceedings in Grand juries unlike me get a lot of attention from the other justices\nWhere is Kevin are going to fit a on the court in terms of the other conservatives you already have Justice Alito Justice Thomas now justice Gorsuch pretty reliable conservatives and Justice Roberts as he become the\nLiable conservatives and Justice Roberts as he become the swing vote on the corner Robert in it in a technical sense there probably are some cases like the case involving Obamacare and we she cast the deciding vote but mostly\nObama and the other conservatives and in the court or at least pretty much in lock step on the outcome I mean he dissented in gay marriage he dissented and gerrymandering he descended in a whole bunch of other you know in a whole bunch of other cases as long as Anthony Kennedy was on the court\nHe could move the balance board a little bit when he decided that this was a subject I'm which he agreed with the liberals to some extent or another there's nobody like that in the center of the court and have there are four\nPretty liberal justices I Would call them to most liberals they would seem to be moderate liberals but they are on the liberal side and then five quite hard core\nConservative with chief justice Roberts I think really worried about the court institutionally not going too far too fast but\nUh that's probably what's holding him back I think\nYeah and I think the that ... that phrase too fast is probably where it's going to be you're going to see the chiefs influenced the most not that he's going to switch sides but he's going to turn into a liberal all of a sudden\nBut rather that he is going to want to keep the pay slow so that the court isn't being seen as extremely aggressive and partisan particularly over the course of the next say twelve months or so or he may not want to see cases overturned rat quite rapidly but he wouldn't mind seeing the law of all in a conservative\nThere are three cases in front of the court right now asking the court to her\nThree cases in front of the court right now asking the court to reverse very long standing precedence and there's a whole sort of a architecture of conservative legal thought that wants to the court to do that with in a whole wide array of areas\nSpecial coverage from NPR continues until six o'clock and then we bring you marketplace followed by the daily on K U when our\n[noise]\nThis is a special report from NPR News the Brett Kavanaugh vote I'm Jeremy ... and the vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court comes on the year anniversary of the me too movement it also comes a month before the midterm elections which will determine whether Democrats or Republicans control the house and the Senate\nAnd how much President Trump will be able to get done for the remainder of his presidency\nNPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell start with you what does this mean for the key races coming up\nWell the one thing that we are going to be watching very closely as what it means for Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat from North Dakota who voted no\nUh she was under a lot of pressure to support Kavanaugh because she is running for reelection in a state that President Trump won with a very significant margin in twenty sixteen\nPolls have shown her slipping recently but she put out a statement saying that she was making her decision based both on the fact that she thought that his performance at that Thursday hearing was partisan\nAnd because she worried about the message that would send to women and young girls about the treatment of the way that we're in an America treat the accusations of sexual assault\nShe is in a precarious situation here running against a very conservative House Republican who has strong name id in that state\nAnd she as far as I can understand it from talking to people that know her well made that decision here but that got decision may be a really big and you know may take a hit for her in the polls other person I'm watching as Joe mansion in West Virginia who is the only Democrat who\nAnd I'm watching as Joe mansion in West Virginia who is the only Democrat who voted yes and he said that he had is looking out for what's right for West Virginia again a state that President Trump won fairly significantly and twenty sixteen\nDominican much in our NPR's lead politics editor ... is this going to impact the races of people who don't have to vote on this I'm thinking of people like ... or who's running in Texas against Ted Cruz\nHe's got his own uh uphill battle and uh that's the fact that a Texas is Texas [laughter] that's a different situation but I think he's right the zero in on some of these red state Republican a red state Democrats who are running in places\nThat President Trump won you know Texas is among those kinds of places but first and foremost you gotta look\nA like a tells you mentioned that Heidi Heitkamp you know someone like John ... says he's no he said in Montana or in Montana seems fine in his race but Joe Donnelly who I really wonder if he would have rather\nKind of said nothing uh before saying no immediately after uh that Thursday hearing uh I don't think Democrats quite realized how this was going to fire up Republican\nWhite men in particular this\nUh you know our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll really showed a big shift among Republicans and it was driven by by men within the Republican Party\nA who shifted very quickly and you know you have something like eighty percent of the Republican Party right now saying that the elections are a very important and that significant because that's basically a tie statistical tie with Democrats\nBecause that's basically a tie statistical tie with Democrats\nAnd Democrats had a ... point advantage on that over the summer now does that remained this high or does that recede given the fact that cabinet looks like he will be confirmed and the fact is\nDemocrats democratic women democratic men they have been fired up this entire time and are expected to stay at that level\nOkay well let's listen we've been talking to a a couple of strategies on each side here this is John ... Republican strategist and here's what he thinks that this means\nWhat we found at least in the last week is there certainly seems to be some Republicans come home um the problem we had is that particularly moderate Republicans are not huge fans of this president he makes up for that oftentimes by getting conservative Democrats\nBut at least in one of the surveys I've seen in the last week\nA lot of them felt number one that the Democrats overplay their hand that it wasn't even that they didn't believe professor Ford they just were unhappy with one of the tactics that they saw the Democrats seeking and felt that uh they were they were just merely playing politics\nAnd I'm so it was interesting too it's so it's going to find the the Republican Party a bit and um I I I think the question now is can they keep that sort of small momentum going all the way until election day\nOkay so that's a Republican strategist this is democratic strategist Anna Greenberg\nI think it's very helpful for Democrats I think it's I'm going to galvanize women who are already feeling aggrieved\nBut I also think that the way from an example down and attacked Dr Ford and his rallies and I think here of cabinet eyes testimony I just think all of it with hands are fairly easily been confirmed in the end um well this galvanize that are packed even more\nTells me I was down on Capitol Hill earlier today I'm Talking with protesters outside this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo what they do they're both looking at how this plays with their bases and like I was saying both bases are fired up over this right\nThe real issue I think for what's going to determine this election\nIs how those swing voters those middle of the road suburban women\nOr do you know go out and vote in this election do they go out and vote in some of these kind of moderate to right leaning districts in these house districts now look remember Democrats need twenty three seats Internet twenty three seats to take back the house I think that what we've seen over the past\nWeek or two with how the Senate numbers have moved there is a very real possibility\nThat Democrats wind up losing out in the Senate where they lose a couple of seats and wind up taking back the house that's a very real possibility has been a real possibility from the beginning and it's starting to look more like the most likely scenario\nBecause the ... the Republican leaning a suburban women have really moved very sharply and been sharply opposed to President Trump\nOr all along and there was a huge list of a potential targets in those are in the ... suburban district\nThe numbers in the Senate let's read reprise those are repressed those um there are\nA twenty six to ... twenty six Democrats up for democratic Democrat and only nine and then only nine Republican seats and and and that ten of those are in overwhelmingly resonates so out of the Democratic seats the of the seats the Democrats\nOf the Democratic seats the of the seats the Democrats have to hold onto our and overwhelmingly red states\nIt's a it's it doesn't require huge uphill climb well it's worse than that it's actually the worst landscape ever for a Senate map that any party has ever faced since the direct election of senators guest\nLindsey Graham would say it's it's hell and beyond health [laughter]\nSo so ... for Democrats um we're in the midst of course of the me too movement and even during this entire nomination process for Brett Kavanaugh\nTo executives at CBS News became the latest men to be ousted or because of allegations of of a sexual misconduct let's say\nPresident Trump has been accused himself Brett Kavanaugh as we know has been accused they it it appears both have ... so far survived those allegations while so many other uh\nHave fallen Kelsey a one in three women have been victims themselves of sexual assault one in six men I think as they watched everything that went on\nHow does that play I mean they they have personal experience with the kinds of things that Christine Blasey Ford ... was talking about\nAnd I think that one of the things that we're seeing is that there and women are finding more space to have this conversation and it's important to remember that the conversation about Ford and cabinet is one element of a much much broader ... like a much broader debate in this country about who do you believe", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Reno", "day": "06"}
