that were addressed a democratic political figures this week authorities say five devices were sinking identical bubble line manila envelopes each of them with the return address a former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nBut those envelopes weren't all of this suspicious packages reported today for more on this we're joined by NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas Hey Ryan either\nOkay so take me through this the FBI says there were five potential explosive devices but they're also report more\nThat's right so the FBI so that these envelopes were address to George Soros he's a billionaire a big contributor to democratic causes a Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan\nOf the package that was intended for Britain was sent to CNN's New York office right or not clear why that was but\nYes there were other people who said they received ... suspicious packages today one of them was in New York governor Andrew Cuomo who is a Democrat his office later said however\nUh that the package didn't contain any sort of suspicious explosives another was California congresswoman Maxine Waters US Capitol police say that they intercepted a suspicious package that was addressed to her\nThey say it was removed and is being investigated by the FBI\nRight now we don't know where the the FBI didn't mention her because her package a doesn't belong with the others or perhaps it would just was received too late in the clear at this point but the FBI did say in a statement on Wednesday that ah it's possible that there are more suspicious packages out there or that it doesn't know about at this point\nSo what do we know about the five packages that the FBI discussed in its announcement earlier well a law enforcement\nThe ... in ... earlier\nWell law enforcement official described him as pipe bombs earlier today in the case of the ones that the CNN or the package also is said to have contained to white powder\nNow the FBI itself says that all of the explosive devices were mailed in these identical bubble wrap envelopes the address is on the packages were computer printed the return address on all of them was as you mentioned for Wasserman Schultz although her last name was ... was misspelled\nEach package had six U.S Postal service stamps although in the one photo of a package that was provided by the FBI doesn't appear as though they were post marked which could mean that in that case or the individual or individuals ah put stance on it but didn't actually mail it now\nThe package addressed a former attorney general Eric Holder didn't make it to his office it was re routed the FBI says to the return a address which of course is Wasserman Schultz now she says today that she didn't send these uh she says she's deeply disturbed by these packages are disturbed that it showed up in that her name has been used and and all this\nAnd they

to a region of the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight world mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of a valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding now and I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together at another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd honestly\nAt another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboys stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick up by your bootstraps mentality and\nKathy evil who's worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act the old way wasn't working\nVictoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of peer mentor\nMendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts news sources of strength suicide prevention program and she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble\nOr these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first\nAnd also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in\nClassrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nAt orchard Mason middle school\nEighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping note cards to ...\nI don't think all the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friend [noise]\nHow a friend is help them through tough times lily points up to her son the crowded wall\nDeporting keeping them positive\nBecause I feel like even if they're down you can like help them be positive and just stuff like that and see what they're going through so they don't feel like getting I literally has brown hair and a poem\nLike literally has brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing blue sources of strength ... with the words hope help strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others\nShe says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad's suicide\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's cost to share but like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people cope I don't mind sharing it what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking and the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people on the front lines sound confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband to suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here he was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War leader he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seen as a pillar\nHas no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful place\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's\nDeath oh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that there are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes tools husband or lily leaves data and uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nAre really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morris says the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well\nYou have a super powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movement and changing social norms and changing the things that need to change\nKids

D. also the secret service and as you mentioned there are ten packages\nAre found in New York Florida Delaware California, Maryland this is really sprawling and law enforcement of trying to put together all these different pieces that they've collected from these packages there either all center on their way to FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the ...\nThe details here and trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in a package that was sent to CNN the New York all of his uh uh the eyes Williams Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular ... did not present a biological for other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices or else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these\nYou know explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intense they're they're focusing in the investigation or asking for tips from the public\nAre there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now well\nOne big question is where these packages sent through the postal system or some of them could they have been delivered by carrier and also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I\nSpoke with a former ATF agents and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that may be able to identify who who is the individual or individuals' behind this\nAnd also they're looking at a closed circuit TV footage to see if they have any indication of who may be involved and you really can't rule out that there may be more packages out there and so that's something that a postal workers and law enforcement on the lookout for\nIn the meantime what more is known about the packages that were found today in Delaware and New York or\nThe packages in New York as we mentioned earlier was were sent to vice president former vice president Joe Biden\nAnd early ... were sent to vice president former vice president Joe Biden Newcastle county Delaware and there was one baggage that was sent to the business office of Robert De Niro here in Manhattan and what's really interesting is actually found by retired cop\nWas working for um the Sunni rose production company and he spotted after noticing very similar resemblance to photos of packages found earlier this week

Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nShow I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment\nBy NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David chaotic so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy well Kelly a obviously a host of the nine am an hour\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our stage show she's had was having a chat a couple of days ago with several panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\nYou get in trouble if you are a white person who went on for a black person and puts out a white Halloween like that was okay as long as you address character\nAnd then of course that tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by whites\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply or is it notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story a both by a on the NBC nightly news uh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks\nI and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a two for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from El ... uh he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShe does a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin uh perhaps the newest co hosted today show he weighed in as well\nWas some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run among um that's silly and it's nice and juniors and it's it's it's just as ignorant and racist as a statement itself or NBC News\nIgnorant and racist as a statement itself or NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well\nThis isn't the first time making Kelly as his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to her own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host much sharper edge parks and he's hosted she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ were white\n... back in a twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show has been ailing a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings are and she had a relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who retains his ties to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular figures in a town hall and\nI ... at that nine AM our end her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in a dish and she was paid an extraordinary amount of money or for a uh for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideas\nThing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office that's\nNPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you ...\nBack in Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear round eroded um we do every year in ... which in fact we joke\nThat October is black ... I've been an advocate Halloween is likely to Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as\nWell walk us through some of the history of this when did we first started seeing black face in America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds or may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like black people I talked to in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course he's missile shows depicted black people with lazy as animal is to play caricatures the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad humidity shouldn't allow slavery to happen at the time and so these caricatures linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ...\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and Blackfish [noise]\n\n[noise] my\n[noise]\nSo there's a whole history of you know read these portrayals of Native Americans and yellow face portrayals of Asian American pie and think of Mickey Rooney is character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy set against that and\nTo be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nOne of the people who are caffeine caricatured often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people with mental shows who are not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... to track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history ... what do you make of that\nI mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel this all wiping out to the port and\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time of these conversations about race in history in power they always become conversations about intent and not about sort of the broader context we always start in a historical vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just agree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up and we are because they were a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when these controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party dressed in blackface usually there is not a black person in the ...\nParty dressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party me bad an eyelash but then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and then that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery and so maybe these annual conversations\nWill be better served if we spent less time parsing out what's going on A People's souls and whether they're good people are not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently\nProminent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences NPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team ... thank you so much Mary Louise the next like silver [laughter] I felt a lot [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nThere is an oil boom in ... Texas it's one of the most competitive congressional districts in the country how politics are playing in the oil field\nThat feel like it's going to dry up and you\nAnd drop dry plus the latest on suspicious package threats that's tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\nJoined the center for MORNING EDITION tomorrow from four to nine right here on KU when our [noise]\nIt's four thirty good afternoon we get support from envy energy providing clean renewable energy\nFrom envy energy providing clean renewable energy to Nevada and and now offering equal pay to commercial customers a plan for equal payments every month for twelve month information that envy energy dot com [noise]\nStop why what what's your argument\nSo actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations this goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs\nHelping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSo if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave\nYes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs and Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nKnow each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day than we need to be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere\nTo be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places\nTo make them safer and so we should be looking here near to a home for places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nTo Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now trans national in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here\nIn our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them to do\nNow I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest\nThose governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American governments to protect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations thanks so much\nListening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe cerebellum is a part of the brand that his best known for helping us keep our balance turns out this ancient part of the brain may have been under estimate it a new study suggests it also helps us manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planning NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nCerebellum doesn't get much respect scientists often dismiss it as that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico do some boxes they found some surprising connections\nAnd Dr Nico dozen boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent is dedicated to higher order cognitive functions\nWhat kind of cognitive functions Scott America post doc and doesn't box lab offers some examples\nAbstract thinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of his day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effortless\nAmerica Says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but does in boxes the finding published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum is cruel than most people thought but these results for re more exciting and clear then I could have ever dreamt\nDon't send Bock says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's the way scientists the neurologist had been missing in front of the time\nAnd those are not says the new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when it impairs the cerebellum\nYou have an explanation for all the bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking ... editing of your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results is Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum is changed\nOrders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum is changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of Syria but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs that are involved in cognition means at cerebellum is involved in those process to use as well\n... says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it's smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhat we now understand is that what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nMom and says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but when it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is increasing\nEvidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder all have a link to cerebellum\nAnd mom and says he and other researchers are already trying to fix some of these problems using treatments that make the cerebellum itself work better Jon Hamilton NPR News [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nGood afternoon it for forty eight this is Katie Wendt are coming up
