can you start by describing the scene in the oval office this afternoon\nIt so you had President Trump seated in the middle next to him a was a pastor Brunson and his family on the other side there were senators and members of Congress and secretary of state Mike Pompeo oh who had worked to secure\nFor instance release at one point Brunson said that he wanted to pray for President Trump and he got down on his knees latest hands on the president\nAnd prayed that that President Trump be given supernatural wisdom well what led up to this whole moment yeah so a pastor Brunson was arrested more than two years ago as part of a round up following a coup attempt on Turkish president\n... air to one uh he'd been accused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the past\nExcused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the pastor denies to this day of course um there was a lot of lobbying from President Trump from all those members of Congress the state department and especially vice president Mike Pence worked a lot on this case um Brunson was moved in July to house arrest\nThen that wasn't enough President Trump was not happy about it and in August he imposed sanctions on turkey to try to force the release of Brunson um that released came on friday a and he arrived at joint base Andrews earlier today\nDoes this mean anything for the relationship between the U.S and turkey\nYou know these are two countries that are part of NATO I'm there has seemed to be a pretty good report between President Trump and president air to one uh though Trump set it on a number of occasions that this situation with pastor Brunson was hurting their relationship I'm\nIn the oval office today and also on Twitter President Trump insisted that there was no deal involved here in securing Branson's release a but he did say that it would likely improve the relationship between the two nations you know this comes at a time when the U.S and turkey\nAre trying to figure out how to navigate the disappearance and suspected murder of journalist ... ...\nUm he wrote for the Washington Post and was last seen walking into the Saudi consulate in his stumble up almost two weeks

evangelical Christians uh who took a keen interest in securing his release\nTook a keen interest in securing his release a and even jealous those are a key part of President Trump's base and one other

is elected could become the state's first black female governor activists\nThey're suing cans because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications have been put on hold the majority of those applications belonged to black residents we wanted to learn more about this so we call that mark nice he he's a government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution mark welcome to the program\nThanks for having me All right so why were these voter applications put on\nHold Georgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact match law\nAnd put on hold Georgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact match law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match\nOr pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years\nTo um put voters on pending lists until they could be ... come fully registered and then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law\nThat resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where these civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed\nInto state law now the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind of law including Florida and in Florida any way of federal court upheld their law\nAnd activists are saying that they fly disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case deal\nIt is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in\nOther minority groups in particular which he knows and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities\nAnd Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nBrain can running for governor he's also the sitting secretary of state whose office overseas the voting system does she have a history of getting involved with this kind of issue\nIt depends which side you talk to um be\nHis opponents say that Brian ... is\nPart of this process as secretary of state who's in charge of elections and we have seen precincts close\nWe have seen that there are these voters on pending lists\nAnd we have seen Georgia Pass a photo ID law before you can vote however in Georgia the way our elections work is the secretary of state while he is responsible for overseeing ... elections in enforcing state laws regarding the elections\nMost of election processes are local decisions and so secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easy to vote and follow Georgia's law and\nIn fact this week we reported that Georgia has a record number of registered voters six point nine million including well over two hundred thousand new voters just in the may primary election what's\nThe mood in Georgia right now so close the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and this particular case is motivating Democrats who feel that Republicans\nAre cracking down on voting rights and Republicans are saying that it's a manufactured controversy with I Believe the words that

Nineteen different characters a sex worker from Trinidad a former pimp from South central LA and an elderly Jewish woman from flushing queens what do I think of prostitution\nShit was shooting they admit [noise] what are you about Twenty years old age the use of my God I think I can use in my purse and\nSarah Jones is with me in Studio welcome to the program thank you for having me and us [laughter] we're on the air [laughter] I Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who's object to find women who is a former cop\nWho admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he says never on the clock though you know never ... on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different\nConversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worst than value are determined by my parents and my marketability [noise]\nMy parents and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in queuing day or with social media\nAnd I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have begun smelled on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve earn more\nBut who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and being a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex us as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nThere was definitely this space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show to talk about these characters that human body whether they say to you\nThese characters that you embody whether they say to you oh my gosh I only saw myself and that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accident which is my accent which was my real acts and\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods and goddesses and trans gods of the theater\nAnd of accent and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show\nShe's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people understand that I\nHave a direct connection to them and the republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with our accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignity having accented English actually just means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always hang every character you know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so in the show and us how to do and went to United\nNation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places\nFrom for so long but then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material on\nDuring the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution or commercial sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and she said but he got cracking good job\nShe came to India and he said but he got cracking good job of she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so you know I really try to set my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says\nI feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of a pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is and you talk white you this you that I heard a lot of that and gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one\nFelt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\nThat Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much\nThank you ... oh my pleasure or pleasure\nAnd finally today we are going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called codes which is all about race and identity in America and in our most recent episode we talked about adoption\nSpecifically trans racial adoption most adoptive parents in the U. S. are white and a lot of them are adopting children who aren't as according to the Institute on families studies so we put out a call to those of you who are adopted we wanted to know\nHow did adoption form your sense of racial identity and your sense of self and here's what she told us\nI spent the first twelve years of my life thinking that I was a little white girl and\nWhen I found out that it wasn't it wasn't just revelation it was an identity crisis\nSo really I think it's kind of a lack of identity that ties transnational adopt these together\nThe narrative about my adoption was really centered around my mom being a savior\nMy language my mannerisms my experiences are all informed by the white family I grew up with\nYou told us you feel alone and want to know if there are other people like you out there", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "14"}
