the attack and we will be hearing from members of the community who were directly affected by the tragedy and\nWe'll hear from people who were far away but still felt the need to respond but we're going to start the program with Pittsburgh Mayor Bill but you know Mr Mann thank you so much for talking with us\nIt's my pleasure and of course I Want to offer my deepest condolences to you and to members of the city and the community and you've just last eleven people and how are you holding up and how is the city holding up\nUm it's difficult uh our hearts are broken collectively in Pittsburgh is a community is small a Pittsburgh is a small city and what happens to one part of it affects all of us\nWe'd ask the number of people to describe this community to us and I'm like you to describe it to us what is what a squirrel hill all about\nWell it's um I live five blocks from where are the event took place um it's the most diverse neighborhood and all of western Pennsylvania and it's I'm a very tight knit community that is the historic\nA base of Pittsburgh's Jewish community for over one hundred years\nUnfortunately um events like this are no longer rare in American Life and I wondered when you have seen other communities face something like that\nYou have seen other communities face something like this\nHas it been running through your mind like what would I Do in the situation I mean as you first got the call this the first calls were coming into this with this event is taking place I find myself wondering like what were you thinking and how'd you how'd you thought to yourself who I think that you would have to face something like that\nSo I have a um strategy with my chief of staff on weekends or if he calls I I'm may not pick up on the first time but if he ever calls back\nTwo times all know that it is something that is a crisis it was the first time he's ever had to do that\nAnd during that period I realized that something was very very wrong\nOf within five minutes he was at my house and\nWe were on the scene I'm within five minutes of that so I'm looking at different cities of course there's always tried to learn from other cities and uh one of the examples and I\nHad the opportunity to talk to them era Walsh today was Boston in the Boston Marathon and I'm trying to realize how to get not only the strategy of the police in public safety but also communications\nAnd you know obviously this is early days and you're still dealing with the immediate aftermath and there are many there were going to be some really difficult\n[noise]

I I was just\n... and I heard you read into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat's right I talked to Lisa flesh or Jackson enter nice Eli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmother is no longer with us but I mean I I spend a lot of time in a synagogue this is where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified\nAnd I hope that we could make some some changes it's not just an attack on the Jewish people but it's an attack on\nOn everybody in his community and recover strong and we're going to make it through\nAnd I said she was with her niece who's sixteen Eli they both you know this has many generations with his family have ties to this neighborhood they brought up\nBut the family have ties to this neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials\nWell I wouldn't have\nHad tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and give support to the families that were\nSo what did they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime\nOh I just heard so much sadness so much shock as you always hear in these situations and and we said the the aunt\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun laws\nI think it's not about being definitely need to have ... so we definitely don't need to have you know security guard at our schools at our temples at our church is\nShouldn't have to I mean some are we supposed to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers ought to this but where we go to press on even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here in Reno\nWelfare you've also been getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much\nYeah thanks taxing and ...\nPittsburgh faith communities took time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life synagogue the ... United Methodist church across town open their Sunday services to an interfaith group of worshipers\nAnd the church sanctuary there were eleven white roses displayed at the front one for each of the people killed in yesterday's attack and during the service each name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor Russell should show Lugar said he that he held a ...\nMemory a pastor wrestle ... said he that he held a special service to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters are ... those who were killed ah to offer prayers\nUm but as I mentioned in my my sermons also find our voice\nYou know we often say that we offer our prayers and thoughts and that is funny but we must do more\nWe must put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with our boys and with our actions we can ensure that this hatred is not the new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today I guess yeah\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back on\nMy open and affirming you mean that everything every once in a while because everyone is welcome is actually right everyone is welcome and and normally welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expected we had a couple of\nAh folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer their words of Thanksgiving they did not state to worship but they did come and to say thank you for doing this you know it makes a difference\nI think if I ask you don't seem rattled by this maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I didn't have to wonder you I mean you hear you\nDaughter my youngest daughter carried into for roses in on\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and ...\nRendered her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events because he was a police officer in white whole nuts were the ... a perpetrator lives so it was very frightening pros personally um\nBut I I Try to uh luggage the urge\nTo give me the ... that I Need\nI I Do not fear for myself I guess if I'm honest I fear for my my children my grandchildren\nBut yet I can allow hatred to intimidate me ...\nWe also met lore has she is the nursery attendant at the church responsible for caring for the congregations littlest members during worship and for her yesterday as a tax on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony was beef was being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell this church has recently kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of a situation like that of course is the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind to start here because I'm responsible for\nEight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuating from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I was running through my head penance plans that I've come up for\nYears really and is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened where you thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nI grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school or things like\nDuring about stuff like that tiny how it happened when I was in high school or things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind is kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what's fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plan anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking about\nWe also met a father and son Otis and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today an owner said his own life experiences allow him to feel empathy for Pittsburgh Jewish community\nAnd African American ... we know about how these things are there is the wrong people reserve neighborhoods or people to look at your front of\nA thermometer field are you should be there because a year off of your color\nMassey what about you I get the sense that just resonated with you even though it wasn't this particular attack was directed at\nYou and I just can you just described why that is\nI remember I was looking at the news was yesterday and I thought about reminder says I'm gay and Orlando resonated with me\nI'm also walk in the south Carolina she resident in me because it was people who are religious and they got killed because their their religious and this residents with me because it's it's ... American right to worship\nHow we want to worship when we want to worship in peace\nWant to worship when we want to worship in peace and for someone to come in and just murder them for for ... for loving the same God that they love is is it's just unbelievable to me\nIt helped being here today to helping in China Today so\nWe're altogether morning and it really allowed me to lift up my English and say you know just put it on God's hands\nAnd it gave me hope because as pastor Russell was speaking the sunshine started the shining it's been cloudy all day in Pittsburgh the sun was shining and I I felt like that was God's telling me that you know\nDetails on line at U.

E. S.

Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the of the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and ...\nWhole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\n... sounds lovely now um you also spent some time uh in squirrel hill the neighborhood with this attack occurred what was the mood there [noise]\nYeah I mean people were out and scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going to Sunday services and you can see the diversity of the communities notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the sixth president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC here's what she said\nI came today that\nWaiting patients and now I say I think I'm going to let them read articles on these articles that I Want to sit and talk of the class and just giving them a space a process\nAnd what they thought they were really moved by family meant the Holocaust and weak\nAnd people were saying that you know in a little town like this you'd never think can happen but in today's America they realized it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to that point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was affected how are people absorbing this yeah it's another\nMine who was affected how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I I rented to Dan Franco he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school at the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal here's what he said\n[noise] and they were really special Sweden or who are known for many years and whenever I go to a tree of life for a bar mitzvah or a wedding or\nSome kind of occasions to them are always in the\nIn the sanctuary\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an up tick of hate speech in this country\n... and now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying is next\nI felt like people run this sorrow this sort of cycle of sorrow and then pride in the solidarity that community showing\nAnd then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents but\nThe community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they said he talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about the upcoming elections in and wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence ... thank you thank you and as you\nJust heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this\nThat are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children and how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with\nLike this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in Studio ... thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand you're actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's minds\nAnd fortunately I've covered several of these now and my career as a journalist and you know anytime there isn't a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nAh it's impossible for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified them\nSo you do we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue you also when the other places tell us about that\nActually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great one actually and\nUh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want to place for families to to go and feel safe and comfortable they say\nAnd today was a pretty normal busy day at the museum and and uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too I met a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nThat you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think it's happening here\nShe says she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages four and six we're from Canada so\nIt was very new to us living here for the last year or more prominently\nAlarming across the room at least\nAlarming across the room Alisa\nHoffman was also unsure what to tell her two kids ages six and three about what they're seeing in the news\nIt's hard to [noise]\nPut it into a contract where they understand um [noise]\nYou know so we haven't really talked about it yeah I have to think about how we well Hofmann\nGrew up in the Pittsburgh area and was back here to visit family and like so many here she has ties to the Senate\n[noise] a lot of my\nFriends had by bar mitzvah that tree of life I have\nAttendance Sunday school because my best friend growing up was Jewish and that's where she went so it's just really [noise]\nPricing upsetting disappointing that that\nPeople get these busting their head and and do it [noise]\nYou know and I think that they [noise]\nI think that they can't but they actually\nDevon ... runs the make shop a play and craft area for the kids she says the museum staff\nHas been grappling with how to help children and their parents during this scary time [noise]\nSo today it's hard to be at work\nKnow that we are the helpers here and we are the ones offering support for those families and children while we are also struggling with our own feeling but the way that I'm looking at it is\nYou know we are part of a community together as a tool and I'm being\nWith the community right now deals are important and powerful for me too\nFeels are important and powerful for me to still says today's plant originally focused on Halloween\nBut after the shooting she switched things up and encourage the kids to build models at houses and buildings and other familiar places they care about places that make Pittsburgh home Sarah McCammon NPR News Pittsburgh\n... thank you for that and finally today I reached out to an old friend to give us one more perspective on yesterday's shooting David trip and we used to work together in Washington DC now he is executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nHe lives just three blocks from the tree of life synagogue and he's published too powerful pieces one for his own paper and another for the New York times and he's with us now from his office at the ... and it's good to hear your voice\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and set the hatred must stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign of rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership or here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today I think the president has\nMore of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country and she's she's basically arguing that\nThe president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media uh\nAnd she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nReally seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console learn cheap or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is or when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren\nWhere he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nShe says oh God I Can't do it she doesn't have any Indian blood I Am more than she does that I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence in many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally\nAnd not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the midterm what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views of Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House

sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs well as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general ... who's in charge of northern command\nReno border security as national security and the U.S military will eventually be these capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom ... says something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\nJust goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duties which was transportation aerial surveillance are kind of ...\nTroops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role again no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still they'll do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas ... a barrier is more razor wire fencing a crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also builds camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders and the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only to support role again and the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used in former Confederate States in that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed well some of them will be armed\nMy grants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border uh I don't recall the\nPresident for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who are doing everything again from constructing camps flying border patrol agents\nSo yet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public affairs staff and uh again general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the same number of troops now in Iraq and right and maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said a border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up to speed on the latest developments at the Pentagon thank you

about the problem that affects the state and who's area and and um the ball you can I ask\nRelationships like that or the benefit of incumbency most challengers have to convince voters that they'll

policymakers have been very successful in recent years the evidence lowest\nThe makers have been very successful in recent years the evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment but the fed success has also undermine one of the basic theories that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years that Philips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips curve if you put it in a murder mystery\nFramework who killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kill themselves or\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the feds long persistent focus on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\n... says the Philips curve isn't working but rumors of its death maybe exaggerated\nIt certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly

in which low rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low\nWhat is the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nUs economies extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response Owen thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want low and stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that would confirm your beliefs about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would
