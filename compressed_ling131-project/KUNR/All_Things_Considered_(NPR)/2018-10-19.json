the Justice Department do so one of its jobs is to make sure the cases the OJ attorneys bringing defend and the arguments they make in court or on the line with federal protections for religious freedom\nThat includes making sure our employees know their duty to accommodate the full of fame as the people in this room know you have to practice what you preach\nBut some say the Justice

splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise] you know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends\nBut he's a lot more measured and cautious about it the most Democrats running for Congress this

good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges\nStructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator note that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress that I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them

Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act she was also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump\nMost notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong\nAnd it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes and actions not her occasional statements don't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want\nYou know statements don't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact macadam says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent maybe not even say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keeps his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people for whom party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams but many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey're calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderates ships party dynamics\nEspecially if they're the ones responsible for Democrats winning back power got Detrow NPR News Salt Lake city [noise]\nYou're listening to all

an ad that insurance for the money that you're going to spend on it\nThe state's quake insurance market is still living with the fallout from North ridge and the perception that quake insurance isn't over priced luxury at best many companies simply stopped writing policies after getting stung with nearly twenty billion in Northridge payouts\nAnd for the companies that remain consumer prices soared

G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what happened do you still believe un investigation would be worthwhile would be necessary\n[noise] absolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have all of these competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal details\nOf uh of ... killing and\nThose seem really quite at odds with what a what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a of a fistfight to em seems really um counter to what to do what the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nIs to have a credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by by the un or the secretary general or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation look like how big are we talking how long would it take\nI think we're talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this\nMaybe five individuals could be led by a high profile former prosecutor investigators who have experience with international crimes in criminal investigation and um you know at the very minimum it can involve\nAnalyzing what the what the Turkish authorities have been giving to the news media over the last a week or two or it could involve on site visits a interviews of of officials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks well once it's\nUm who has to call for that\nBut but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks well once it's authorized\nUm who has to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this in motion Mm\n[noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations\nFor for heinous crimes are and comprehensive systematic crimes like crimes against humanity and genocide or they did it in the context of dark for in Sudan several years ago and they've done it and many other places the human rights council could do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject\nTo ah to the veto of\nAny of the five permanent members gonna okay so if the U.S decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary they could block of Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely ... and there's there's a third option to which uh several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary general on his own to authorize a authorizes an investigation and set one up\n[noise] um what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our version of events we don't buy it\n[noise] yeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international lies it would be something that from you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there would be any number of options available to them whether its\nDiplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations or or other kinds of outcomes but but there's nothing binding I'm not talking about how beautiful but we're talking about a credible

Todd ball and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave to ... this idea to build a little library in the first place\nWell Todd's mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled his mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse\nTo honor her and was it a hit right from the start\nActually know very little passed by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Brooks and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always as amazes me is how many people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that say\nI've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people open the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries\nLibraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he was about projects especially those that had to do with the news or people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries has come up this sort of a little spring of hope\nAlong the U.S Mexico border there's a hundred and fifty of them on in prisons in Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda at a hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have\nUp and brought communities together\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to see that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then all you know when I'm Out jogging whenever the next day seeing if somebody's taking it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few books in my car so that when I'm going somewhere if I feel little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he stood out to do\nWell I mean there's so much more to what he's

and I mean we this is something that we have known and suspected now for sixteen days but the Saudi announcement lax total credibility\nThat they have claimed for two weeks that he walked out of the

and then fired tear gas to\nDrive the migrants back President Trump has already weighed in he's think to Mexico for its efforts to stop these so called caravan he has also said he will close the U.S border to these migrants well let's bring in reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala Hi James\nAn early so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calm scene at the border a lot of security but migrants who were masked a few minutes away from the border what what happened today\n[noise] this group of migrants as ... to thousands we don't know exactly how many thousands of migrants so decided they were going to march to bridge that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they\nTo this bridge that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today it was a very chaotic scene but uh you know if I can just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence blocking them from leaving Guatemala they got through that fence thousands of people started walking across this bridge into Mexico Mexico had closed a big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for this caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots or that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using against the migrants and then the gate shut again\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from this father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nDon't see them for what it all up [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out he had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here ... it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you [noise]\nSo I'm back on the Guatemalan side of the border but still writes here uh near the bridge and and several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far have drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right next to a couple of hot or from the Guatemalan Red Cross\nThey're treating people mostly people who are really be hydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the continent\nThe people who are really the hydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the caught Miami's probably four years old has a has a cold rag on his head so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who said suffered a lot of heat stroke a and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the class with Mexican and\nAs you talk to these people went to they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and crossed this bridge\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what they are requesting is from Mexico to let them in as asylum seekers and so they are many of them say we are not going to leave the sprint who are going to block the bridge into Mexico lactose and given the clashes today Mexico\nHas totally closed lips border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to it's close to every one\nA show it's it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we are not going home\nIn ... seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and advance getting to the U.S is is the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position [noise]\nThey they are aware that a Trump does not want to let them into the country but what they say over and over again as we know that his fans but we're asking we are pleading for help because you know whatever Trump parts in front of us what is back at home is worse than whatever Trump can put in front\nThank you for that is James Frederick

all of the justices of the west Virginia state Supreme Court were impeached\nThe reason accusations of lavish office renovations and mismanagement state funds\nBut now just as there impeachment trials

justice Margaret work management\nThe chair calls the acting chief justice feral to the chair\nBut here's the thing the acting chief justice wasn't there in an awkward silence fell over the chamber\nFasting chief justice feral being absent the quarter of appeasement will remain a journal until what's presiding officer is present\nThe impeachment trials came to a screeching halt last week with a ruling from a temporary state Supreme Court the ad hoc bench wrote in an opinion that the charges against chief justice Margaret work meant ... unconstitutional\nThe sixty five page opinion is complicated but here's what you need to know they said the house and overstepped its authority on certain charges and was flawed in its procedure here's West Virginia house speaker Roger ...\nWe believe it it it will do irreparable lasting damage to the cops are like are they will no longer have any separation\n... who helped oversee the impeachment process and as a train parliamentarian says yes it was within the houses power to impeach the justices for what they did with the legislative and judicial branch's at a standoff some are calling this a constitutional crisis others\nI Would

governor to end up in the first proclamation of the special session to make it about the entire Supreme Court attendants like smelled that we're going to getting a little bit of trouble with such a broad based resolution\nHe and other Democrats say the most egregious spinning and questionable behavior came from law for ... not the other four members of the court last week law free was convicted on eleven council federal charges\nYou know what a Republican justice a broke the law and has been found guilty of it and they weren't good with that they weren't just good with that they went further and they wanted to take out the entire court\nWith impeachment trials on hold the Senate says they plan to ask the ad hoc court to reconsider its position the other option would be to start the process all over in the house ... the constitutional law professor says he won't speculate on the outcome\nI'm not very good at projecting what will happen in an instant in situation which is highly politically charged and of course we're on the cusp of an election and uh how that affects decision making is is is rather unpredictable\nWith the situation likely to remain unresolved until after the
