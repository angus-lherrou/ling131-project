speech directed really add to President Trump the U.S is that the the nation that could bring this pressure to bear\nA aired on certainly recognizes that turkey doesn't have the potential to do this on its own and so it really is going to be as you say the United states that is going to have to do this\nOr to one has been quite quiet over the last week and a half and a lot of the information that

ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should first said that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families\nBut it has been for months since the court order why aren't two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification Z\nLike one of the reasons is because the government supported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where are these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country of ... of miles from where the parents are and I would say over two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because we've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperate\nBecause they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child and the U.S to pursue asylum\nOr bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents had criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under standard child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that fight\nSo do you feel you has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents\nWe are the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us

products that women can live without so for example we don't tax food obviously people need food they have to eat they need nurses Mitt these are products that women need as well so to put that tax on they're really kind of puts them at a burden when it comes to taking care of things that they need\nBut opponents of the measure disagree haw says that they're concerned it would shrink the tax base\nAnd this is when anytime you talk about eliminating a tax on any good or any product it will mean less money at the end of the day and our reserves and then you always have the question of

busy\nWe're going to take a look now at some of the president's latest claims with NPR's Scott Horsley hey there Scott I already first let's talk about the caravan of Central American migrants the president has been talking a fair bit about that\nThey're making their way to Mexico and hopes of reaching the U.S border I'm now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family's looking for a better life what is he saying instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly you have people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and Tom not letting them in\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty word for word from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nAh there's no evidence\nSay they have not seen any middle Easterners in that\nGroup ah there's no evidence then of Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nIllegal immigration and the threat of terrorism had been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first launched his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear on his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\nThe\n\nCommon sense [noise]\nAnd then third on that Leslie was a tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republicans thought would be the first thing that that tax cut they passed in twenty Seventeen but we hadn't been hearing too much about what's going on\nThe UP tax cut is not warn terribly well right now is pulling at about forty percent approval uh a lot of people maybe don't feel like they've seen a big jump in their own take home pay there's also been some renewed attention paid to the federal deficit which has ballooned as corporate tax revenue shrank\nThe president believes he has a fix for this though and it's another tax cut I Want to play a piece of tape from his rally in Houston last night already but I have to warn you take this message with a big grain of salt\nWe're going to be putting in a tent for tax cuts for middle income families is going to be [noise]\nNow whenever you might think about the merits of another tax cut Congress certainly is not going to be take any action on that next week they're not even session till after the election and what's more nobody outside the White House seems to know

three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention\n... considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nCountry has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in right after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast\nThe vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAlright so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue I've been reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn his role in some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted into into recycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\n[noise] um we want election and administrators\nAnd in ministry leaders to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election processes we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of ah laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned sort of an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I\nI think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that was a enacted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much uh but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nUm many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it\nBut having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place [noise] you know ... is head\n... existed in the first place ... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank you for speaking\nWith all things considered thank you\n[noise] there are few subjects that can divide families more quickly than politics can mother against father father against sun sun against daughter will you get the idea\nAnd then there's this today well relatives of Adam

shorter the family dinners got and\nPerhaps unsurprisingly the people who seem most hurt by these conflicts aren't the partisans on either side it's the family members caught in the middle\nIn Arizona
