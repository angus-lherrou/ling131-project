Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro many people in the U.S auto industry are breathing a sigh of relief this week the new trade deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada and months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd will soon as senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies that make auto parts here in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well injured after we've ...\nTrey has actually done quite well under NAFTA we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but he counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved to that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required for parts to travel through the three countries are going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs\nThere's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum\nA so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before the finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be ... material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have the mind is the up and that particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent so this is a significant increase it's typically of ...\nFat so this is a significant increase its particularly of concern between Canada the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement just is worse well\nI think from the United states perspective one of the things in the United states is able to pull through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral looming them that's from North America and our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have is the administrators cost and we're gonna have to work really hard with all three parties to minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move forward that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of the mode on equipment Manufacturers Association thanks for speaking with us today\nThank you it's a pleasure\n[noise] [noise]

chemicals in surface waters around the landfill since then traces of these industrial toxins have also turned up in nearby wells\nOfficials are still working to pinpoint where the chemicals come from

department's internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the d._a. chess inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel hey also it you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration well it's\nIn this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration well it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important to note that these miners are very well taken care of I don't believe that they are very well taken care of it\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that the age as held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and assistant after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere's no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could was with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nHa chess by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time da just said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general fine that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some ...\nChildren the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids\nAt all since then what happened\nTo those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that that authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa chest does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies\nAre there any children who still hadn't been reunited with their parents [noise]\nOh yeah more

Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes ... may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them buy from the ... and then told me what exactly to do first and then ... sending your request for ... for them to fill out and then I filled out the\nAnd that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out and then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived it had been pre filled by the presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand the characters bases that they allowed\nSo you felt that this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I waited by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think one should lie in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or what has taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony desperate in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic lie was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black yeah I think Britain me confused that was passing out but the black neon phrase means doing things that you don't know you you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to that condition how can one no\nLet me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation from you\nThat represent a complete thorough investigation from your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about like new three eighty four eighty five at your college\nAnd then held that was spoken about in two thousand and

considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created that healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this hike artist hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more well\nMy favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just a share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nYou're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate\nWork uh and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a higher rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional in business services there isn't like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that\nThis for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that there are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there were more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but they're also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy is more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth that's been kind of sluggish in the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set\nA it makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's part of Garcia co

the Supreme Court that could be over soon as the Senate prepares for a procedural vote tomorrow and possible final vote on Saturday\nAll today senators have been taking turns viewing one copy of the FBI report its latest investigation into Kavanaugh following allegations of sexual assault against the nominee Democrats have criticized the investigation as incomplete an rushed\nRepublicans including Susan Collins and Jeff Flake who could decide Kavanaugh's fate have described it as thorough we're joined now by Senator Patty Murray Democrat of Washington who has said she'll vote no on Kavanaugh welcome back to\nAll things considered well nice to talk today I understand you've seen the report can you give us your reaction [noise]\nWell I was really frustrated and disappointed by the report that we were given a clearly the FBI was told to very narrow the scope of people that they talk to I Can't tell you what is in the report but I can tell you that a credible number of\nPeople that both I'm Dr Ford and Mr Mir as gave to the FBI or that could corroborate their stories were not interviewed you say\nYou said the affair was clearly told to narrow the report the White House and Republicans in the Senate have said the FBI was given no restriction\nI Know from the FBI's that they are when they're told to be allowed to be very thorough following leads wherever they are to take them to conclusions and from what I saw today in the narrow scope\nAnd from what I saw today in the narrow scope that they've given um that that could not have been accomplished particularly because we know that the names of people that both ... and Dr Ford gave them were not followed up nor were a number of tips that came into the FBI and so\nRepublicans have said today that there is nothing in the report corroborating the allegation of get a gal allegations against Kavanaugh sounds as though you're saying true but only because they didn't look for them\nWell I mean that's part of it and um and what we do know about um\nSituations like this where someone is a victim of sexual assault that they often do not tell anybody in the room I've talked to so many people say it has absolutely no surprise that Dr Ford didn't tell anybody at the time in fact she told us that\nHow traumatized she wasn't it wasn't really until years later or where she told a therapist or her husband talked about it\nI've had so many women tell me their stories in the airport in the grocery store over the last week or so\nThat that's exactly what happened to them and I think those have to be credible and understood that ... if you want to get a correct response and understand the full story you can't just ask someone who is in the house at the time\nI Know there's been a lot of frustration on both sides of the aisle about how this has been handled elsewhere in the program we spoke with Senator Mike rounds of South Dakota and here's part of what he said\nThe Senate is supposed to be advise and consent and then this particular case for a strong feeling up here the Republicans are the Democrats simply decide this was going to be a search and destroy mission\nFrom day one so there's a

describes hacks against sports stars and against anti doping agencies in the U.S and in Canada\nIt also says Russians targeted a Dutch group that was studying the poison used to try and kill a former Russian spy\nNPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson was asked the Justice Department today she is most days and she is back\nHere in the studio now with details you carry I mean okay so tell me more about the Russian intelligence officers being charged unwind now what's the timing yeah the defendants are setting current Russian military officers today's charges include conspiracy and money laundering a few of us\nThe charges include conspiracy and money laundering a few of the defendants are also charged with wire fraud or identity theft court papers say some of the cyber activity here started in twenty fourteen when allegations about Russia cheating to avoid drug tests for the Olympics first came to light\nBut some of the behavior extended up till this summer in twenty Eighteen oh so it's just a very ... yeah when the hackers were in touch with reporters who wanted access to documents these hackers got their hands on now I gather all of\nViews seven Russian officers are in Russia or are there is no us extradition treaty in place so\nWhy bother charging them well FBI officials point out sometimes they get lucky these guys traveled to European countries where there are extradition treaty is in place but even if that doesn't happen the D. O. J. says its practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers\nAmerica knows how to find them and describe what they did and sometimes other parts of the government impose sanctions on individual hackers or the people who fund them\nThe assistant attorney general for national security John ... told reporters that Russia launched the cyber effort because it was embarrassed by allegations than it's athletes\nWere of eating drug test\nEmbarrassed by that truth Russia fought back by retaliating against the truth tellers and against the truth itself\nNow Mary Louise the Justice Department says it's exposing those activities and that this indictment\nThe real story I was asking you earlier about the timing of these charges carry and I have another question along those lines the U.S announced these charges just hours after Britain and the other one's announced their own accusations against Russians is that coincidence or coordinated very much coordinated the chest\nIncidents or coordinated very much coordinated the Justice Department actually fainted international law enforcement partners for their help\nAt the press conference here in D.C today they highlighted how the Dutch were actually able to disrupt the hacking plot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passport traveled to the Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife fi networks there but\nThe Dutch we're on to them so the men abandoned the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw was examining a substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. this year ... exactly I mean\nHere's here's my big question which is what to these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against democratic servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterms from further Russian interference\nVideotape wouldn't touch that question today but there is something worth pointing out here\nThe new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which begs the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning the DOT actually had a warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these hacks it can be false are misleading or the hackers can have a sinister motive as the Russian government allegedly did\n... can have a sinister motive as the Russian government allegedly did in this case NPR's Carrie Johnson thank you my pleasure\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court could come down to the votes who just a handful of senators they\nAre weighing that decision after getting a look
