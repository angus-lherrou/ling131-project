Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made a pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely to moral as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there and\nI'm Mary Louise so we're my me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nHis pastor around a small church in is near and western turkey for years and years ah but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected or enemies and Brunson was caught up in the basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do\nBrunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to Gulen turkey blames for that coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless\nBut he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now and then today in court we had three witnesses who would testified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that incensed a little over three years in jail but then the judges basically suspended the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why really ... him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump's thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously in the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release a pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue of the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nAnd that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia here and just tumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nThe democracy Yogi case right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from assemble we can take\nThe next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nTrail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price two of the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent\nI had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one free does is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machine Scott uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted to offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost the Fritos has gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nHow naive to think that's all that's in a bag of Frida is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do with well food prices counts as a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos\nThe trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of free does might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies I Know one of them um because of the parent has gone up as well\nSo because of like the aluminum cans\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nOf all the companies Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke just raised the price of their drinks to offset is more expensive can but they can't really do that right now sales of so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking him growing category unlike many of the other food categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so their news trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nMet with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie catch the indicator from Planet Money\nWhat Planet Money comes from the transfer why [noise] a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore at transfer wise dot com or from their ...

athletic ran whom I is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic collide\nThat was a shoe that was made famous by New York Knicks great walk Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a in Ninety eight and it was very short lived they aren't just one clear and a quarter and yoga broker after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years ago when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nElements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hasn't so I'll come with a big part of the appeal\nWith typing in with the players are today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also it's a complex thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big way in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how much do they have now to get a big name behind him\nWell but how much do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able\nTo attract people like Michael Jordan and the\nPrime gene is ... even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdles for any newcomer\nYeah um you know I did a lot of research last year like you had about sixty percent of the week wearing their shoes last oh okay step in and combat that is pretty tough to bind okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSix the talk Fifteen draft picks this year along with an darned about end to mark his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like ... like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball ... business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the ... is a big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have said could see that in ... made a kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue banned in what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching lots and lots of folks who are a game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on Instagram and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys that pulled aside and they have six\nAnd they put the highlights on his grandmother things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys on the sun they have six and a half million followers on Instagram so that's why this huge base of the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really winning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their new is that they don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for sure\nNick DiPaolo covers the athletic she industry
