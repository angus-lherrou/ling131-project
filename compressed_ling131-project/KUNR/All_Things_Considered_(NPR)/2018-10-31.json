Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week to go before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic in his immigration crackdown\nThe president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution in an interview with X. CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress now they're saying I can do and just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose how dull hey our first just fact checked for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here's what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century\nAnd the children were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship they argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot end birthright citizenship within ...\nToday and said flatly that you cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as excited on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House his critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days while the president has definitely been talking\nA lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico no question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration and that this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nOne more statement from the president on this that I'd like you to fact check Trump says the U.S is out of step with the rest of the world and that it is the only country to allow birthright citizenship is that true\nHighs near sixty by Thursday sixty three friday sixty seven agrees with lots of sunshine for the whole area [noise] through the end of the week [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro black women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energize\nYou know we recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates and more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country and how do you go around and he hit the women around the circle\nHere in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts there were sipping wine munching on tacos ... reading about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled then they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hat that followed the presidential election\nThink the ... by the\nThink that's the trust was gone by the women's march Iraq have not showing up is calling\nFrom or this is Michelle nearly she works in communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did tip in favor of Donald Trump\nWhite women activism posed twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly as opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters would be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nUm and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past\nEspecially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who delivered that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc\nIt's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... he's the hard way from family we show what is\nWhat is the last\n... why why\nWe can do it and that list of issues important to black woman\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Rebekah Brooks brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being a real man and woman had a choice we had a stronger voice there's would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing I ...\nI asked Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well or\nReligious in the middle of it because I was in the ... the other police officers say something\nLive whole he fits the profile\nAnd I'm like my dad is the suit my brother's history there are all star game we use\nEvery day and in the profile\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything Rebekah Brooks resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara ... right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress\nTo be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd some black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nBlack women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny cost\nFought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB seeds are directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this was a new day this is the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and\nWay doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank you\nTomorrow a conversation with Ayanna Pressley herself with no major opposition at her Massachusetts district Presley

views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition that\nThere was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and\nSo he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally\nTour bus again went on a media spree asking for users and explicitly tied this then to the white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with Twitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check mark from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these\nInstances ... was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social

living in motels according to the alliance for the homeless\nStock about what homelessness looks like here in our community Kaye when our Stephanie's Renault sat down with Nico Colombian\nAnd instructor at the Reynolds school of journalism and the lead organizer up our town Reno ... reporting organization that focuses on exposing the resolving revolving issue of homelessness here in Reno\nSo part of what our town of Reno dies is document homeless stories why is this important to do so\nThat our time Reno we believe every story is valuable every single voice uh deserves to be heard\nTo look at different populations that don't necessarily get their voices are stories out there in the mainstream media and to really focus on giving their perspective as Reno is changing as Reno's rebranding that it's important to also give the voice of the people that are being the most impacted\nAnd within that these last couple of years are you seeing the numbers increase in Reno\nWell it's always hard to get different numbers but there are some recent numbers for example let's say that four thousand people are living\nLet's say that four thousand people are living in motels currently in Reno\nOr the homeless numbers are always hard to to figure out there's data from the Washington County school system about how many of their students are not housed properly and their numbers are usually in the three thousand range these are are the students themselves another interesting stats are that has come up recently is that Nevada ranks last\nIn or access to affordable housing for the poorest segment of society so we have very alarming numbers here in Reno in Nevada\nRent that far double housing hijacked by the impacts on homelessness and the city as a whole\nAll linked together so ah there's a fight on blight and there are demolishing a lot of motels and motels have often become a a last resort housing for people who can't afford a the cheaper apartments uh you know they have bad credit or you know they can't afford first month last month deposits\nOr they have a pet they want to live with you know different scenarios but so some people live in motels which are being torn down and sometimes they have no solution rather than becoming homeless affordable housing you know some people\nAre are living in an apartment and then they remodeled the apartment or the prices go up and they are on fixed income we have a lot of senior citizens\nWho are on fixed income from the government we have a lot of a disabled neighbors who are on six disability income and once uh they can't afford any more sometimes they'll live with roommates or sometimes they they're lucky enough to find some the section eight housing\nBut sometimes these dominoes start falling\nBut sometimes these dominoes start falling uh the prices rise and they can't afford anything anymore\nWhat are some of the next conceptions revolving around homelessness\nWell a lot of people think about the homeless problem that it's their problem that it's the city's problem but fundamentally the problem of the person who is not well house also ah it can happen to everyone and a lot of the people we interview it's often\nA you know a healthy situation which goes wrong they can't pay the bills anymore and they fall into homelessness or a lot of the homeless\nAre victims of severe trauma in their life uh there's a lot of women who escape are very abusive relationships and who end up on the streets\nAnd then it's very difficult once you are on the streets once you start losing your ID or papers uh once you don't have any possessions really anymore to really dig yourself out of that hole and some of the other misconceptions for example is you know\nUh the the the use of shelters and some people just don't do well in the shelter environment but there are just some people\nWho are just don't coped very well when they're surrounded by so many people in a very structured environment so there are some people who who prefer to to live along the river\nWhat are the dangers that surrounds house less or homeless people in Reno\nBut basically when you lack proper housing you're in just a much more a precarious state we're approaching winter uh you know your your body is much more frail when you're out in the elements all the time you have no privacy uh you're also much more prone to attacks from others who abuse from others are so it's just\nEverything is just more difficult when you don't have house\nEverything is more difficult when you don't have housing our whole society is built on this this concept of you know being house so you you're different than other people\nSo it becomes very difficult don't be afraid when you see a homeless person to talk to them for a few minutes to give them a smile to give them a hug don't be afraid of when you walk by the motel to rather\nWalk on the other side of the sidewalk go into the motel for a second and say hello to one of your neighbors you know these are part the people who live in motels of the people who are homeless are part of our community there not a different community\nThank you so much

will actually say that they believe we could come to a civil war again in the United states but then she said\nMany people back off from their initial conclusions they do say no I don't I don't really believe that will have a civil war but I find some of what I see happening frightening enough to think of it\nThat way modern civil conflicts don't have to involve marching armies are Pickett's Charge conflicts emerge when episodes of political violence become more sustained so could happen in our era here's ... again I came\nOf age during the Vietnam War so I came of age in a time in which differences on policy issues did lead to violent civil protest that didn't lead to blood in the streets so I Do I Believe this is possible it's part of my own life experience\nAnd the concept of a civil war is seeping out into the open especially on the right\nThe civil war and America's horizon reads the headline in last month's the American conservative and on town hall dot com a Trump supporter imagine how a civil war would turn out in why Democrats would lose the second civil war to the extremes\nThat's would lose the second civil war to the extreme fringe has also picked up on

job in the works for search for common ground a nonprofit that tries to reduce political violence abroad in places like Burundi Congo and Yemen\nPrior to to some of these conflicts erupted you see a a drop in the capacity to deal with one another and and to focus on one of the prevailing identity the sense that you can't necessarily interact or all work together with someone from a different an identity group\nThat's something we see here ah you know in the U.S as we look at some of the partisan political divisions\nThe way to prevent disagreements from becoming violence according to experts in civil conflict is to be more open to those with whom we disagree\nThe biggest challenge that many people have in in their own lives is really taking the first step to not when you disagree with someone to listen first that's job and again I think as you look at the U.S today we're entering a period of of conflict but you know even if conflict is inevitable violence is not\nVote the way we

Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices I slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nAre the economic envy of the entire world what on me\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the pain so just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China in the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten use six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade limb to limb and economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen the un fall if it's because people are selling it and buying dollar\nRight and so the question is why they selling it and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand\nMeanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker the strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on ...\nOne year the strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe cameras I'll watch will increase the costs of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't stay well partly counteracted\nTrump has so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact\nLim says the following you on may also have another impact foreign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and below project\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're said to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the

with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust into its banking and financial system and part of this was involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near when it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nSoon after when loud one went to his bank she found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and

deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt\nWell it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about
