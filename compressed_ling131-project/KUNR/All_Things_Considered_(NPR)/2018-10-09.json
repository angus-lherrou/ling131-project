Reagan appointee and generally conservative he occasionally sided with the court's liberal wing most\nFamously in a string of gay rights cases but also for example reaffirming abortion rights

Blackburn\nShe also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB he writes an onus from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past\nWe reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how on earth shattering is is this the Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\nHonestly in an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore [laughter] really a surprise tell me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because ah for the last few years there has kind of been a steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment\nAnd she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram post with really lengthy almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people got to really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so [laughter]\nThey kind of had read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political ...\nOf free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nDid in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now her songs are being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have a broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has his country than she did still want to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to to reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nAnd this is what I've been trying isn't the mystery of the day\nAnd [laughter] I always said I her mind immediately Beckley\nTaylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out and like she didn't say what those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most was her\nSexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her in and meet and greet line\nAnd she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up ...\nStraight line and she

he's running with an endorsement from the human rights campaign this is his first state wide elections\nAn interesting point of contention in this race is voter fraud and voter id last year ... open investigation against the DMV about alleged voter fraud or a whole has been critical of for lack of communication on the investigation\nAlso ... has voiced their support on voter id which is a hotly debated topic in the state or all hasn't taken a stance yet but he said he's going to take a closer look at the issue right so what about the treasury office\nThe state treasuries essentially the

office Conan ran for a state assembly seat back in Vegas\nAnd ran for state assembly seat back in Vegas in two thousand sixteen but he lost in the primary\nBob Baer's is much more experience in

campaign both candidates have tackled the issue of marijuana banking and are mostly in agreement that dispensaries need to stop handling large amounts of cash and have easier access to banks\nAnd finally Tony Little bit about the controllers office what about that race\nSo the controller is essentially the state's main account and there is possible for the state's final on it and settling claims made against the state run connect is the current controller he's seeking reelection\nHe took office in two thousand fourteen after winning pretty easily given his experience in the public and private sectors he's being challenged by Democrat Catherine Byrne who ran unopposed in her primary\nShe's worked as a CPA and the private sector but this is their first foray into government the main difference between their platforms is burn supports collective bargaining for state employees while connect doesn't given the nature of this position and the historical data connection have any trouble keeping a seat\nNow one thing that all of these races have in common is that they're all down ballot races in ... so there's there's going to be some attrition there's going to be a decrease in the number of voters in each race or how do you think that's going to affect the results collection that\nVoters are going to turn out for governor Senate serious about questions but you're very

to come out\nAnd one or more you know let me ask you what was your pitch to students last night how do you get young people to come out to vote what do you say\nWell I think first of all you have to let them know that number one their vote counts um you have to let them know that they have to be concerned about a more than just the sport that basically\nAll athletes that you were talking to\nYou know it was all athletes okay I'm a I think it's important for Applebee's to use their platform and in the right way\nBut more so than just getting out of all I think you have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for a lot of the time the state and local elections that are sometimes even more important than your presidential elections because those elections that are really affect your age that they like\nWell I Hope everybody saying safe down there now you have been active across a bunch of friends those the op ed that that you co wrote over the summer along with several other pro football players or this was urging President Trump to use his clemency power to try to make a dent in the federal\nPrison population which leads me to ask a fairly basic question that but what just seems like getting out the right to vote or presidential pardon power has to do with football I mean why do we need to hear from from the NFL on these issues\nWell I I don't think it's so much of hearing from the NFL but I Do think you'd want to hear from the players who aren't everyday citizens just because we're Applebee's doesn't mean that we're not affected by the laws of the land doesn't mean that our family members are affected by what's going on\nThere been a number of very high profile other athlete activists also fighting social injustice but doing it in a different way from you

together\nWell I think you know sometimes there's different ideas of how to go about making sure what I Will say that no matter how you decide to go about it I think all of the work is that they're doing is important to work that we're doing as a coalition is important um and we're all working towards the same car\nWhat changes do you want to see inside the NFL\n[noise] what I Want to be as unrealistic and that was the people's hearts change towards these issues there's a lot of people trying to deny what's really going on and I thought\nI think if I had a way everybody was the thing I Want to see that there is a specific group of people in our country does not treated fairly and I would be for everybody feed him for everybody to work together and come up with solutions to try to work\nDo you support the ready to current players to take a knee during the anthem\nOf course if we're I think for me in the NFL is a peaceful protests when I'm outside of the protests that if you have to go into the war protest in during the national anthem only brings attention issues\nBut then after you bring hunting for the issues you have to go out and address the issues and do the work to
