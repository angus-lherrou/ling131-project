in ... in for Michel Martin\nWe're going to start the program in Florida where relief efforts are underway in areas hit by hurricane Michael access to food water and other supplies is still a challenge NPR's Joel Rose has been there reporting for the last couple of days Joel what have you seen\nI've seen long lines for gas for food for water um for all sorts of basic supplies are as people are are trying to come back into their homes and and clean up after the storm\nBut you know in long lines is an improvement because earlier in the week you couldn't find any of those things in Panama City or any of the surrounding suburbs\nUm so you know we are seeing an emergency response really start to step up and get these things out to people but it's it you know it remains a challenge to find some to get supplies into some of the hardest hit areas\nI'm In the suburbs to the east of Panama City and also up into rural inland communities that were hit really hard by the storm um that are a little more difficult to reach so are you know the emergency response is getting underway but I'm sure it's going to be awhile before it reaches everybody who is affected\nAnd communication is still really tough in places where phone services down the Internet's down how has that affected rescue effort\nThink it has been a real problem I mean cell phone service ... those ...\nI think it has been a real problem I mean cell phone service those non existent for days after the storm and it's still really spotty I'm In Panama City in the surrounding county\nAnd it's difficult because people can't coordinate the emergency response it's hard to\nYou know tell people where to go if you can't communicate with them and it's also making it really difficult for people to call their family members and check in and say hey I you know I'm OK I'm here you know I Need this or that kind of supply or even just I'm Alive you know I mean emergency crews are going door to door to try to\nYou know figure out who survive the storm and who didn't and and I have to think it would be a lot\nIt it must be slowing this effort down for them not to be able to communicate with people by cell phone or anywhere almost anywhere in Bay county so it's um I think it's been a real hindrance to the relief effort\nAnd sent me as an estate do you have power back but there are a lot of places they still don't have power you have any idea when that's going to change\nWe got some new information today from the local utility Gulf Power they're saying that Ninety five percent of their customers in Florida will have power back by October twenty fourth\nIf they are ready to receive it and that is key because not all of them will be in the storm did a lot of damage to people's electric boxes and the wires that connect to their houses and all kinds of things like that [noise]\nUm but that said that's two weeks after the storm made landfall and that would be a huge accomplishment considering that you know devastation to the electrical infrastructure all over Panama City in the suburbs I mean there are electric pulled down everywhere\nAnd lines in the street you can't drive anywhere without driving over electric lines and uh you know so ... is a giant maps and if they could have power back to much of the county and\nSo ... is a giant mess and if they could have power back to much of the county and

in ... a controversial affirmative action case begins Monday in Boston and activists on both sides of the issue we're out protesting today [laughter]\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Harvard University discriminates against Asian an Asian American applicants and\nHere to tell us more is carry young she's a reporter with member station WNPR in Boston have very high I mean first what are the arguments being made in the case\nWill students for fair admissions the group that filed this lawsuit will be trying to prove essentially for things in this case first they say that Harvard illegally uses a quota system or racial balancing in admissions\nHe uses a quota system or racial balancing it admissions\nThey see the admissions rates for each demographic group or two similar from year to year a second the group is arguing that Harvard admissions is considering race too much or that it's a deciding factor and not just a factor of a factor like affirmative action policy actually allows\nThe group also thinks that Harvard hasn't adequately explored admissions methods that don't use race they say that you really can still get a diverse class by considering things like geography and socioeconomic status\nBut as you mentioned the biggest delegation here is that Harvard is intentionally discriminating against Asian Americans in this application process\nAnd there'll be trying to prove this with a lot of statistical analysis actually but it basically boils down to an argument where\nThey'll try to show that while Asian American applicants do have the highest academic qualifications or\nGPA standardized test scores things like that and that they consistently or in lower personal scores from the admissions department and a a personal score is a number that Harvard assigns applicants to to write things like personal essays\nLetters of recommendation and even the amount of personal hardship that someone faced\nBut the person behind this lawsuit is an Asian American raid his name is Edward Blum can you tell us more about him\nThat is true yes Edward Blum is the president of students for fair admissions and that is the group that technically brought this lawsuit um and this isn't Edward blooms first court case attacking affirmative action policies in higher education he's also spearheaded the lawsuit behind Fisher versus the University of Texas\nThe lawsuit behind Fisher versus the University of Texas which he ultimately lost as you remember in the Supreme Court in twenty sixteen now we did reach out to bloom for an interview a before trial but he declined\nWe did speak with someone who is close to him Ilya Shapiro who's a he's a constitutional fellow at the Kato Institute\nHe explained blooms perspective to me this way do you\nAs a as a society we're already doesn't matter where government treats us all the same regardless it's got a caller archer Asian American applicants and students are for her because the last star illustrates the problem is\nWhat does Harvard have to say\nWell Harvard is standing behind their admissions policies and they say they don't have a quota pointing to the fact that in the last five years they have admitted about twenty nine percent more Asian applicants\nHarvard's legal team will also be presenting data that refuse the plaintiffs analysis over those lower personal scores\nAnd W. B. U. R. spoke with Harvard's new president Larry back out over the summer a belt this lawsuit and well he couldn't comment on us specifics he did say that diversity is important to the school and that a lot of factors are considered in the admissions process\nThings Carrie thank you carry young is the senior education reporter for member station WBFO you are in Boston\nThe twenty Eighteen McArthur

you're always you know moving with this kind of momentum are are pushing back against the momentum and and poetry to me feels a lot like that I feel tension and I feel pressure and I feel like\nFeels

I Know best and I trust least you can't hide from language like in every word the violence that that language has carried or the violence that language has enacted is carried and that word that is one of the powers of poetry is that\nI can use Spanish when that's the word I feel in my in my body I can use Mojave language here when I feel it you know to be able to call myself\nWho I Am in Mojave is for me to call myself into existence in a way whereas for me to say Native American you know which we all say for clarity sake but for me to say Native American in a way I'm I'm already racing myself you know because what I Am is something that is\nYes part of this America but also something else something more on something that America hasn't quite been able to consume fully\nYeah that was a poet

minor infractions those violations can have ...\nPunished disproportionately from minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement he was do\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states in all but two women get this window higher rates than men what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rules at rates we estimated often two to three times higher for what prisons classify\nAs smaller fraction petty stuff you can get written up for a not closing indoors

[noise] it's just basically everything you get written up for\nOur numbers showed that in California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying an order and more than twice as many for what's called disrespect\nIn Vermont we found women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments in Rhode Island they get more than three times the tickets for disobedience\nThose tickets have consequences women lose good conduct credits that kind of time at it to their stay in prison or lose bone in visitation privileges or go to solitary confinement in Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to end up in solitary confinement for disobedience\n[noise] prisons were built for men and the rules for

it's a profoundly different experience we\nMet Benno sunny day she was visiting Logan Correctional Center a women's prison in Illinois several years ago this was a top official in the Illinois department of corrections now she works with prisons as a consultant she helps them address that problem of why women in prison get discipline more\nWomen are more communicative when you walk through a prison there more emotional they want to talk to you they want to talk about their children there want to talk about their experiences\nTwo years ago they notice helped conduct an audit about women's prison in Illinois and found that women prisoners were disciplined almost twice as often as men for all offenses big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor insolence\nAnd they also really if they seen injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix the problem\n... told us she likes it that women prisoners are this way but\nShe said many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say they hate it\nThe first thing that they'll tell you is these women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nCorrections officers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women push back that's where those disciplinary tickets for influence come in to

she says she got in trouble for cursing at a guard when her soul mate who had diabetes passed out we've solved the officer was too slow to help\nWilliams says the hardest thing was when she lost her

average many women had no days added but some ended up with months even a year or more of extra time [noise]\nA small number of states including Illinois or trying to change this they're trying what's called gender response of corrections practices it's built around the idea that women are in prison for different reasons than men that they respond differently in prison\nAnd that prison rules need to recognize those differences and the less punitive\nInshallah now now that that don't\nHave that prison in Illinois a trainer at the front of a class ... tells corrections officers to think through

all she can do is write a letter home or to her son school\nIt's reminder to the corrections officers that tickets even ones pro lesser offenses can have significant consequences reporter Jessica public back meant officers at that training they didn't want to give their names they said the gender response of approach makes sense to them but that many of their co workers are much more skeptical\nI was a lot of heard a lot of things but\n[noise] I was a lot of the I heard a lot of things but\nWhich has been worthless we're going to work as a hug is a big\nHug a thug Mets a derogatory way of saying it's letting the inmates run the prison we wrote letters to some of the women that pat Illinois prison\nOne woman who wrote back said that since the training started she's not

say anything back they send you the segregation for threats and intimidation\nThe number of women in prison is rising but still they're only about seven percent of the prison population nationwide so
