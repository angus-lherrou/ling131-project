they've been exchanging compliments for a while it it really picked up after ... war the make America great again hat on Saturday Night live which was controversial\nAnd west had a lot of praise for Trump in the oval office here's some more of what he had to say\nWhat I mean Saturday Night live to prove auto it on the liberals improve on as if he'd all of\nWe don't look good this is our presidents\nWest was joined at that meeting by legendary football player Jim Brown and and try really he talks about west in brown on a regular basis\nOr because they are two of his highest profile African American supporters are and Trump claims that west coming out in support of him has boosted his standing in the African with the African American community\nAnd now Trump has an offered any real evidence of that but that's what he says and what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter\nAnd uh what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter is he will mention Kanye West or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and these other economic indicators that are better for black people and he basically said that people like west and brown quote\nGet it and they see the benefits of backing him\nOkay so how about the conversation do we even know what they talked about today I think we're supposed to talk about a lot of things in some of them very serious like investing in urban communities addressing crime and violence to Chicago and about clemency and on the issue of clemency in criminal justice reform\nOf those have been priorities for none other than Jared Kushner and the White House\nUh and because of that focused there's some overlap with him of West interests\nUh Kim car dash in West or his wife has already been

cold cases so young ... early kept the company my heritage wondered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful the these techniques to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA from more than one point two million people in this company's data base and discovered something startling for more than sixty percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person in the debate as it because that illuminate hundreds of these things where the ... so it's enough to have your third cousin or your second cousins once removed in the debate that too\nOh your second cousins once removed in the debate as to actually identify you the same way that a GPS system you there's multiple satellites to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and how old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological records you need to do the work but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify are supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on a National Institutes of health research database raising questions about how ... the supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese techniques doesn't only can get you criminals all you can catch criminals with these technique but you can also used this technique for other purposes maybe purposes that could be illegitimate\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police come in the in using these techniques to find these really like you know ... and\n... people but uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that lifted DNA behind a wheel K with his foreign governments are going to exploited these techniques\nTo identify us citizens for their own purposes so that there are many scenarios that you can think about me even\nNow many people defending the use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... labs which helps police solve crimes is way\nWorking on these cases that you haven't been able to be solved\nHelps police solve crimes is way we're\nWorking on these cases that you haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're horrific murders of children things like that it just [noise] [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd great tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is in New York University law\nProfessor if it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your distant cousins for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure it is an misused Rob Stein NPR News

CNN reporter Kate than it was on that trip traveling with the first lady and she joins me here now I have allowed\nSo to be clear this was an official trip she was traveling as first lady us taxpayers we're footing the bill for\nExactly this was her first big sort of goodwill tour so to speak and what was the agenda\nWell I mean she said she was there to spread the message about the best which has her initiative and the welfare of children and she also worked with the u._s._a. ID\nOn some of the programs there are putting your ID the U.S agency for international development exactly as as you partnered with them on the trip you know it's also cultural tour she wanted to learn more about tourism in Egypt for example\nIt was again sort of a broad based initiative but she and that was her undertaking just awkward\nBecause her husband is known for his America First agenda for wanting to slash foreign aid and their shoes on a trip highlighting all the good the American foreign aid is was that awkward\nIt's that strange sort of juxtaposition between the first lady and what she does and the president and what he does write this is sort of like raised eyebrows and also just going to Africa that earlier this year he was accused of\nUm perhaps ... derogatory comments about what she wanted to do is say here is what this organization is doing and in spite of budget cuts just you know the idea is to help these countries get off of the need for our aid so certainly didn't feel awkward when we were there\nBut ahead of time it was a head scratcher\nHer wardrobe got a lot of coverage on this trip as it often does a and Mrs Trump weighed in on that she said she wishes people would quit talking about her closed at least [laughter]\nPeople would quit talking about her close as we saw on what I Do not flooded but keeping it it's almost like she wants to talk about what she's where I Am in\nThe ... the ... film and I think was something that was just an oversight in terms of what she was wearing that it wasn't going to be a describe what she wasn't she wore a very sort of out of Africa I kept calling it ask outfit on safari in Kenya\nAnd included for the safari portion a white pets helmet which for Africans\nBrings up a time in their history that isn't necessarily um something that they like to recall a nine to country ... ... outside forces yeah exactly so we try to look at these non verbal cues we try to look into what she's wearing what she's saying\nWhat she's tweeting as she wearing a white suit to the state of the union because she's sending a message about suffragette probably not but we have to examine all those things with this very Private First lady\nYou or if I'm not mistaken the only reporter covering the east wing the first lady fulltime how do you think about that and what is the news value in reporting on the first lady\nYou know people say well what do you do you cover the first lady she doesn't do anything and that's sort of an interesting argument um she does she does it with a smaller staff with a smaller footprint I'm with not necessarily traditional agendas that other first ladies have had\nFor me it's been really interesting trying to crack the code of this woman who\nIronically Maureen Dowd called the Slovenian thanks very we're in front of the things look at the things\nI'm Still in that way it is very interesting and I think that we we can't I Can't report what is she thinking but at

we're going to go into ESPN Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they had signed just one clear and been quarter\nAnd yoga broker after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball\nBasketball's always had these these elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so that's ... that's a big part of the appeal\nWhat's happening in with the players are today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how much do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is ... even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer\nYeah um you know I did a lot of research last year like you had about sixty percent of the week wearing their shoes loss while okay step in and combat that is pretty tough to find okay [laughter] yeah they do have they\nDo have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed six of the talk Fifteen draft picks this year along with an all star in the end or his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like ... like you said the markets already pretty saturated isn't it\nAnd the gamble is this for a company like ... like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out there so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media if you've gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have said could see that in mid may kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is the more important in some ways how these players ... on social media when it comes to promoting issue banned in what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching lots and lots of folks who are a game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on his ... things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys

Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that\nThe Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl world has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse like the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWell colonel worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though isn't acknowledgement by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty of is managerial mistakes not covered\nThe only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop we're all played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations view you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them well and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence credit stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nCourse but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who were abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if\nAfter the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your offices report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes reviving the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nWere you hit the nail on the head so much of this is about\nAn institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution\nIn the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful\nInstitutions accountable and I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is\nIs you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania\nJosh disappear out is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you\nSome of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed a federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers

they ... they said no\nBeats tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry ...\nIs relevant historians it's relevant to the infringement ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public record urgency because\nInstance to getting the road map on to the public record\nUrgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign
