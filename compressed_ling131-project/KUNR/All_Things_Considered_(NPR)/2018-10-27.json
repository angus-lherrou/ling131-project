Washington\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro hosting today from Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor the national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent that's a huge turn around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash\nA decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy we wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their have through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant\nSo we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nIt's emotional yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here and yeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed Don Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary and you know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody like losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and step son the has the each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nA buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here too yeah very elevated you rise a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often\nAround the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry the days are over them good old days are over\n... between the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nI'm not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people and all these great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace\nPolicies that eighty so you're good\nToday Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes\nLittle bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nThey after she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the health care field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant close did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent used\nI at that point was used to being independent\nUsed to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about her work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\nI'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gives me kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Peyton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all those you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but that was not the case\nBut that was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\nThrows out running [laughter]\nThose are fireworks going off overhead at wired nights hair haunted thrilled Peyton runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off a snack all to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself it seems like a fantasy world or something in an area the current owners invited us to take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gate since that\nDay [noise] drove him six hurting freeway Lou entering\nOur tour guide is Jeff ... he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility the site formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars Don Skidmore seems shaken revisiting has passed\nI don't know if you remember this this little circle Dr ... office buildings right there so we\nWe left that are like that\nWe left that\nWe liked the trees like the leaves on the street it's kinda cool kind of eerie and whoa [laughter]\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant it's now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to lead union members picketing traffic jams fog in our in\nOur [laughter] now

Honduran Caribbean has reportedly dropped by half from some seven thousand thirty five hundred now and expected to fall even more the farther north of gifts but that hasn't stopped all the overheated talk coming out of Washington\nLet me just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... column and homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which if people forced their way across the border they could be shot at\nWe do not have any intention right now to people and they will be apprehended however a ... officer an ancient cat at their own personal safety extraordinarily seriously they didn't have the ability of course to defend themselves\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out at the U.S Mexico border\nSo today I spoke with the mayor of Columbus New Mexico a Sikh you'll cello cities right on the border across from Columbus Mexico he said an armed militia from Florida is already camped out west of town patrolling private range land he got a call from another militia\nWest of town patrolling private ranch land he got a call from another militia leaders from South Carolina earlier in the week he said quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me know and will be there the militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol ...\nWe've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and the caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet or tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nThere has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number sort of more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling that\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped them are overwhelmed immigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go critics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis\nThe government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse [noise]\nPresident Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details about\nThat right the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal and international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he attempted with the travel ban and then he'll give his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to
