or charging for faster loading the law basically restores the net neutrality rules created under the Obama administration and repealed under President Trump\nThese are seen as the strongest net neutrality protections in the country and within hours the Justice Department sued\nNeutrality protections in the country and within hours the Justice Department sued to block the California law NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to walk us through what this means for Internet users like us Hayley not high remind us what neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going online\nRight the over arching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet providers should have over your Internet experience\nSo typically when people talk about and neutrality they mean regulations like\nNo blocking of whatever what say you went to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an app\nThat you're visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which is a deal with rising might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your or a data restrictions but then count Netflix toward data just restrictions and these are all rules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repealed neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now the California has gone through what has the reaction but\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive\nLiberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nUm the the writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially the smaller ones like at sea or a video streaming video saying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies\nOn the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your rise in your Comcast that have been pushing California to not putting it\nAnd you're Comcast that have been pushing California to not put neutrality rules into place and are expected to sue California as well\nAnd the Justice Department has already sued California explain why they're doing\nOn so many things actually so it's on a political level California is an interesting state it is the largest economy in the United states\nUm it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies\nIncluding immigration emission standards and often when California sets a standard many companies look around and and think to themselves that it is a lot easier to just abide by the California standard and sort of how goes California so goes the rest of the nation\nFrom

do the market but we are seeing an increase\nMore importantly perhaps the agreement is designed to prevent Canadian dairy farmers from dumping surplus skim milk powder on the world market at what the

house\nThe latest book by Michael Lewis looks lower down the food chain parts of the government that don't get as much attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and nice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll\nAnd and briefing books were not open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up well the real\nPattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at a place like the department of energy but you write about so the department\nOf energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election noon shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThe Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leave\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then a little while later an odd assortment of young people who are ...\nAn odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside the apartment but they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nA ... from ... didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department commerce there's the national weather service the national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and\nIt saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts the person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path of dangerous weather\nSo it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investments in alternative\nYou want to do things like eliminate investments in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term cost of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in his administration and the way is running the government that it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term\nAnd I think the deal to do with their conscious is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\n[noise] or these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit or\nSo and those are people who made a career out of ... people who really know really know\nThe jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump's still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government\nSo there's been a grain of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't\nYears I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that note well\nFirst let's explain why mistakenly wanted airborne going ah her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined this ... active destruction would come and kind of ease or pain she wouldn't have to stare at the bar in any longer\nAnd which he doesn't imagine is that with the same tornado that's going to come take her board is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was the kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine are held their imaginations worker how the human imagination works\n... imagines the destruction it wants it imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the collateral damage he doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I think this failure of the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael
