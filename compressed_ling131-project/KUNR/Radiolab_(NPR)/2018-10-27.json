I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and today we have a legal case well it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal case\nIt's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away it it gets under your skin and this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nHappy Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she said that I'm not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna feral who brought us the story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSure Jim Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post ... he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty\nThey made up of makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to the campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on a sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nSunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again I'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods took them into the woods near a brook\nIn pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had each them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people tied he went back\nTo the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip dumb blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear\nClearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happening to him\nWhat was happening with the man is ... buck knife\nYou step inside times and the cats\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol and melon asking ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next to\nKind of monitor the situation I guess so Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter then our men come men that the other two Cantor's the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted done a killer and Freeman laying down in the ditch and when they did Freeman\nBought a done a killer and Freeman laying down in the ditch and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly and Cooley walked into the forest and us began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see\nWhen the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in the state police standing by our there was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a ... patrols men\nArmed with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods they eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate when it comes back with an ID A\nThirty seven year old Robert De Niro Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape temp seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice\nAnd the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday how do you feel at night when the people got panic when you're all well one of the doors are short of our people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't hear that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left\nBarbecue smoldering they left behind coolers says the manhunt dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police following the lead and that he had stolen car and he had been citing\nThe police follower lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted Guerra\nThese a freeze or drop your gun something to that effect and Guerra started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm and the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but\nThat you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with them they're really in the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing\nBut you wouldn't talk\nAnd it's at this point that the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this is a law professor Liesl arm and again he's\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording so the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank Armani Frank H army and Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or\nYou never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban [laughter] that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use our money but it is our money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon I learned I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York this our money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank our money and I was the attorney for Robert\nGirl um where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well\nWe're just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go forwards I'd like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defendants you're fighting the state and tear it\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert\nDe Niro yeah life you're strong to take him out you need a forty five and a or juice had that feeling the this guy is dangerous and love of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things wind won\nA schoolteacher headless self to his child he was sued the school and I talk to them a little bit\nTo the school and I talk to them a little bit and then he had an automobile accident I represent them um that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then\nWe kept picture for [noise] um molesting some younger kids\nTwo very young girls it's ten eleven Darrell was released on bail he skipped this court date and just disappeared and then we pick up where we left off the murder the manhunt and an August ninth the night Guerra got captured Frank gets a call from\nThere about thirty minutes don't you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up the back door [noise] took of driving that lady friends car to try to lose any too\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nMay be as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren ... and the town's supervisor of Mariah Tom ... says it's a road that goes to the mine is or what is your after the minds it was then sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just a very icy that day this hair is used to be an old roadway [noise]\nWe're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly deep there were no leaves and all the trees were black and I'm Sorry skeletal walking right and they use\nAnd I'm very skeletal walking right in the same area that Armenian that's just the only way they came in here so\nHere we are in our Sunday suits and here we go tragedy choose for is looking for the case\n[noise]\nBut none of them were just looking around [noise]\nAnd then [noise]\nWe found this when her ... well\nYou see the air shaft there they find this air shaft which it was just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the ... the my coffee carefully let's get any such thing yeah you don't want to fly down there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank Armani lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight did he takes out\nAnd then don't see how my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the blue shoe a blue\nSneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this son of a bitch does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of your boom me back up\n\n\nEventually algae found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery workout had said he left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder so what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you can't\nYou just can't we took her to know to keep the confidence is over ... under the current rules\nWhich have developed quite a bit since the time this happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or a substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that has yet that can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up and even if they have hired\nDetectives and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if the people are already dead than you who the law is ... that's right\nThan you who the law is ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if maybe you have yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for the client\nThe lawyer is the agent of his client only only the agent of land or also citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a\nThere's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a ... year building on on the side of tell just tell tell\nOf course a soon and I knew Mr hawk from bowling [noise] 'cause his ... daughter were in the same class and I knew him from church and\nOne or if you have to be amenable to feel\nThe anguish of the parents of the family and yet you you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\nBetween the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now what is coming up that hard but it's even harder\n[noise] we'll be right back [noise] [noise]\n[noise] Hi this is already from Arlington, Texas

I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing\nBut it was a client was very guilty of something they'd found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what what's their next move well\nSo they decided to put the burden plea bargain that take this information to the prosecutor and say I have information that will help you solve some cases some case yes\nAnd in exchange I Want you to give me a better deal for my clients to get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give the moon and you're going to take a little well\nThat's kinda gross oh yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's a way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client\nSo report Jim Tracy again they called a meeting with Henry McCabe investigator from the state police the duct tape and the district attorney\nCalled a meeting with Henry McCabe investigator from the state police detective McCabe and the district attorney armies office and when they met army ... search the briefcase was up to be a an investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nBecause they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug and then a Belgian presents the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies\nI Want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off the president and the prosecutor apparently very quickly put two and two together and immediately thought\nAt least they told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven as for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go was here are just was a lawyer to do this job [noise]\nUh I mean I was a good lawyer ...\nThrough art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what a people thing what if what if what if\nYou think so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to it they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n\nSo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of\nPhone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she initially didn't want to go\nOn the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record okay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm a mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money in Belgium founded\n... and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools were teaching and and if you had any dealings with also about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou were the only in talking to you that I Know that it may be they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes in only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing\nWe flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh when we were there sitting with the police men they received a policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call at the unease my daughter's boyfriend\nWhat his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really had any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just\nNever really had any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nAnd in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli\nThe lawyer maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of\nOf horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway just to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approached though says it's with a lot\nOf sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain the I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk\nTo you to kind of um let you have a chance to communicate some of that experience yeah well it's impossible to\nReally communicate and words\nI mean forty years later I'm Still I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\n\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of um substance\nWe've been talking a lot of um substance I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know that you're going to share I don't know you don't have to but\nWell\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree past she must when we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where we're too difficult for us\nAnd [noise] and Danny what's her boyfriend had best jets that summer\nAnd he had a full scholarship to harbor any uh graduated just before and so to live and I'm sure the other two children had great future I had a true and\nIt's just a horrible tragedy\n\nSo horrible you know to be in the position\nTo live [noise] I mean how do you release whose daughter you know would would excuses for you to protecting the person to kill her new justification you couldn't just apply in my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it but it's a way it is\n\nUm and then you get just a minute of silence I tear if that's OK\n\n\n\nEchoes of dogs coming out new things tend to travel up the hill kind of bouncing around a water I think it's some deeper down in their ... thing I Can't tell which tripping everything up here it's frozen solid sure what that is um I think I'm going to turn background\nWhich had put some flowers or something", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab
