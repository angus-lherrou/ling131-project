I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today too\n[noise] [noise] they're gonna start\nThis show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before and say something\nHigh [laughter] than [laughter] okay I think it's a good thing\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started again what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when I became a national\nStory [noise] there was a lot of ... and the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what would we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire me arrived hasten Harris than double John or animals become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police for an itself in\nThe police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way up by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers are the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you\nTwo thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement\nBut I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that's right so Ben and his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBirth birth study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records laws and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... and sat down and started emailing\nEvery single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails\nAsking for five years or so is paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now for\nThis involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved is is a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThings that have been put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of Bush of that\nA while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here\nTo check it out yeah how many how many accidents you think you have sitting on the stuff probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me sit six feet tall we got him broken down by county but you can see uh [noise] so a or B\nUh [noise] so a or B county ... in Boynton Beach uh all the way through the\nAlphabet and you basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk by\nThe combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represents\nA eight hundred and thirty one\nShootings I Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect was or chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and\nUm [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons and some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there are lots of link to it from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations in other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency to keep track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest and sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after you\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers of states that he about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most basic level\nAre are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds any time of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cop\nWhich is where somebody who's usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThe news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the number say about race I think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that\nA forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is\nScent of people shot by police are black and that is a dead as out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nAnd your what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for their same demographics and as we've that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve\nSome form of resisting arrest you know and we talked with in the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very far and present six kind of ... he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were in why we want to start this methane gas bill just moved by the single case is the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know I mean they're all written in this uh employment investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler receive a call on this is the Cato as Daryl police speak Fowler approached department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife and apartment to five five but every one of these things every report is at least one human life someone was either you know\nHuman life someone was either you know [noise] more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nUh so we have on this table that the investigation of death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one people\n\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nMatt guilty and then traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one of those stories\nAnd if you're interested after this episode you can head to our website radiolab dot org and you can hear part two of the series where we follow a totally different story than the one we're going to tell you about today but I'm not I guess a will just turn it over to you now you're okay a ... day one yeah where was this place in\nSylvie by and I wouldn't be doing anything\nDo after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of the mom they'll gotten their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nLike you guys do this after every every event or no for no just wanted it on a trip to no good ones and has been telling everyone about them\n... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nSo no we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping remind you right we all just simply trying to find our way\nTheir personal gathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the largest age at certain point because it was talking to these two women and she just had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew will go through my house she says his age comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over the crystal\n[noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them or their own stories these stories of grief of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun [noise]\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together [noise]\nTo be some earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over it and how we see each other head on the couch you know um air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over\nAnd the rest of the policy for up talking you know getting to know each other you know some sort of shows resource like therapy for\nLet me pass but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe we're at a sex Marlin problems to\nWin crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either\nTwelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass\nSo we usually the video that frequently just saying now that that's\nMom's house probably over like right now and then the police caught attain behind them was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we call execution a vegetable garden 'cause the guard and once the\nGoing and all that but I I Am then 'cause ah when they when they you know when they took him away in released into down the type of stuff we came back here is all you can smell what's going on\nAnd so now like when you got any like it's it's not it's it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm cleaning onions and you get that smell like it just you get those flat ... in\nYour country and it brings you right back here mhm yep\nAnd the toy was just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\nSometimes ... some of the other one that started to cry\n[noise]\nAnd then you don't want me to uh take some yeah my ... a lot a little bit of fun to me a couple of women had to be their phone my\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face a three to one\nAnd then let me\nThree two one\nLet me all started walking back up to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing with us but I Know [noise]\nTo say yeah I Know yeah we haven't been I have a law\nIt was also the great science we've run out once a week\nAnd I three o'clock in the morning [noise]\nRemember the and I used to tell you I saw how do you live so far away from\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nYeah my son was about Fifteen minutes that every time I visit\nHome I have to go there all the time of course\nYeah that would force how could you not\nKnow what you do you want to go take a chair\nSit there yeah\nAnd he's crazy because like it\nIs it fair yeah\nAnd he's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know about yeah like a certain time every\nDay and it's been a little white man we share everything like that but he literally I think he does he like going to have lunch with every day\nBy day and it would be lovely if it's a way I like going on and all of that and it's a little what got us all wasted not do\nYou think he's chair of the home\nNever go but um [noise]\nSo the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise] are you\nAre to me to reveal who was the mother Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown smother Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter was loaded into the ground\nIt was around the time that a few of these women started called themselves the mothers [noise]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC\n\n\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time [noise]\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and put it down a cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between them\nAnd if you're going to get so stay with us [noise]\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing

built this for three to four o'clock an hour of economics an innovation for Planet Money big government cheese is the topic\nThey may not it's not a smart I Do have a nice coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot a warning sign your best shot you want to die I Want you want to die you can die\nHe tells you what was there was um Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police bullets can kill\nTheir fan of our counseling on T.\nV. to pick them up walk them over to the squad car with a man and then he went home\nAnd said this is the thing that you guys will use this video for what exactly is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we hit home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans unicorn tried to stab one I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard that hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest in communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual\nThat they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek\nIsn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of a poor that made the officer think of how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finish watching a video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\n... through the neighborhood if you want to miss it on the front steps waves of hatred would either women that Derrick does stupid son of a bitch you and how close came to be in that they shouldn't be backwards medication wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now\nNow again are almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\n... primary election among the winter they told her they just released his now listen county sheriff like she would was elected the sheriff of Linn county\n[noise] I Am\nIs the county that the tone of each belongs to them and the other thing to mention is that a chip on his organization called her which decrease executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition and police chiefs and twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is\nFor us and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life [noise]\nAnd just a month after ... put out those principles to the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police\nAnd the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against these guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job in somebody's principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have a have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and I sort of thought the same way too but\n[noise] there was this experience than I had registered realized\nHow far [noise]\nHope has to go [noise]\nThat's coming up
