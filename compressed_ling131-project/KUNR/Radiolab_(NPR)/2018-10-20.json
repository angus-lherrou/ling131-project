{"month": "10", "state": "NV", "station": "KUNR", "content": "[noise]\nIt's two o'clock or ... you\nListening to radio lab [noise] radio from W. N. Y.\nAmjad I've I'm Ron I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about\nI'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't see that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping so we must what we've done is is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with a you may want to make one on it yeah anyway the story comes\nTo us from producers Simon at her so let's start can we start in two thousand eight sure about what the song yes please [noise]\n\n\nSo ah December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nFacebook\nWas a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies that right there\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie newer\nWhat are you calling in\nNursing has been like breastfeeding the intent was really just\nAnd has been like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want and Facebook to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\n\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook and one of the opening shot Facebook triggered hordes knows what would become a loud but to face with rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches but but rather something that I think is a deeper than both of them free speech [noise]\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't say that again by just like ... to ... when we\nCan see and what we can see it led Mueller right kids in front of\nMe on the Internet [noise]\n\nThank you Mr Cameron and Mr soccer America got to\nYou subjectively prioritize or sensors speech\nWhat congresswoman or we don't think I'm overdoing of censoring speech\nBut there are types of what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of I can say on Facebook that digital document it's about fifty pages if you print it off\nAnd diet in bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow which made me wonder like\nWhat are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started at all\n[noise]\nCome in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just\nSo I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when one of whom was actually in that room at that moment and now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did\nAnd now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind\nThis was in the early to thousands seismic change in the week and the Internet hierarchy and this was like the deep dark path and ice space time is now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of\nTen million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each\nOf them in front of their own computer and things that come up onto their ... to Facebook\nAnd on Lake meaning like I use or saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this is Kate clinics she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing\nAnd and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content\nAlong with an alert would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen most of what you were seeing was either\nNaked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason why someone had reported\nBecause it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would\nEvery time something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at the computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do at this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards at the at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are a one page long and basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad taken down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breastfeeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until [laughter]\nRise a fight for the rights that Brett\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but\nAccording to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group\nWho had organized ironically enough through Facebook so to coincide with alive protest it just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding\nTo an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a pain and it caught on social networking website is under fire for any pollinate on photos of women brand new meeting their children in twelve thousand members participated and the media request started pouring in the face of God\nSent by sitting in that I didn't hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington Post\nSo the Internet is a trusting of Dr phil it was a media storm and eventually\nPerhaps as a result of our group in our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules so\nFor example by then nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just say no nudity and so the site integrity team that those twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nPrecisely all of these people at Facebook were in charge of trying to define unity\n[noise] well I thought I'm going\nAre generally we\nFound out pretty quickly ... none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nUm so there's a lot of reading for me happening\nA lot about the good work at ... at a certain convey for now I don't I search by these you know sorry she worked in\nI mean like we just came out of there [noise]\nI Know your life in fact\nI Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like in India that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to walk the do you want to be named or do you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's the only find you know I just kind of land victory I don't want them\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAct flew about ...\nWon several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYou know I I signed up to monitor graphic images just given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you guys are so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his head phones [laughter]\nIgnored ...\nCase by case by case by case forty five I Will test every day which just image and efficient and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day oh\nWell ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just like they all got ... um it's too dangerous to X. rated or\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nThat we had to explain to you know people will be squashed by attached to you know people in cages ... like\n[noise] a Thirteen year old girl I'm having sex with an eight year old boy and it's not just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you do that is\nAbsolutely absolutely ... percent um it can be up at night uh\nCatching some thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax he had to start avoiding things\nThat they were there were specific like I said I couldn't watch it was like okay so ... ... S C I was like okay and then I had to wear exploding like nope nope I have to walk away\nAnd I just I had to I I it's just it's too real [noise] I I saw that I it's it's classic adjusted\nThe different moderator I spoke to describe it as being the worst side of humanity you see\nAll of this stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they're going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well ... and ... and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorist propaganda\nOr they're getting harder made that they got the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks\nThrough computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of of the terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda that they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a\nMoving on to our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on\nAnd that surrounding hate speech oh good more or less that's coming out of there will be laughter really there will be comedians there will be jokes and readers\nHey All right okay oh there was so we take a break and come right back I think we should [noise] Hi\nThis is Denise calling

like that\nEventually took to spit on stage even wrote from San\nJose oh why\nDive and my dad\nMy dad [laughter]\nAnyhow so about a year into this running bit a Marshall logs on to Facebook but a ... instead of seeing her normal loose feed a there was this message that pops up\nIt says you posted something that discriminated along the lines of race gender or ethnicity group\nAnd so we removed that post and so I'm like what can I possibly opposed it I really I thought it was like a glitch but\nThen she quit to continue in their highlighted was violating post it was a photo of hers what what is the picture can you describe it\nThe phone with me as what can only be described as the cherub cute little seven year old with big curly hair and she's wearing this blue floral dress her teeth are all messed up in\nInto the photo Marcia had edited in a speech bubble\nThat just says kill all men and so it's\nFunny you know because I had I had a it's funny you know it's just me\nSo it's funny you know 'cause I had I had a it's funny you know it's just me\nWhatever so um I posted\nAgain immediately after like yeah and it got removed again and this time there were consequences I got banned for three days after that then\nAfter several other bands shoot forward this was months later a friend of hers had posted an article in underneath it in the comments section there were guys posting just really nasty stuff\nSo I commented underneath those comments men are Scott which was very quickly removed\nWhen how how long did you get banned for this time thirty days wow yeah\nWas dumbfounded\nAnd so much recalled on her quote militia of with exactly to find out like is this just the female comedians who were sort of like mad\nStarted experimenting posting men are scum to see how quickly I Would get removed and if it would be removed every time and it was\nBut uh when we come back those rules they get toppled so\nThis is Danny from Denver, Colorado radiolab is supported in part by the

X. five new I remember snippets of the day\nFacebook employees were clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news bring\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage shelling new images just release of the Boston bombings I remember seeing the photo published online and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly voters going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this images reading like wildfire across their platform is it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to their rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however half the ... says\nNo the other people are saying this is newsworthy essentially this photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediate\nBend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received\nPush back well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and\nThere are no exceptions there is either or their mistakes were improvements we made the guidelines for moments like this do edge of the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking a down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy how how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff that in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWord starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive ... sent down in order\nWe were essentially told make the exception\nHuh\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this doubt\nYes oh yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook is just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\n... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like Facebook a sort of collective scrap book\nFree speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrap\nBook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you\nWant or yeah it is it now a news organization strength parents\nThey let me let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get the one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a a\nView us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you're responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamentally at at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically sucker burg and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the well Facebook currently sits\nOn this little idyllic legal island where are\nThey can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to fewer regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what ... what really strikes me about all of this is it's here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both\nBeen crafting a set of rules that are both as objective as possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound than what people find interesting more important what what people find newsworthy ... he'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this\nOr that having just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera\nAnd then a man with his face covered grabs her head pulled her head back and slices her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times like just reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like\nOne person who came across this video or at least dozens of others like it was Shannon young\nMy name is Shannon
