[noise]\nOkay so he reads the bone files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years he publishes for [noise]\nIt becomes very popular in the publisher decided to have it translates into a number of languages\nThe publisher decided to have it translates into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it put me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that home popped into his mind and I said\nThere is a challenge what is that what is the challenge okay what I meant was to say well here's the thing he says he got this home mommy none of the new loopholes\nAnd if you just focus on the word that basically it's just that the guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like prison ... piece of ... to open your doors get out into the world ... owns ... get out of bed\nEat some jam goofy too so you don't look so pale and you lose your plump shape the elderly or you know sort of like get better here's to your good health\n... to ...

I can give them a call in and sign up\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I and I needed it Gregory Gregory Warner oh legally Android I'm\nLike I reached him by Skype he told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home in some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nThat they started like not to put down on together them in the Arctic shipping and that\nThey said you should line up with the government's priority yeah these messages from the government ... it's hard to tell it has been reported that this Ethiopian anti terrorism taskforce will wage social media taxed by getting people to send messages on his behalf ...\nEarly ... when it comes out of the ones that these kinds of music\nAnd where they threatening yeah some of\nThem where you know you sound\nThat seemed to these kinds of music\nAnd were they threatening yeah\nSome of them where you know some being given the doctor I Would be punished duck will be in the wintertime comes and ... my ...\nNewspaper he sounded get shut down after publishing one issue and he was planning for a while to fleet in Nairobi\nSecure my safety\nLeave his wife and kid behind and then maybe return grab them apply for asylum in the United states\nYou know my mother and my older brother ... big ding us Washington\nOkay Washington like a lot of Ethiopians he's actually got some relatives in the in the states did they hear that you asked a question to John Kerry\nYeah yeah yeah yeah I've heard that ... what is your mom say\nShe say please don't do that it's not good it might be you know got to get in you things like that you know and I'm like OK yeah not like that yeah\n\n\n... s all um\nYeah a ball you\nYeah a pony\nSeen as a ...\nMovie\nLast on\nRadiolab will continue minimum\nHello this is talk of started crawling hey this is Gregory Warner than I spoke to read from trucks radiolab supported in part by the after the Sloan Foundation the public understanding of science and technology and the modern world for information that I've flown a WWW cuts alone that orange and yellow lab is produced\nBy WNYC I and our eyes to transcend dot org\nThat'd be that'd be alone that or do you allow WNYC I and our ice cream in dot org ... on her and ... and in radio during that got me thinking about some of these stories by [laughter]\nThis is Josephine on Columbus ohio radiolab is supported by constant contact offering hundreds of customize will email template designed to help small businesses established daily email contact with their customers learn more in constant contact dot com [noise] see\nI live just jumps Beth calling from Seattle, Washington Dulles she knows it radiolab is supported by progressive insurance committed to providing a fishing tools to enable customers ... auto insurance learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that the progressive makes\n\nThis is radio lab\nOn K you in our public radio thanks very spending some of your Saturday with us today I'm a summer there with you this afternoon and evening\nCan you when I get to port from the discovery preventing the chemistry of the cocktail museums premier anyone fundraising event\nYou can explore the science of mythology enjoy delicious local fair shot live untangling auctions and more\nIt's on friday November sixteenth details on line and chemistry of the cocktail dot org [noise]\nDamn ... this is radio lab today [noise] five experiments in translation threats from number three free called ... ... ... ... I just got the ... now you're try\nThis one of Robert Krulwich and our producer someone wheeler talked to a writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin was George Carlin mentioned\nOh because Carlin is a wonderful sort of folk philosopher language you're talking about the comedian meeting yeah [noise]\nIt's like saying is about the English language it's about middle expressions we use we we all stay in the little sayings and expressions that we use all the\nTime oh this is one of his great subject really seemed to examine these expressions and all the more interesting because he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he got from schooling and one of\nGOP next favorite curling nurse and I really like just want to just about how Carlin hated euphemism I don't\nLike words that high the truth I don't like where's the conceal reality I don't like euphemisms and American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality economy was wonderful about things like that was about both as he calls and we I've known\nPeople in this country normal people we shift them all away and we brought in these senior citizen [noise]\nIsn't that a ... he was on some of\nWe use you for his I've just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught we just want your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill\nThat they've been taught we just want your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely I mean she's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs to the hill\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise book Carlin's real point was that it it like does\nOur reactions to it that actually have like a cabin negative fat and it gets worse with every generation and he has a whole bet it's about um shell shock becoming pie TST no he goes no because it's in four different things\nIn the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shots simple ... direct language two syllables shell shocked and then it became battle fatigue\nBattle for the fourth of those now takes a little longer to say doesn't seem to hurt as much and then after it became battle fatigue then it became operational exhaustion [noise]\nHey we're up to eight syllables now then it became post traumatic stress disorder ... we've added a hyphen and then it became peachy as the post traumatic stress disorder that pain is completely buried under jargon\nThis wasn't or will notion that you could erase sensitivities if you blended out the words so if you stop saying oh yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some free choice\nOf interrogation or enhanced interrogation that makes a big difference in part of a curling saying is that like now that his pie TST we are not having the appropriate reaction to it I mean its shell shocked\nNot having the appropriate reaction to it I mean its shell shocked\nI'll bet ya if we'd have still been calling a shell shocked some of those Vietnam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at that time [noise]\nYou know now that she's blind which is walking down the streets of New York city especially of town where the streets are a lot\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her\nI hardly ever notice other people walking around me I feel like I'm just walking\nI can I hear the topic and it's on the topic but not as if people\nBut she says when she puts a device on and put those sensor undertone the sidewalk [noise]\nCame alive I thought it was amazing like I didn't know this many people are on the street at the same time as me and now they're um they're all there again would you describe them in a way that sounded\nAlmost like a painting like\nReally soft watches everything in Salt lake soft Bronx is as you\nCan move\nThere walking and I can see their life with me and I can see them their gate but I couldn't see them clear you know like I can see the features or\nWhether they're wearing a shirt or shorts or address or parents I just like see their shadows\nAnd every now and and I see the light cats\nAnd every now and I see the light cast it I'm not really yeah [noise]\nI had imagined some L like underwater creatures uh-huh squishy jellyfish like [noise] yeah\nYeah I claim yeah [noise]\n\nYeah I think that [noise]\n\n\nIn that friendly is what it's like to translate the city with your tongue New York city becomes is a cheesy sea of walking fish they make their way along in the sunshine\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWe were lucky enough to get a video of Emily

give them the by whom I better he's ... the deadly bugs little ... ... you know you try\nTo you guys mind if in the remaining few minutes we're going on an\nArmy fishing expedition sure sure it's the here's here's the here's our quandary girl okay what's your situation we're doing Sean ... recently we sat down with a reporter and science writer Carl Zimmer to talk about\nOur name ... we're talking about something else in our name came up at the end 'cause heres why ever since we started doing this show Robert got his [laughter]\nHis I got a little insistent little interest in a good year like our innate we got to learn it yes I said that are and I was like what do you want to do and you're like I Want to do or nay and I was like but is there a story and you're like no no I didn't\nSay that I just said that that ... that that if you understood what our innate does you'd realize the translation is profoundly important to our existence that's why I said yeah well as often happens you or\nMe down as like All right fine let's just try it and they'll say you know so we're talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of\nWith Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town not secure your son was getting married yes he was and uh her I was doing like tech team work for me\n[laughter] okay All right so the definition of translation and biology is taking a sequence in DNA and using the genetic code to translate it into proteins ... ... ... and the discovery\nOf this was maybe even more exciting than the discovery of the double helix structure\nReally yeah it was bigger than Watson and Crick yeah well at least equivalent wow so here's a quick story so what happened was\nOkay so just to set the table here we all know the DNA is a thing and that when you're born you get half your DNA from your mom and a half your DNA from your dad and Francis Crick and and er James Watson just figured out the structure of DNA that basically\nThe rest of the of DNA your recipe is comprised of four bases in a long string a T C and gee that's it he's the problems he like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy pain piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from ... yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins and our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that good generated\nLike how did this for simple base has become the acids to become the hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us\nDo you make the transition ... people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved and the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist as cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't the\nThis is cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ...\nThis is a code problem ... thought okay I Know the DNA is ... four bases ATC and GE and ...\nDays somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein so I just need to think\nOf a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you\nPut in the DNA the ACC TGI keeps\nGoing and then out comes the protein\nHow what what simple code could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out two sides I think that ourselves read our genes three bases at a time\nLike instead of a T. C. G. A. C. cannot thought maybe it's a TA C. C. G. P. C. A. A. C. A. G. A. T.\nIn other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triple not care because if you have a sense of three or rather than to game I figured well that'll give mathematically would give you more possibilities and that might put you on a path to making all those hundreds of thousands of\nProteins now this was just a guess but shortly after the double helix duo Watson and Crick and a group of other scientists worked it all out they they've figured out how you get from physically get from DNA into proteins\nHere's how it works sort of inside the cell the DNA is sitting\nThere and [noise] all coiled up [noise] a set of molecules come along attached to it as if it and make a copy of\nThis coffee is now made of ... which is like DNA very similar and still in the base", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "13"}
