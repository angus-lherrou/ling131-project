I Am the director general of the uh World Trade organization\nUh since to any sort of teen and would you describe the director general rule of the WTO as essentially a diplomatic wrote the diplomatic role of the uh\nA director general is the one that he has to perform as a as a builder of bridges he has to approximate positions you have one hundred and sixty four members now a to guide and um and they have very different perspectives\nOf uh uh everything on everything on on politics economics today on freakonomics radio a conversation with the WTO's Roberto as a beta about what makes for a successful negotiation I Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn in kindergarten\nI Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn in kindergarten\nWe talk about whether the global economy is doing as well as the current numbers indicate\nIt's amazing that I Do hear people say oh but the economy is great\nOf course it's great it hasn't been affected here\nIn which came first the president for the terrorists President Trump didn't just happen\nYou know he didn't just fall from those guys\n\nGuess freakonomics radio show that explores the inside of everything [noise] here's your house even that Mary [noise]\nThe world Trade Organization was founded only in Nineteen Ninety five but has its roots in Britain woods conference in Nineteen forty four which also gave rise to the world bank and the international Monetary Fund\nThese institutions were set up to help to resuscitate and grow the coast or global economy\nBut the political timing wasn't right for global trade organization instead an agreement between twenty three countries called the general agreement on tariffs and trade was signed in Nineteen forty seven when the number of signatory countries reached a hundred and twenty three the agreement was formalized and given more teeth\nWith the establishment of the WTO its mission is to quote ensure that trade flows smoothly predictably and freely as possible but in recent\nThe ... and freely as possible but in recent months global trade has become quite a bit less moods and much less predictable with the U.S threatening or enacting massive tariffs against a variety of countries and industries with retaliatory tariffs quickly following\nThat's where we begin the conversation with Roberto as a beta we spoke a few weeks ago I was in New York and as a beta was that WTO headquarters in Geneva [noise]\nSo we are in a particularly noisy\nA trade environment at the moment it's in the headlines all the time considering the threatened an actual terrorists emanating from the U.S a and considering the U.S role in the global economy what share of your time currently\nIs taken with issues that concern directly or indirectly the U. S.\nAre you talking about the largest economy in the world so it's natural that a lot of my time uh we'll have some kind of relationship with a actions taken by the United states also because an accent that it's taken by the United states has repercussions are everywhere\nAre across the world so anything that the U.S does will have a global systemic effect so of course a lot of my time\nHas to do with that but what is important also you have to realize that President Trump didn't just happen\nYou know he didn't just you know fall from the skies you know the ambient that was a a knock ripe and then found a direction that didn't that that was not he is the results of a very real\nA situation in American society an Indian American economy and or if you don't understand the forces\nThe American society and in the American economy and or if you don't understand the forces that put him there I think that's part of getting the wrong diagnosis and I have to do there is a lot of sympathy for some things that are said uh owned a part of the United states\nThat are welcome in other areas of the world but not every single force\nThe WTO is opposed to tariffs generally and most economists agree that terrorists are really distorted way to do trade\nBut it strikes me that there are a lot of instances where tariffs exists under a different name one of the U. S. is the biggest complaints is that China for instance doesn't honor intellectual property that\nRather than being bought or license the properties copied so that would essentially be a tariff on the imported version then their their government subsidized their airline industries or their agricultural industries are oil and gas and sugar\nDo you the WTO have any ability to direct totally request or command that these are terrorists not by name but in essence be eliminated\nHappens all the time industries like protection\nThey want to be supported by the government is they want to get help and they are now seen this um a prize in what we call\nBehind the border protection a and that happens in the form of a technical barriers it happens in the form of a insufficient an enforcement of certain rules like you mentioned intellectual property and that's much more difficult to assess because the Arabs you can measure\nThe Arabs you include only a spreadsheet and you'll prepare for it to pay that additional cost a behind the board there\nYou're a spreadsheet and you'll prepare for it to pay that additional cost a behind the board of their marriage or you don't know when they come you know what form they would take so it's it's stuff we have a committees are hearing the W. job will discuss exactly that\nDo you have any sense if you had to estimate the size of those ... what they would be compared to the official tariff rates\nAnd not really a also because some of those a perfectly legal you would see some countries are a put it in place technical barriers or technical standards that are more demanding than ah what other countries apply and that could be for the protection of the consumer\nOr it could be for preventive measures and those things are difficult to measure\nBut they can be very significant definitely uh in several situations they just stopped trade altogether so that's ah whatever and infinite ... at the border only measured and [noise]\nThe WTO says the average tariff rate among its members fell by Fifteen Percent between the organizations founding in Nineteen Ninety five and two thousand Thirteen [noise]\nThere are however many ... Harris rules are less stringent for developing countries for instance furthermore trade deals negotiated in good faith by one country's administration can be deemed by a leader administration to be unfair or just an palatable\nNAFTA the U.S Canada Mexico free trade treaty was signed a year before the WTO came into existence President Trump was not a fan of NAFTA\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever may [noise]\nI'm curious how that makes you feel as a director general of\nThe WTO do you feel excluded do you try to get involved in those discussions and make sure they fall within the um the proper parameters of WTO behavior\n[laughter] to be Frank with you I don't have to try very hard they reach out for me very quickly sometimes I Try to discourage or some courses of action\nBut I also have to understand the political sensitivities in in many of these uh players we have um I'm happy to say uh conversations which are\nVery open and very Frank and um of course it can share with you and the listeners or the content of those conversations but um\nTo end the listeners or the content of those conversations but are they are very very Frank and ah we explore\nAll kinds of options are before us I tell them about the importance of the system and not to compromise the system and I would say that pretty much everybody I talked to a ... tells me that the system must be preserved even strengthen [noise]\nBut it's not easy under these circumstances to be you know to the line when others are and\nComing up after the break with the head of the WTO on our show of course we're going to ask him to make some predictions about trade and the economy my crystal ball doesn't allow me to go that far\nOh well but don't worry Roberto as of eight has plenty more to say we'll hear it after the break\nFreakonomics radio is supported by target presenting future at heart and new podcast that explores the work of change makers across the country and highlights projects in cities like Miami Washington DC and New York city future at heart available on apple pie cats or wherever podcaster found\nFreakonomics radio is supported by progressive insurance offering snapshot a device designed to reward safe drivers learn or at progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nGood afternoon it's great to have you along Chris Jordan here and we are listening to freakonomics radio right here on K. U. at our\nStick around until one for it's been a minute with Sam Sanders and join host Bob Carol this evening from six to eight as he hosts the music of America [noise] this week on the music of America joined Bob Carol as he celebrates\nThis week on the music of America joined Bob Carol as he celebrates the Seventy fifth anniversary of the Reno ...\nPlus the music of Robert who lay and Julie London that the music of America with Bob Carol tonight from six to eight pm on K U when our [noise]\nWe get support from Les for my del at American wealth management providing sophisticated investment management and customized financial planning securities offered through MS housing company\nMember ... as I ... the information that three three to seven thousand [noise]\n\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nRoberto Acevedo director general of the world Trade Organization was appointed to the post into thousands Thirteen when the trade waters were considerably less choppy than they are today [noise]\nSo you're from Brazil and you've studied electrical engineering before becoming a diplomat I'd like to just very quickly here had those three factors Brazilian engineering\nAnd being a career diplomat how they inform your role as director general of the WTO Brazilian um\nWell the good thing about being a Brazilian is that it gives me a very diverse prospective Brazil has a is a big economy a it's a big country with several ethnicities a very diverse cultural backgrounds\nAnd it has aspects of a a developed nation a very sophisticated industry but also has important aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that\nImportant uh aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that gives me this different perspective engineer\nI was always good with numbers and I think it was natural for me to become an engineer and it was\nUntil I met my wife ah and ah she decided to get into the diplomatic career\nAnd I'm at that point in time I had to decide you know ... what would I Do an engineer married to a diplomatic was going to be pretty challenging especially when she was posted abroad so I thought you know what let's let's\nWork for the family so I took the um\nThe exams and I passed or the exams and I joined the diplomatic career I think that was a lobster in its own rights\nCan you give me a quick example of an engineering like solution to a trade or economic problem\nSo and I'm In a meeting or something like that I Try to understand the basic motivations in and then figure out a way to make 'em those motivations work together\nAnd that's something I think that engineers do to try to get very complex situation some problems [noise] try to reduce them to derail a mental a conservative parts and or figure out a way to make them work\nPersonal chemistry is very important as well even between negotiators are I Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn in kindergarten and I think that's quite accurate but uh I I found out that forever learning how to re ... relate to people how to take into account as diverse personalities cultures objectives\nSo as long as the world still has um independent nations and it seems that will be the case\nStill has um independent nations and it seems that will be the case for at least another few decades that we're not becoming one big global nation it strikes me that there's an inherent friction around trade 'em in which\nEvery country has to strike a balance between protectionism and globalism and so I'm curious whether you agree or disagree with this notion and however you answer what's to be done about that\nDistinction I'm that exists or even today are with regard to trade it always existed countries that do trade and that have ah a cooperative\nRelationship with the other partners they essentially gain from that\nBut it is also a reality that when you trade some sectors in the domestic economy or will lose many gain a mini are better off with a with a trading relationship but that some news in the sense that they're not competitive enough\nSometimes the factories clothes or in particular sector and are you cannot ignore that\nThink what you see today is something different from this very traditional very a historic attention\nToday we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things fester we don't require 'em as much human input as we did before\nAnd this is increasing now clearly even for the government send for politicians it is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies it's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they are\nIt's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they are they have a role of course Madame minor in this structural change and I think if we don't realize that if we don't try to find a solution for this will be hurting much more than the help it\nOkay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully and succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric\nSo it's easy to think of what the wrong medicine how involved is the WTO in trying to discover and administer the right medicine\nI think the number two is already at least trying to help governments and public opinion to understand the situation and reached the right diagnosis if we get the wrong diagnosis who get definitely the wrong medicine the important thing to understand is that whatever medicine we choose it's not going to work overnight\nThere is no quick fix for this this is a this is essentially something akin to the industrial revolution so there will be a need to rethink the whole educational system or in countries\nHow to support the displaced are people are those who lost their jobs but cannot find a job somewhere else in the economy how are you will help them\nFind and other economic activity that will work for them and to help them support their family and the state of course I and I I understand that people don't want this I myself have very strong reservations against a a big state\nBut the state at least his to think about this and think about the mechanisms that will allow a U.S to to handle these are displaced a masters of workers\n[noise] you've said that if you want the truth and trade you have to get into the numbers which at political discussion\nThat if you want the truth and trade you have to get into the numbers which a political discussion almost inevitably doesn't keep talk about that for a moment and maybe give a a particular example where the political discussion on trade is just wrong or shallower only partially true and what needs to be done to address that\nOr yeah probably I didn't realize one of the whole and yes [laughter] there's actually even like thirty more\nBe that one university economist has the ear of so many governments and institutions\nFor a clue let's get back to\nFor a clue let's get back to why months of Cato found such inspiration in Carl Marx\nOne thing that's fascinating about Martin says that he's known as a critic of capitalism but actually when you read capital of Mali one two and three you end up really admiring and appreciating the dynamic aspect of capitalism which is technological change we shouldn't forget that futile ism was five hundred years of inertia\nOne of the defining features of capitalism is in fact the way the innovation has really broken down all sorts of law that is constantly changing how industries operate how production distribution and consumption work and marks really talks about that\nQuite curious that one of the you know most famous critics of capitalism actually described it and the most dynamic\nOf always and that's what got me interested in economics of technological change\nBut it's not just technological change interests much cut out she has a relatively radical stance on the value that's created by technological change\nWhat do I mean by radical stance consider the titles of her books the first was called the entrepreneurial state [noise] those two words entrepreneurial and state typically are not used to gather\nMust have got his latest book is called the value of everything making taking in the global economy when it comes to the relationship between government and economic growth Martha ... who knows how to talk to an artist goes it goes like this\nMy God the government put a basket case group of bureaucrats they don't know what they're doing\nBut she sees it differently you know what would be without a GPS\nPublicly financed what would Google be with\nWhat would ... be without a GPS\nPublicly financed what would Google be without the Internet publicly financed [noise]\n... was born in Rome but grew up in Princeton New Jersey where her father took a job as a research physicist at the university and she studied history and international relations at Tufts and got her PHD in economics\nAt the new school for social research in New York and now she lives with her family in London and in an interview with the Financial Times I'm lunch with the F T um where you go and have lunch and a glass of wine\nOr do you said well they're expensive that's the one I saw that the glass of wine you ordered costs forty pounds\nI made an error they made an error you well I didn't try this is how they treat you know they treat you they trick you I don't know if it's because I was a woman and they didn't show me the price you know to the gentleman or if it's what that does but there is no prices I was so involved in the conversation I just pointed to the first one I saw and it turned out to be the most expensive wine that\nAnyone who read that article that call me a\nSoviet ... social [laughter] right\nSo to someone who says you know free markets are almost always good and governments are almost always bad to someone who says that you say what\nFirst is what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith\nA you know a one of the first economists back in the late Seventeen hundreds he actually meant by the word free market not free from the state but free from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so when I say to those who say that you know\nThose activities that extract value so what I say to those who say that you know we need less state\nI'm uh in order to be more innovative more dynamic I say well let's look at one of the most innovative parts of the U.S economy which is Silicon Valley did that come from the free market or from an active the visible hand or the state\nMy point is actually the state was involved in almost everything a in Silicon valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important ah companies in that area but\nThe role that public actress played was really across the whole innovation chain\nSo you're talking about agencies like dark but NASA and the national institutes of health and so on yes\nExactly I'm Talking about both agencies that do basic research like the national Science Foundation but also a agencies more downstream doing applied research\nLike a DARPA little sister organization in more recent times called art they eat the national institutes of health which continued to spend more than thirty billion dollars a year and the most radical\nUncertain high risk a research\nAnd here's some evidence of the government funding that Mexico is talking about DARPA or the defense advanced research Projects Agency\nCreated during the Cold War to keep American technology ahead of the Soviet\nIs over the years produced several kinds of missiles and airplanes as well as the first computer mouse miniature GPS receivers each de displays and the digital personal assistant ARPA e or the advanced research Projects Agency for energy founded under George W Bush\nSearch Projects Agency for energy found that under George W Bush has funded a variety of energy projects including battery storage tech\nThe department of energy starting in Nineteen Seventy eight invested more than a hundred and thirty million dollars studying the extraction techniques that have come to be known as fracking\nAnd the national institutes of health has helped fund the vast majority of all new drugs approved\nBy the FDA\nThese public institutions have absolutely co created value is quite extraordinary that we've become very used to these kind of much more passive words to describe the state you start having to change the ...\nAh that one uses so instead of saying the public sector deem risks the private sector is actually about sharing risks instead of talking about just facilitating and enabling business it's really about taking on the lead investor role as an investor first resort\nOne of the central arguments you make is that government institutions and closet government institutions are involved in the investment are involved in the risk and yet you argue barely share in the return how big of a problem is that\nIt's a huge problem and it comes back probably talk about things I often remind people I'm In Plato [laughter] a sad story tellers ruled the world so these stories that we tell\nAbout who creates value has in fact created the stories that are that justify the extraction of of value so let me give you an example which I think brings home\nThe U.S government after the crisis decided to have a proper fiscal stimulus program of close to eight hundred billion dollars\nThe school stimulus program of close to eight hundred billion dollars and\nPart of that agenda was really also to direct that says go stimulus towards the green economy so you might remember that Obama finance some companies like a cylinder through the U.S department of energy through a guaranteed loans that was for about five hundred million and that company went bust\nTheir new questions about a cornerstone of stimulus won five hundred and thirty five million dollar loan to a company called cylinder and make solar energy panels\nWhy does the taxpayers have to be the one footing the bill to try to shift some power solar power works people said my God the\nGovernment would a basket case group of bureaucrats they don't know what they're doing they shouldn't be picking winners they should just really do this kind of facilitating rolls of you know construct some roads education infrastructure and then get out of the way on\nWhich first of all completely misses the point that actually the U.S government in terms of energy has been the lead finance or\nOf areas like solar and wind alongside other governments but also nuclear fracking itself came out of a\nA U.S government financing early on but more concretely at the same time that it was financing cylinder and also finance Tesla for a very similar amount of money so that Tesla esque car got a four hundred and sixty five million guaranteed loan\nAnd when I say guaranteed I'm Talking about guaranteed by the U.S taxpayer so when cylinder Owen by the taxpayers we're pretty angry that they had to pick up the bill but why did the taxpayers not know that they had also finance Tesla would not have changed the narrative and the perception\nWould it not have changed the narrative in the perception of what the bureaucrats in Washington were doing they actually had a portfolio like any venture capitalists which you know takes on risk and so\nTo speak to any a venture capitalist they will tell you that for every success there's many failures however if you really want to be a venture capitalist you have to construct your portfolio in such a way that you also get some of the upside from the winds precisely to cover that downside\nAnd the u._s. government didn't do that so not only how they failed on the marketing side they had it actually communicated to us citizens of all the successful us investments which include everything on your iPhone or smartphone from the Internet GPS touch screen display series all government finance\nBut in this particular case people didn't know that Iran must come sell had received you know financing protests law anyone must by the way has received a total of five billion dollars a billion let's nine zero\nFive billion dollars has been spread across must three companies test for space X and solar city Martha ... says it taxpayers should be getting a much better return for investments like\nWhat the US government actually did with tests that was the opposite of what they should do they said thinking they were quite a wise if you fail to pay back the loan we get three million shares in your company\nYou have to ask yourself you know why all these Goldman Sachs guys who were in fact that Obama's government didn't actually come through and they were needed because they should've said the opposite if you do pay back alone we get three million shares", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "year": "2018", "city":
