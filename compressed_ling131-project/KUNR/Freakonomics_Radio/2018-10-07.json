freakonomics radio the third installment in the series we're calling the hidden side of sports in the first episode we looked at how sports have always mirrored society from our historical penchant for war colonizing two or more recent obsession with pushing the limits of human achievement\nIn episode two we looked at the economics of a single NFL franchise San Francisco forty niners and how they have begun to recover from a debilitating losing streak\nI mean when you lose a game a lot it always happens when you lose to a ton happens usually trees like Armageddon [noise] I'm trying not\nIn today's episode becoming an athlete\nTime to step back and try to understand how\nThe time to step back and try to understand how these people rose to such heightened scientific is the process how predictable\nWill look at a number of factors including of course raw talent my parents are both superstar athletes will look at will determination I did a bunch of push ups and sit ups that night until I was I'm throwing up\nAnd the mental aspect of this most physical pursuits well I think the mind is is a big of a separate or um for professional athletes as any physical tools\nWill hear stories of opportunities gained and lost in Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent and we'll hear one story and it's almost too good to be ...\nThey said hey you are blowing up on Twitter you bought a voyage Graham you know your everywhere and you just have no idea\n\nIs freakonomics radio to show that explores the inside of every ... here's your house even [noise]\nWhen you see an elite performer in any field sports store music or surgery whatever it's natural to ask yourself the question how they get sick\nAnd it's natural to ask yourself the question how they get so that how much of that ability where they born how much is attributable to hard work can practice this is a debate that's been going on probably forever nature versus nurture raw talent versus what's called deliberate practice\nWe've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become a great at just about anything\nToo often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious that the ... great at anything you need both talent in practice lots of each but\nEven that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because athletic success like any success and leave Bernie failure it's what you might call multi factorial\n[noise] a lot of input from a lot of variables imagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels in identical training methods\nYou really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also ended up identical as much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe real life is more nuanced than that also interesting so I mean [noise]\nJay Z\nSold drugs [noise] grow up in a Marcy projects to a single mother\nThat's Dominique Fox worth who played six seasons and the NFL\nNow he is a multi multi millionaire married to be on say the most amazing talent we have today so why don't we set it up so that all young men must sell drugs\nSet it up so that all\nYoung men must sell drugs when their kids and um and have only their mother and grow up in a Marcy projects in Brooklyn New York I mean\nHe had a great talent and to be honest like there's probably a a great deal of luck like\nHe happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in snitch on them like that is like a lot of luck\nAnd that to me see and I think the same thing is true for me like I can go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happened that were just happenstance that led me to these positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that\nShould be that should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems crazy\nSo okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with physical ability it may not surprise you to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age\n... to share a for instance a three time major league baseball all star yes you know ... and\nMost kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athlete you're going to be the best get on your team\nPlayed every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always while yes ah and I actually enjoy playing basketball more uh I play backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of ...\nYou know a sport for my future athletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child in super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve limit we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son\nThat boy is about a hundred times more likely than a random boy also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals and be trouble\nOh man well my ... my life has literally been family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both superstar the athletes they both come from very athletic families\nMy parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is shifting who's won two Olympic gold medals\nMy mom is extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgery than hands surgeries and neck surgeries and everything but she's still such an incredible athlete\nWell I mean my dad kind of did every sport when he was growing up\nAnd the gold medal gymnasts Shawn Johnson\nHe was a hockey player he wrestled he did BMX he a race NATO acts I mean everything\nJust how powerful is the sports gene David Epstein is a science journalist and author of a book called the sports gene in it he tells the story of a man named Donald Thomas Donald or is about six\nTo I'm leaving a ... guy\nThomas played basketball at small college in Missouri but he was far from an elite player and the ...\nA small college in Missouri but he was far from an elite player in the college program was far from ... one day in the gym he was bragging about how high you could jump\nAnd the best jumper on the track team a guy named Carlos overheard him and said you know you're talking all that trash um you wouldn't even clear bar a six foot six and a real competition and Donald says yes yes I Would\nAbout point four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I can't say I've thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on to something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think is you want your kid to be a fence or\nThe guy that you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave a fencing the the only exception being my own university University of Chicago and each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill there's three different blades says eBay there's Sabre and the soil and there's male female fancy and\nGiven that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers so it's something like six or seven percent of the kids you ever tried to be sensors ended up being college fences I'm not saying they get scholarships but that ...\nEnd up being college ... about seeing they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit thing fencing increases your chances from that point four percent base find\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else constant something like Fifteen fold\nWe should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would soon to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admission sweetener how does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nMy God if you want to go to an Ivy League school\nForget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like three hundred thousand kids playing high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be taught soccer players but that the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing\nTurns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids have you turned in defense or is it\nExactly one and uh so far so good uh I I couldn't say I really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old and he fences at a really good club in Chicago and I don't know his grades aren't that good\nSo she knows when I Know as everyone else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to be because of fencing [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio the story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then when it's time to go\nYou have an athlete who did go to an Ivy League

to go into the production of an elite athlete Palin's drive the right kind of practice may be a parent or to to get you to the ring to the gym or the track five AM and Shawn Johnson told us earlier he might need some luck\nI mean you you can't get hurt you can't have the flu on the wrong day you have to find the right coach Wright city I was incredibly lucky to end up with my coaches\nSo how'd that happen it was kind of freak occurrence\nMy coach was Chinese born and raised Chinese um when he was three years old he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast and he\nKind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him\nHe he lost his childhood he looked kind of lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left the China came to the United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa law\nThe United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian or Olympians that were also children and how to balance in life and were\nYou know fun loving and had a true childhood Johnson had started her training at different gym and I loved it it was awesome but child my coach that took me to um backs opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house\nAnd my parents ended up switching they had to save gas money and I was really really blessed to fall under his his guidance and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have\nVery loving very very protective people around me and he I mean given today's society I can thankfully and\nSay that he he can't be safe and I am from grateful for that\nShawn Johnson is good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunities whether through bad luck\nWar through something much more concrete like lack of money over the past decade youth sports economy has doubled more than Fifteen billion dollars a year\nAnd a lot of youth sports involved some sort of pay to play model\nPay to play something but just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business of itself a less about\nTrue true true development\nBrandon McCarthy and he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons it's attorney\nHe's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons [noise]\nIt's a tournament in California this week as the next week and you go to Nevada after that it's Texas and I don't understand how two working parents could ever afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\n... you know the theme of economics last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near that all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on your team and one player I'm at the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one can only make to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go on those trips and then the coach doesn't favor hem and play them\nI think this that trickle down effect from there and there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment you name it over time it's starting to bear itself out as some income inequality just creates better baseball players and worst baseball players\nOr in one or the instance a huge drop in baseball players\nIn Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent so the question is why the decline\nDavid Canton is a history professor and director of the Africana studies program at Connecticut College\nThe huge drop of black players in baseball he argues has a number of historical causes including the relative rise of black football and basketball players but he puts most of the blame on deeper structural issues\nSo I look at these factors the industrialization mass incarceration and suburbanization so\nMass incarceration as suburbanization so at the industrialization lack of tax base we notice no funds to what construct and maintain ball feels\nSo you see the rapid decline of the physical space in the Bronx in Chicago and these other uh urban areas which leads to a lack of participation\nThe opportunities that again is Dominic Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nAnd then in college I wanted to be a ... computer science major at um University of Maryland and my academic advisor was like Mm though that that core slows gonna make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices their labs and blah blah blah blah so I was like not not going to do that so instead\nYou did was an American studies yeah and that American studies when journalism ... which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while playing\nFootball [laughter] no I um I enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready for football and I\nSay I want to say once I got to the league and I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you have given up through the course of your life\n\nYou shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox or he played long enough to enter free agency his final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now out of football for a few years he still feeling the after effects\nOf his single minded\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid I had a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me close to that goal but give me further away from other important and interesting things including friends and including family and\nAnd then I Will say All right I'm done playing so\nBe in the state of transition\nDone playing so I Will be in the state of transition his\nTransition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players union he's now doing some writing and sports casting I mean I think\nIt's a feeling of loneliness honestly which\nAnd it's not like I have three kids and my wife and I'm not like alone obviously and I love them and I have fun with them and but throughout my life I have been almost ... focused on a goal which\nBeing focused on that goal like gave me purpose and I'm sure I'm going to butcher the nature the quote but it's something to the effect of\nA when a man has a why he can bear almost anyhow and like\nI was I didn't I don't drink now I never drank in my life I never smoke we like I\nWas single focus on doing everything every decision I made with like All right I'm going to get closer to go and I I ... the people I was close with in high school like those are my friends any more people I was close with in college like not really my friends anymore and then at thirty five I'm In DC where my wife has\nA bunch of family and friends friends that she's been close with since they were in the second grade and
