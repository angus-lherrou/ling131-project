Wilson birthday is in June and he turned seven alone in in a shelter\n\nWhen they were finally we're you know Wilson into NATO flew to Fort Smith Arkansas with their family\nKnow out of you were there with the family waiting for them to a rod you sat with them while they talk to us on the phone before his flight what was that look first let me play this for you\n[noise]\nYou get in the way let them\nAnd it sounds like a completely different atmosphere so joyful [noise]\nWhat I found though\nThey way I won't ... sequence all the seats [noise]\n\nSo how is Wilson handled the transition from the shelter back to his family life\nHe finally gets to the house with his family everything is different he he has his own bed he's with his mom ah they sleep in the same room\nIn in this bunk bed and he hears the voices the accent of the people that are familiar to him since his family uh we we walk through his whole garden and he's pointing out the name of every plant every single everything and I'm pretty good with plants and I was\nPlant every single everything and I'm pretty good with plants and I was just blown away this is like the little baby botanist out\nThere I mean he's\nA he's eating the foods he knows his great grandmother mean Thursday as by hand they're sharing a meal together\n[laughter]\nI can just hear it in that in that duty laughter it's just it's it's so pure and I feel like everything that was you know the hard core the tragedy and the trauma we've put a period on that in some ways and and now it almost feels like the next chapter in in his book\nAnd Wilson's actually started his next sugar\nYes he started school I went with him to meet his teacher for the first time and from the minute we we got in the car right we're about to go to the school for the first time he was so excited he was like bouncing off the walls he's yelling phrases in English and she\nWhich is the indigenous language that he picked up from his friends at at the shelter\nA and he's you know playing with my recording kid and I won't play you all of that because it'll hurt your eardrum\nBut he was so excited he he gave him so he got\nYou\nIt was so awesome to to see him there he is he's got a cubby and his new classroom he's got his name on the little desk where he's going to sit next to all of his little friends and you know walking into the classroom just reminded me that we slipping as a first grader he he ...\nIt means that we just living as a first grader he he really is that little\nSays so great this is the story started also hard now you're just making me smile the hotel it's so good to hear\nThat the anthem\nAnthony was happy to never even knew a person but I mean\nShe came to introduce her son that he's going to learn [noise]\nYeah I had better even though the\nAttorney was was hard now now she's happy that plus I'm lord of the [noise]\nIntervene emphasis Saudi I'm On you know there are\nCountless questions that still remain about her immigration case and she doesn't know what's gonna happen there but she does now that her son is finally in school [noise]\nWe have this little thing all\nHow are you will likely to\nI hear my enemy\nWe met his teacher her name is ... and she was really great she's so sweet with him and at one point and she asked him what probably a lot of teachers are asking kids\nSo why did you hear this summer\nAnd I thought I'm just going to talk to her for a little bit and then I'm going to go but when she started telling me her story I it's almost like time slowed down and all I could think about was what she was saying\nWhat Sandy said is that back in Guatemala she'd been abused her life\nThreatened local police and gang members targeted her and her family I've seen records from the Guatemalan national police step back some of this out for her safety were not disclosing her full name or her kids named [noise] years ago Sandy had tried coming to the U.S illegally and\nYears ago Sandy had tried coming to the U.S illegally and got deported because of that it's unlikely she'll be able to get asylum now but she is eligible for something you could call asylum light which could allow her to stay in the U. S. and work\nRuby says Cindy's case to stay here is a strong one one of the strongest she heard during her visit to port Isabel Sandy also told Rudy about her four sons she hadn't seen them in about a month she described the moment her baby was taken from her\nShe told me that the card so they had to take her baby away\nShe said but I'm Still breastfeeding the ... you know and there's a does it matter she snow but I'm a breast feeding and they said oh we still have to take 'em and that are covered it took a breast feeding a baby\nOr were they just couldn't believe it [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I I don't know what else to say about that\n[laughter]\nI was never able to interview Sandy in person but I did get a chance to talk to her over the phone Sandy happened to call while I was visiting you'll does apartment in Southern California she was calling from the detention center to talk to her mom\nFor about\n... how are you my daughter\n[noise] get online\nSandy says she's desperate to leave I left is gone did you talk to the kids money\nFor to leave I left is gone did you talk to the kids money\n[noise]\nCindy tells you know the that whenever she talks to her kids on the phone they tell her they want to be with her she asks if illness been able to talk with him\nHe may have ... uh NBA ... a member of that yes because on friday they called I spoke with one of the kids you need some I mean he said mommy I Want to leave here I Want to go with you Neal mommy\nSandy says it's not just hurting punished it's the children to [noise] when Sandy says this looks like she's about to cry\nNow at them yeah nothing will the truth me uh I don't have words for you and I understand you as a mother\n\nSandy tells you that there's no one there to hug the baby no one to make him feel the warmth of his mother\nDo say has the same as with them and yes that was something else the children complained about that they don't let the kids hug the baby not the twelve year old eight year old or five year old I'm like well seemingly how is it possible that they don't let them hug each other you know I might be a new styles that but I they are brothers they have never been apart\n\nWould torment Sandy is not the baby's finally getting old enough to recognize people but the only people he's seeing are strangers\nGet their ... you have to have faith my daughter can go in because it's the saddest thing for a mother to be separated from her children tail so I don't mean you\nAnd me and what I mean that they at them and then I could think of anything that you are looking for that might have a good night we'll talk to more okay [noise] ... ... okay blessings Mike we couldn't they have in the in our family by my sweet girl\n\nI have a family by my sweet girl\n[laughter]\nYou'll just got her own story to tell just one that connect to Sandy's to hit us and the way\nShe says her family's been persecuted in Guatemala for generations I mean she lived their shirt to show me a scar that runs across her stomach skins wow you ... it looks like she was cut in half and selling back together for years she's avoided looking at it in the mirror\nEvery stick with us we put up a sign use maybe a lot of it does put out an email to me that I've been up and\nShe tells me it's a reminder of when she was kidnapped\nRaped and tortured you'll just family it was in the military during Guatemala's bloody civil war she thinks that has a lot to do with why she in Sandy were targeted ... who encouraged Sandy ... asked for asylum and do everything legally\nBut now that Sandy and the kids are locked up in a part of a sudden it feels like the whole asylum thing was a lie\n\nI reached out to ice and customs and border protection but they couldn't answer my question why did the government takes Sandy's kids this summer when there's no evidence that she crossed the border illegally\nAnd it wasn't just Sandy many parents who were never prosecuted for the we're still separated from their kids there are dozens of examples listed in a lawsuit against the government\nThe American civil liberties union is suing the Trump Administration over for separation of asylum seeking families\nThe lawsuit was filed back in February months before family separation was really in the news [noise]\nBefore family separation was really in the news\nThe cases famous now it's called miss el versus ice in court documents the administration to try to explain why it's separated those parents parents who hadn't been accused of entering the country illegally reading through you can see the government's argument shift\nFirst and said that separated the plaintiff and child because I wasn't sure they were really related but they were\nThat was proven by a DNA test so then the government argues different reasons about why they needed to be separated those arguments worn enough to persuade the court\nThe judge ruled that this type of family separation went beyond it's lawful reach\nIn the end I Can't tell you why the government separated children from parents like Sandy all I Know for sure is it wasn't about a crackdown on illegal immigration it wasn't about the Trump Administration enforcing the law\nBecause many families didn't break it\nYesterday or those California George Bush appointed by the way issued a nationwide injunction ordering immigration agents to take several new steps first\nIn late June the judge in that court case issued an injunction now there was a deadline a ticking clock the government would have to reunite families who've been separated whether they cross illegally are not kids would need to be back with their parents within thirty days the youngest even sooner\nTo reunite the youngest through migrant children with their families and our less than a week away\nSeparating families was one thing because the government put them back together it wasn't clear there was ever a plan for that it was a massive logistical\nIt wasn't clear there was ever a plan for that it was a massive logistical challenge we're talking about thousands of children and shelters across the country parents locked up thousands of miles away how is this going to happen\nThere are reports of mass confusion surrounding this process joining us now as Alex aides are the health and Human Services secretary Mr Secretary thank you for your time this morning there does seem to be a lot of confusion on this matter what can you tell us this morning declare some of that up\n... thank you for tough there's absolutely no confusion on our part uh we have the kids and we're working to comply with supports order and what that involves you know with\nThe government says everything's fine but with a deadline of July tend to just a few days away we call Sandy's mom you'll you'll that has no idea what's going to happen next you know the tells me there's a lot of confusion\nShe's had trouble reaching Sandy and attention and now she has to hand over documents proving she's related to the grand kids got warm ready or you know doesn't know when or if Sandy will see the kids again and if they're all back together how would they get to ...\n... yep letter has he won the\nDay before the deadline the Trump Administration admits it's not going to make it may be only half the youngest children will be reunited with their parents send these kids are in a shelter for migrant children in Phoenix, Arizona it's run by a Texas based company called south west key so I call it the company [noise]\n[noise] Hi sister he just ... from the Texas Tribune how are you fine\nThat's Jeff ... a spokesman for southwest key many of the kids separated at the border are staying at south west\nThat's Jeff ... a spokesman for southwest keep many of
