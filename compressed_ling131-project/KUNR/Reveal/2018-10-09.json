used to be in the navy and then the merchant Marines he's the son named print\nOr did you\nTone\nReally changes when he's talking about his book yeah his son Prince Albert has been locked up for seven years what's it like for your family to have him be a way for so long\nAs it was very very move you know [noise]\nJust Raj if you're in the yard [noise]\nOn to explain when George Zimmerman Aaron recruit\nConrad and his family are torn apart not just because princes in jail but because he's in jail for so long\nWill what did he do to get locked away for a long period of time\nNot so much what he did out the main reason he's still in jail is Louisiana's three strikes law it's called the habitual offender statue and usually don't hear about it until someone's charged for some minor crime like stealing a flight of sodas and the district attorney or chief prosecutor\nSome minor crime like stealing a flood of sodas and the district attorney or chief prosecutor Leon Kenneth Arrow uses the law to hammer them\nBusy Bernard noble has served four years of his more than Thirteen year sentence for carrying less than three grams of marijuana\nLouisiana has one of the strongest repeat offender laws to us and in New Orleans that could know put a man in prison for a possible Twenty years to life for stealing candy bars Kobe Brian\nWarren monitored or\nI've never met Conrad son prince in person but we talk on the phone when you say that again yeah\nPrince isn't a gel that's over five hours from New Orleans where he's from the phone is in this one huge noisy room where he also sleeps and beef and spends his days along with over a hundred other men we've been talking for months one day prince caught me when I was really stressed out\n[laughter]\n... my hair down did you say [laughter]\n[laughter]\nYou said he's looked at it because of the ... explain that well\nWas arrested a few times for drug charges which means he's known as a multiple offender or habitual offender and this law can now be applied to him here's how it works the more times you commit a felony the harsher and harsher punishment gets\nBut I did talk to a bunch of people from all different sides of the courtroom the first person used to work for Ken is arrow as an assistant prosecutor Gregory Thompson to how long were you a da\nAnd regular here's a seven years but in the years of job like an attorney\nThompson worked for Ken is zero right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office used the habitual offender statue back then\nWhen I was going on and on point I'm not going to the time I mean it was just some of the standard was even\nLower her job offers for lack of a better way of describing the other was when it was\nSo basically anytime that you could use that that too often or statute it was the policy of the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statue is as a tool like a ranch\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their tool box when they need it but it's like do you tend to zero never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere's is mines that are the more before we lock up in the more time that we give people the more we want to stop the crime problem is fine as long as ... you know harsh sentences or under turns\nNew Orleans public defender Danny ... says Ken is there is office still uses the ritual offender statue all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their record\nIt's the first thing you're looking at the start of every analysis of case every way you talk to your quiet as just started very way you talk to the prosecutor and to the judge it's even the considerations with the prosecutors making bail arguments or even from the moments of your arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge weren't leans parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was the middle of summer when it was over a hundred degrees outside he wasn't wearing a judge's robe instead black polo shirt black pants given the heat I had to tease him about it was this little light black\nOr right this is the life life is a lot of heavy but\nHe said over his blaring air conditioner the judge's job is kind of like our rafts between the defense and the prosecution asked judge hunter what he thinks of\nThis law it's actually pose a problem with a function of a judge which is to fashion the senses that support is just simply for that particular person\nWhen district attorney's use that had the chill offender statute judges\nBecause when district attorney's use the habitual offender statute judges no longer decide how long a person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory sentences kicking the judge has\nNo choice if I have someone with mental health issues or drug abuse issues I wanted\nTreatment aspect to conform to be part of the census with the ... on the twenty twenty five years that will be there no taxes think twenty twenty five thousand a year for someone just go away and said [noise]\nI also went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da Da Nang demon it's away just up the Mississippi River the populations of east Baton Rouge parish and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics around half white half black\nTheir da ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just like Leon cannons arrow\nI Lived in Chicago house or oh you did you ever talk so I'll be going on ... street\nHillary more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports again scan is there it was private Catholic highschool both are white men both have been da for a decade\nYou know for me I was with him as just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa Morsi's this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything there's public safety can you sort of certainly with no charm a Jew or does public safety really demand ...\nThe ten years he's been da ... office has used this law sixty six times now let's talk about what ...\nThis law sixty six times now let's talk about what da Kenneth Arrow does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data and the same ten years Ken is zero has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times [laughter]\n[noise]\nI shared this number what the da and his spokesman denied it the da's office only started keeping data on habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I have\nI never heard back in an email the DEA spokesman said their office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and shoes instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims [noise]\nThe reason these two da's act so different is because every da ... discretion to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if prints have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already\n[noise]\nFrom what you're saying it sounds like ... has the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken is there are always emphasizes this oh his duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nI'd be remiss if I had what I consider to be profitable case and simply said I'm not going to prosecute is because I just don't agree with the law\nThat's really not my called that's where you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not and if if it is the law I think I ever responsibility to prosecute\nThe law I think I ever responsibility to prosecute it if the facts in fact support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing and New Orleans [noise]\n\n\nKennedy arose line is I'm just doing my job why is he doing his job so differently than any other da in Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the habitual offender statute that's how it's done and\nThis man just hearing from a very squeaky chair can explain why my name is Ken Israel's than I\n...
