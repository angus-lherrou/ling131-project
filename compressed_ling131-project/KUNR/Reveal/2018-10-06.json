talking about his son\nYeah his son Prince Albert has been locked up for seven years what's it like for your family to have him be a way for so long\nAs it was very very you know [noise]\nJust Raj if you're in the yard [noise]\nHard to explain when you're gone\nOn display [noise] when I turned him every every\nConrad and his family are torn apart not just because princes in jail but because he's in jail for so long\nWill what did he do to get locked away for a long period of time\nIt's not so much what he did out the main reason he's still in jail is Louisiana's three strikes law it's called the habitual offender statue and usually you don't hear about it until someone's charged for some minor crime like stealing a flight of sodas\nAnd the district attorney or chief prosecutor Leon can is arrow uses the law to hammer them busy\nBernard noble has served four years of his more than Thirteen year sentence for carrying less than three grams of marijuana\nLouisiana has one of the strongest repeat offender laws in the U.S and in New Orleans that could know put a man in prison for a possible Twenty years to life for stealing candy bars Kobe Brian\nWarren Beatty monitored or\nI've never met Conrad son prince in person but we talk on the phone might say that again\n\nYeah princes on a gel that's over five hours from New Orleans where he's from the phone is in this one huge noisy room where he also sleeps and nice and spends his days along\nWith over a hundred other men we've been talking for months one day prince caught me when I was really stressed out [laughter]\n\n... my hair down did you say [laughter]\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nYou said he's looked at it because of the ... explain that well\nPrince was arrested a few times for drug charges which means he's known as a multiple offender or habitual offender and this law can now be applied to him here's how it works the more times you commit a felony the harsher and harsher punishment gets\nAnd regular here's a seven years and years of feels like an attorney\nWorked for tennis arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office used the habitual offender statue back then\nHow often the da's office used the habitual offender statue back then\nWhen I was in Ninety nine point nine percent of the time I mean it was just there was a standard that was as even\nLower her office for lack of a better way of describing a that was the way it was\nSo basically any time that you could use that that too often are statutes it was the policy of the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their tool box when they need it but it's like do you tend to zero never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere's is mines that are the more before we locked up in the more time that we give people the more we want to stop the crime problem punished fine as long as ... you know harsh sentences or under turns\nNew Orleans public defender Danny ... says Ken is there is office still uses the ritual offender statue all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their record\nIt's the first thing you're looking at the start of every analysis of case every way you talk to your client has started every way you talk to the prosecutor and to the judge it's even a consideration for the prosecutors making bail arguments or even from the moments\nOf your arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge weren't leans parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was the middle of summer when it was over a hundred degrees outside he wasn't wearing a judge's robe instead black polo shirt black pants given the heat I had to tease him about it\nOr right this is a life\nHeat I had to tease him about it\nAll right this is a life like this is a lot of heavy but\nHe said over his blaring air conditioner the judge's job is kind of like our rafts between the defense and the prosecution asked judge hunter what he thinks of\nThis law takes away the prom or the functions of a judge\nWas used to fashion a census that's appropriate specifically for that particular person\nBecause when district attorney's use the habitual offender statute judges no longer decide how long the person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory sentences kicking the judge has\nNo choice if I have someone with mental health issues or drug abuse issues I wanted that treatment asked to compose it'd be part of the sentence with the ... on the twenty twenty five years that will be there\nNo taxes they twenty twenty five thousand a year for someone just to go away in ... [noise]\nI also went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da da da da da da and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics around half white half black\nTheir da ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just like Leon cannons arrow\nAre losing a shark and Russia oh you do you're going to talk so I'll be going on ...\nStreet Hillary more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports against Ghana there it was private Catholic high school but they are white men both have been da ...\nIs there it was private Catholic high school but they are white men both have been da for a decade\nYou know for me is just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa more saved this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything or there's public safety can you serve certainly with no trauma Jew or does publish if you really demand ...\nAnd the ten years he's been da ... office has used this law sixty six times now let's talk about what ... does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data\nAnd the same ten years Kennedy era has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times and\n\nI shared this number with the da and his spokesman denied it the da's office only started keeping data on the habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I have\nI never heard back and an email the DEA spokesman said the office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and choose instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims\nThe reason these two da's act so different is because every da ... discretion to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if prints have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already\n[noise]\nFrom what you're saying it's like ... has the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken is there are always emphasizes this oh his duty now\nAnd Ken as always emphasizes this oh his duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nI'd be remiss if I had what I consider to be a profitable case and simply said I'm not going to prosecutors because I just don't agree with the law that's really not my call that's what you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not\nAnd if if it is a law I think I ever responsibility to prosecute it if the facts in fact support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing and New Orleans [noise]\n\n[noise] oh\nThe ... line is I'm just doing my job why does he doing his job so differently than any other da in Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the habitual offender statute that's how it's done and this man just hearing from a very squeaky chair can explain why\nMy name is Ken ... than I\n... I call\nA criminal law specialist\nAnd I heard that really you go by Becky\nMay be a Jew gee we're big you would do a ... a ...\nYou know this is my ... my war room [laughter]\nIt's next to his kitchen and full of paper stacked by his computer taped to the walls this is where biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the Senate\nIs where biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the seventies he saw this law which had been around for a really long time basically come back from the dead because the law the multiple bell which is one of its many names\nNobody was doing this but when Harry counting came into office\nWe'll we'll we'll ... we'll wait a minute you did did you just say Harry Cohn exists the jazz singer no that's a junior [noise]\nThis was his dad Harry ... senior\nWhen Harry ... came into office he use multiple below two shows toughness so she'll society that he's going to put people in jail for the rest of their lives\nKind of was the da of New Orleans for Thirty years and kind of a tough on crime trailblazer\nHe first ran in Nineteen Seventy three and promised to use the habitual offender statue much more aggressively here's one of his newspaper ads\nAs district attorney Eric comic budget to use the powers of hers offer to help her image or your system but time and time again returns habitual offenders to continue their uninhibited crimes against decent citizen [noise]\nThis was the Nineteen seventies and crime is urging all over the country people were scared\nSounds like kind of played on that ... so he brought this law back from when ... when does it start\nWell the first mentioned I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nIf any first shot a third time be convicted of any crime you shall be considered as armed forces I envy him isn't that a labor for live\nThrough this whole story I I've been thinking about how race\nSo this whole story I I've been thinking about how race is connected to all of this and and that line unfit for society I mean it it just sounds like something right out of the races handbook right\nYeah I I talked to a historian about that John barred studies the history of incarceration in Louisiana at Tulane University\nI think the fact that ... really came in their own as part of this intensely racialized mass incarceration undoubtedly speaks to imagining the conflict as scary African American man\nThe kind of man who can never be rehabilitated an penitentiary\nAnd for people who couldn't be transformed it it would become a place for storage for forced labor forced labor wow\nAnd this leads us right back to a biggie before he became an expert on the law he fought in the Vietnam War where he also picked up a drug habit and when he returned home to Louisiana biggie killed a man and a botched robbery something he attributes to his addiction and untreated post traumatic stress\nNone it's behind the scenes part of verbal ... negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys\nAnd remember in these cases ... officially charges the habitual offender statute his prosecutors just say they will if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just disappear\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking about here\nRight we know Ken is there a used a lot in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOf course Ken is there refused to be interviewed for this story\nWhich is frustrating because he's an elected official but he did offer a statement about princes case\nHere a few parts that stood out to me Mr Albert voluntarily entered into a ... agreement and received a legal sense under Louisiana law if he believed himself not guilty he could've exercised his constitutional right to stand trial then Kennedy era said\nMy hope is that Mr Albert will apply himself toward programs by which to better himself and eradicate his substance abuse issues while in prison\n\nAfter I requested to interview ... he was moved from one jail to another to begin a drug program I asked him if this was the first time in his seven years locked up that he'd been in a program to treat addiction our connection wasn't great\n[noise] when did you do the first one [noise]\nTo lose so that was like six years and years\n[noise]\nTo limit so that was like six years into your sentence\n[noise]\nPrint said it took awhile for him to enter a program because they didn't really have programs [noise]\n\nJust wasting time sitting in one dormitory with a hundred and twenty people doing nothing\nAnd seven years he's got three to go has anything changed for you\nA lot of fame must love zone one goose being away from those I'm trying to move to treat the way you want to move to ... one of them are too many of them were you know\n...\nA few times now printed asked me to give a message to his oldest son prince junior these calls are expensive and his son can always afford them anyway prince asks me to tell us on he misses him and then he says tell them I Love them and I do [noise]\n\nEven a rooms in New Orleans for that story her podcast is called

almost one point seven million dollars to back the campaign of men who never prosecuted the case in his life\nWithout further ado the district attorney of Philadelphia\nReveals more such as he has the story of a total outsider trying to change how justice is done\nMore to it\nIn a sliver co working space right by city hall about forty fresh faced assistant prosecutors are meeting their new

room some just a law school that almost everything they've heard about being a prosecutor is wrong\nThe obligation of a prosecutor to seek justice cannot simply be defined as if this is a sports event

police department dozens of times he tells the new recruits his goal to send fewer people to jail to end mass incarceration in Philly entirely some of them are nodding along\nBut the old guard prosecutors working at the da's office when ... took the helm last winter they were a harder sell\nWe carefully vetted people who we thought might never be down for this mission uh and we ask them to leave and they left\nThe purge was on full display is the file boxers get blown out of the ... thirty one staffers including a number of murder squad prosecutors heartbreaking deputies and division chiefs were among those terminated\nThis local ABC News footage showed lawyers mostly older white men dragging boxes of paper through the January slush then in February crafts are told me came the

policies and an internal staff memo which got late [noise] it's a long document here just a few of those bullet points\nFor most non violent crimes his prosecutors should offer the lowest possible sentence they should stop charging anybody arrested for marijuana possession they should stop charging most prostitution cases shoplifters stealing small amounts should just get a ticket the idea was it\nWe should just get a ticket the idea was to stop jailing people who are homeless or poor or who have problems with drugs and get them help instead [noise]\nPlanned wherever tackle runs crashing
