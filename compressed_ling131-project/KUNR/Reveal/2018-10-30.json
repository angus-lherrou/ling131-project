honestly it was really discouraging does\nThe fact that under less close that landlords have very little financial risk and yet there's still so cautious of the program does that suggest that there's that there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nThat's exactly what that suggests and I hate to say that but it I mean it is a reality of what it is right now I'm ... they have this
