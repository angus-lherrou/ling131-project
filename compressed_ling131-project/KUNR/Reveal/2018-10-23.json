into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines she has is the kind Georgia uses edits polling places the machine it's bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between the Nintendo and the Bible Logan ...\nSays act you touch ... glitter and then it's decompress being the image\nIs one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that full time at the beginning\nUse that as a ring time and this is a direct recording electronic machine or DRA it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cybersecurity type that's a major red flag\nIn fact dear he's had been criticized by technologist basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines is paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again like last march at us\nFor years more and more people are pushing to start using them again like last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen you wanted to get her official position on electronic voting machines\nAnd I'd like to get your views for the record\nOf whether you believe the continued use of paperless voting machines in this country threatens our national security and the department is now prepared to recommend paper ballots\nAnd so Yes sir if there is no way to audit the election that is absolutely a national security

judging Amy Totenberg filed an order\nAnd for the midterm elections judge any Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to a paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's taste in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system by the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none of that\nPacking she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they didn't mean as paranoia the research based findings of national\nCyber security engineers an expert [noise] so that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards the terms with a formal systems the machines that very few people trust\nKennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does\nThe people I talked to said that change will really make much of a difference they say if a hacker\nGot the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight teams and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg has ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first you know that we know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question let me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned\n\nReveals by Duncan brought us that story earlier this\nIt brought us that story\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp established a commission that look at options for policing the curb voting system by twenty twenty oh in the other four states heading into the midterms they use touch screen machines with no paper audit trail or New Jersey Delaware South Carolina in Louisiana [noise]\n\n\n\nFear of voter fraud is driving a lot of efforts to restrict access to voting around the country but where is that fear coming from that's next on reveal from the center for investigative reporting NPR\n[noise]\nOn the next fresh air voting rights and voting restrictions we talked with Ari Berman author of give us the ballot twenty four states have implemented new restrictions disproportionately affecting minorities\nRanging from requiring voter id is to closing polling places also tell us about the seven states were efforts are being made to expand voting rights join us\n\nFresh air tomorrow afternoon at two o'clock here on K U unarmed follows BBC News hour [noise]\nFrom the center for investigative reporting NPR ... this is reveal I'm allergic to date we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud\nPeople are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been saying\nIn many places like California the same person votes many times you've probably heard about that [noise] they always like to say oh that's a conspiracy theory not a conspiracy theorist Alex millions and millions of people\nLose claims have been totally ... but one of the people who got those theories going was a Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach he's the Kansas secretary of state\nAnd while that's typically a pretty sleepy office he's a household name in his home state even used to have a weekly radio show\nThe ACLU worst nightmare\n'cause he knows the constitution terrified to keep them from making trouble for any of it is Kris\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning Trump appointed him to run his so called election integrity commission it was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything Peggy Lowe of Casey you are in Kansas City has been covering Kobach for years\nHey hey yeah so Kobach is from a small state population wise but he has a big national profile in conservative circles how did that happen\nSo Kobach is a longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people and question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that dating back to about twenty ten\nThe law that dating back to about twenty ten\nAnd since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who back to that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native his movement\nSince then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud\nKobach claims that illegal aliens that's attorney loves to use our voting in great numbers and this fraud could be swinging elections but way we know that that is not true that is right now I could through a bunch of little zeroes in percentages at you here but\nAccording to the Brennan Center for justice it would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate another voter but that doesn't stop Kobach he's a leader in the fight against it as well it's a major problem\n\nYou interview cookbook last summer what was the looking person well you know come up makes a really good politicians he's good looking he's charming he's really articulate\nBut as a reporter he is also just maddening he will tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight chew on every term and you guys just said it\nWould be they use the\n... is an accurate it's not off line then you will throw all these studies and statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he's still uses them it's like talking to Kris Kobach is arguing with your high school debate coach\nYou know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument and I think he's really respect\nTo a guy who really wants you to lose the argument and I\nThink he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degrees from Harvard Yale University of Oxford and\nThen he also has this other big help it's a tool called the interstate cross check system it's a massive voter tracking program under Kobach agreed to include more than half of the total voter registration in the U.S\nOkay so how does this thing work\nSo about two dozen states are enrolled in this cross check program it's free they share information between states keeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicate voter registrations\nAnd most often this happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California\nDid you call the secretary of state in Florida\n[laughter] no I did not that's okay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not illegal to be registered to vote in two states\nThat said it is illegal to vote in the same election in two different states\nServes Kobach uses cross strict system to go after voter fraud\nThis is where Kobach signed in using cross check Kobach persuaded the Kansas Legislature to give him the power to prosecute these cases by himself so he doesn't have to turn them over to the attorney general's office like the way it's done in all these other states\nOkay so all of a sudden Kris Kobach has the power of a prosecutor what's he doing with it well\nSo far he's turned up nine cases of this alleged voter fraud he's prosecuted them as felonies and they mostly played it down to misdemeanors and most of the people", "show_name": "Reveal", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "23"}
