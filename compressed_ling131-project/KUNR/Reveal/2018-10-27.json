Cynthia says they think it comes down to money\nThere's no question you know that the the guy that make the notion of having a guy by the end my care effect that all of us in terms of tourism\nIt's the lifeblood of the island\nSome tourism it's the lifeblood of the island I reach out to the Puerto Rico tourism association and talk to the organizations president and CEO Clarissa Jimenez about how much ... affected the island\nIt was a huge in fact\nThere is the remembers when the CDC first issued warnings about the ... in Puerto Rico into thousands sixteen\nThe number they weren't even were really really high and scary I we had lots of cancellations you know there was a\nThe perception that you would do that here and you would get the virus I mean because that was what was portrayed you know those huge percentages of the population and getting the virus\nTourists stayed away and the island lost one hundred million dollars and that she says shouldn't have happened\nOh let me see how they say so their realities that a lot of hype was created\nAfter Hurricane Maria the government wanted to build back the tourism economy as quickly as possible and doctors I talked with believed that meant getting rid of the ...\n...\nKnows the league it is still in rent and so she's found a way to restart testing of pregnant women\nFor ... and I feel this is so important to be able to identify because most of their patients will have seek out do not have any symptoms ... and they think they might be at risk for these things and\nCarmen did an end run around Puerto Rico's health department she teamed up with the CDC to provide free testing for pregnant women it's the only program like it on the island\nTesting for pregnant women it's the only program like it on the island\nSo that we're starting to think I ... and you have written\nOn the first day back in the spring eight women had their blood drawn including Melissa\nIt's always been a concern\nBecause I think people sick with the

and even though it's a small sample there alarming nine percent of women are testing positive and that's almost with the rate was at the height of the epidemic\nSign the semi researcher I'm not running for anybody because we'll see Sean therefore I kind of on any name Wendy evidence dance me to say\nAnd the evidence is telling Carmen ... is a very real danger today for pregnant women and babies in Puerto Rico around twenty six thousand women will give birth this year so far fewer than three hundred have been tested for ...\nI'd be no situation for one I'm thirty six years I've been blessed oh bean brain sent for they burst of so many babies and I continue that the first thing I Will might ask my baby I think he's uh\nTell you that the first thing that we might ask my baby I think it's a it's anti calling their sense that we need to do it we need to the day right dean Martin\nAnd\nThat story was from Beth Murphy at the ground truth project she's the director of films there and also has a short film coming out about this story\nAnd we check with the CDC about seeking Puerto Rico one of the epidemiology told us that the risk of\nGetting Z can now is less than during the outbreak a couple of years ago but the\nVirus will always be there and people need to protect themselves from Skittles and sexual transmission to avoid\nGetting infected ... ... ... ... ... ... in a moment we hit back to the mainland Houston, Texas where a year after Hurricane Harvey people who are using a government program to pay for housing or getting the door shut in their faces and you're

live from here six to eight o'clock okay you win our\n[noise]\nThe guy said okay you can rent this house and five years after ... and the kids move than she bought her own house [noise]\nThis is why Pam does this work today and why she's trying so hard for Denise in Cook County Illinois where Denise from rejecting someone just because they have a section ... voucher is considered discrimination and it's illegal\nIt's also a legal and a handful of states including Massachusetts Oregon and New Jersey [noise]\nA few years ago Austin, Texas passed an ordinance like this but a few months later the state legislature overturned it and lawmakers went even further they ban any other city in Texas from doing the same thing\nBasically Texas landlords are allowed to discriminate against people with section ... vouchers and they can't be punished for it [noise]\nIn Texas was one of the first states in the country to pass a law like this and twenty Fifteen Indiana did to the same year the needs to know about the law when she moved here\nYour daughter the she understand that some people don't take vouchers and some people do take altered so she got that what she she gets back to a certain extent but I don't know how to understand the uh [noise]\nThe discrimination all part of it [noise]\nI don't want her to feel stereotype because of a voucher [noise]\nOf a voucher [noise]\nDenise was really hoping to use her voucher and one of two suburban ZIP codes both majority white very low poverty better schools [noise]\nPut out of a Seventeen thousand families that get vouchers from the Houston housing authority we found that only thirty six were living in those in post so what's going on here why are so many landlord unwilling to take out in Texas\nBut I don't think there's the ... section eight is a discriminatory too\nLittle this is Stacey Hi he's on the board of the Houston apartment association and he supports that Texas law that lets landlords they notice section eight\nAfter it passed housing advocacy group sued they said this is racial discrimination in disguise my colleague Edgar Walter interviewed Stacey on earlier this year and brought this up\nThere have been all these lawsuits have alleging that discrimination against voucher holders what do you say to that\nOr an disagree with that but I think that that the voucher users in many situations you know they choose to live for their support group for their family is where transportation where their job is\nWe spoke to more than a dozen voucher holders and none of them told us that Andrew told Stacey ... about Denise\nShe just heard from dozens and dozens of landlords you know like sorry we just don't accept section eight is discrimination or ... or stereotyping at least part of what's at issue\nThe books it's reflective of because everyone has to deal with you very stringent fair housing requirements all across this country\nTold Edgar there are plenty of legitimate reasons Texas landlords don't take vouchers the section eight program is run by government agencies that don't have enough staff and they are known to cut checks late Stacy says this kinda hurts\nThat don't have enough staff and they are known to cut checks late Stacy says this can hurt a landlords bottom line and they shouldn't be forced to deal with it but he did have a suggestion for Denise\n... through for this lady or would have ... the cold to people in this course\nNest quest we'd\nHeard that name a lot during our reporting the bureaucracy affectionate is so bad Houston officials created an entirely new nonprofit last year to help deal with it and didn't want us to see if ness quest could really help people like Denise so I'll let him take it from here\nHere's how nest quest works they find landlords in areas with high rated schools who don't take vouchers then they make a pitch\nWhat does family with a voucher live here and we'll deal with the government for you\nOn time rental payments those are automatic\nWe also secure all the utilities for the Internet ... does not have to do anything this Isabel Lopez executive director of nest quest and we also guarantee that the climate will maintain renters insurance in the unit [noise] um and then upon move out we are willing to foot the bill for any damages\nWhen Isabelle took this job that's caused title one point two million dollar grant to spend\nThe goal helps three hundred and fifty families with children moved to neighborhoods with top rated schools\nI was extremely optimistic easy like I don't see anybody saying no to that and the first time we actually had it hard talking to the landlord and was honestly it was really discouraging\nDoes the fact that under less close the landlords have very little financial risk and yet there's still so cautious of the program does that suggest that there's but there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nBut there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nThat's exactly what that suggests and I hate to say that but it I mean it is a reality of what it is right now\nI'm ... they have this guarantee that everything will work like that everything's going to take get taken care of and it still that hesitation that I don't want to warn when someone who's on section eight\nAs a mid October only Seventeen families with vouchers are renting places ... help\nFive of them are staying in poverty is managed by the company Stacey hunt works for that sort of thirty eight thousand units his company managers in the Houston area\nFive out of thirty eight thousand I talked to you about this you know it seems like cold comfort to somebody like Denise\nWhere it's real like certain room when bill to the day I mean we're we're ... the industry's Troy and\nIn July three months after we first met Denise she was still looking for a place in her voucher was about to expire the deadline came and went\nBut I couldn't get in touch with her and told me Denise was really stressed out and needed some space than a few weeks later I get a Facebook invite for Pam she's holding this women's empowerment conference around the anniversary of the hurricane it's called\nI Survived it and Denise is going to be there sooner early September I drive down to Houston to this little church not far from his office [noise]\nEasy it is\nI Walk inside and I see Pam at the front of the sanctuary gripping a microphone and piecing back and forth\nThe Pam at the front of the sanctuary gripping a microphone and pacing back and forth there is about a dozen people sitting in the pews dressed in their Sunday Best despite the Houston humidity hands got the crowd going\nThink about how [noise]\nMaybe somebody\nOther after her sermon I catch up with pastor Pam can you just tell me a little bit what does this weekend\nAbout survivor is\nThe anniversary of the Harvey you know the one year after Harvey people displaced people still going through things brings survivors together and share this story\nThe morning is packed with prayer and personal testimony is Denise gets up and talks about her struggles to find housing in a new city when we break for brunch I finally get a chance to ask her if she found an apartment she says yes\nAnd how do you like it just the way I thought if\nIt's a cell phone my head right now I won't complain a diplomatic way of putting it [noise]\nIs mine Denise was not able to find a diverse mixed income neighborhood she was looking for when she left Chicago more than twenty percent of her new neighbors live below the poverty line and almost all of them are black or Hispanic and as for the apartment\nThey really almost look like the project from Scott as it ain't nothing but a group of people hang on a fixed income
