A. P. E. and Atlanta Johnny Kauffman is W. A. B. east political reporter and he gets a started in southern Georgia [laughter]\n[noise] it's weeks before the midterm elections I mean a small town called ... treat writing in the back seat of a Ford Focus that's moving slowly down the street it's getting dark and three women from a local chapter of the Democratic party are appearing at the house number's\nForce and next we'll say forget the

out and cast a vote or the person of their choice [noise]\nHer friends are waiting for her in the car but she pauses for a second\nIf a person think that my vote not won't count a no vote is just like a yes vote you that that's telling them that you don't care one way or the other but as a responsible citizen and a person in the state of Georgia you need to vote\nYou really do you need to teach your children the importance of voting you go out and you beat the bushes and you complain but you don't vote\nAnd famous find out\nKnow hey I'm handle I can say that I'm a reporter with public radio and John\nA story about people who than removed from the voter last I don't know if you've heard about this thing\nAngela explains how Georgia cancels voters who don't turn out in multiple elections and then in some places blacks are being pulled off the rules at a disproportionate rates\nSo you registered to vote in two thousand and eight years ever that Obama is\nIn a do you remember that Obama is running do you remember\nA hand in my mind you know the vote for him or they're hurt or anything [noise]\nSo then uh last July he were taken off the voter lists are so I'd have been on July twenty eighth of twenty Seventeen um but you didn't get any notification that you'd\nHave been some there's no\nDid you know that there is a policy that they take us if you don't vote\nYou\nMiss ponder tells us she had no idea she'd been purged although she didn't seem completely surprised she says she hasn't been a regular voter but she's thinking about turning out in November to support Stacey Abrams for governor always aware of the things that you back and Reverend ponders office angel it gives him the news about his aunt\nShe still lives within the county but she's been removed from the voter list and she had no idea\n... that's interesting is she was never notify or anything\nShe doesn't recall ever getting anything from election officials\n[noise] well I think we need to get down to the bottom of because if it happened to her\nTo bring them she she ... she says it just confirms his view that voter suppression is happening\nIt almost give people do the mindset that business is a privilege not a right and so now anything that has approved which has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we won't give you permission to use his privilege\nSays he'll take is on to re register\nWe will give you permission to use his privilege\nHe says he'll take is on to re register so she can vote in the governor's race [noise]\n\n\nWe analyze all the people purged in Georgia just last year and we found that about a hundred thousand vermouth for not voting and not responding to notices\nNow we don't know how it breaks down by race\nBut if you add in other obstacles like a voter id law enclosed polling places all this could tip a close race for governor when it comes to the purges Stacey Abrams and other Democrats said there's this illusion\nLet people register all the way to election day at least Seventeen states have same day registration but not in Georgia Brian Kemp opposes it and same with other Republicans\nIn states where you have the same day registration it leads to irrational voting Brian Robinson is a Republican strategist I meet him in the marble halls of Georgia State house\nBrands he's voting as a write in to privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is outright period Brian sings registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree uh who knows what the issues are and what the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think is that a magistrate of headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate abet a John how does it distorted the electorate [noise]\nI don't know how you describe it frankly I'm at a loss on on that bought it\nFrankly I'm at a loss all all that but if you don't know an October the first so there's a presidential election or a gubernatorial election and uh the first two weeks of November you're not an informed voter\nBrian argues purging people for not voting isn't taking anything from them because they're not voters\nLike it if the presidential election and in fact two presidential elections don't get you out I don't know what is going to take to get you out and I don't care what color you are what your partisanship is I think that's fair standard\nBrian looks at the governor's race like this it's all about who shows up at the polls camp wins it the racial breakdown of voters days about where it's been in recent elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really tough\nYou have to polarized angry tribes going at each other you look at the falling today there's almost no one decided [noise]\n\nThat story from Johnny Kauffman of public radio station W. A. V. E. in as little poodle from a PM reports [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] when it comes to voting something else distinguishes Georgia from most other states it's voting machines are easy targets for computer hackers was what you were doing here even technically hacking\nI Would not counted as hacking or what was it then [noise] it was it was browsing the Web site that's coming\nIs hacking or what was it then [noise] it was it was browsing the Web site that's coming up next on reveal\n[noise] [noise]\n\nYeah\nThis is reveal uncanny you in our public radio ... things for spending some time with us this afternoon or bringing new great programs into the evening weekend all things considered is up next and then music till midnight\nYeah\nCan you win our get support from our town presenting complex in from ...\nThe innovative dance company reinvent the artist damp through a groundbreaking mix of style it's an art town experience it's tomorrow night at the pioneer center and tickets are available online at pioneer center dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nFrom the center for investigative reporting in P. R. X is is is revealed lets up till now we've been talking about all the barriers\nTo prevent people from stepping into a voting booth on election day like getting to the polling station in finding out your name is on the list [noise]\nBut even if you get into the booth your vote might not be properly counted [noise] Georgia is one of five states that rely solely\nOn touch screen voting machines with no paper audit trail cyber experts warned about these machines for years\nCyber experts have warned about these machines for years and recently so as President Trump\nOne of the things we're learning is it's always good it's old fashioned but it's always good to have a paper\nBackup system of voting it's called paper not\nHighly complex computers paper\nThere's a real cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted twelve Russian agents for ... to target county Web sites in Georgia a lot of security experts are worried that when it comes to heckling Georgia is one of the most vulnerable states in the country but are the people in charge of election they're actually listen\nReveals by Duncan picks up the story [noise]\nYeah so uh right now I'm like in the machine in Logan lamb has a voting machine in his living room [noise] this is what one looks like on the inside so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta his specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines he has is the kind Georgia uses edits polling places the machine it's bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between a Nintendo and the Bible Logan boots it up\nSo it was actually touch ... glitter and then it's decompress being the image\nIs the one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that full time at the beginning\nUse that as Irene came to this is a direct recording electronic machine or DRA it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cyber security tightened that's a major red flag in fact\nFor Logan and other cybersecurity type that's a major red flag\nIn fact dear he's had been criticized by technologist basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines as paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again\nLike last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nYou wanted to get her official position on electronic voting machines\nAnd I'd like to get your views for the record\nOf whether you believe the continued use of paperless voting machines in this country threatens our national security and the department is now prepared to recommend paper ballots\nAnd so Yes sir if there is no way to audit the election that is absolutely a national security concern why didn't look satisfied and you now told us that the status quo is a national security threat\nHe studies the arteries and their vulnerability that says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really it can inject information or inject basically now we're a virus into any part of the tree the way it is set up is that that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the tree\nLong after Logan downloaded all that data a second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly\nThey asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta it was grueling took all day you at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable one of them even hacked a voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side were ... people\nMachine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side we're camps people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic wind for the midterm elections\nJudge any Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's pace in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system by the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none of that\nPacking she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will failed to address that reality if they'd demean as paranoia the research based findings of national\nCyber security engineers an expert [noise] so that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with the vulnerable systems and machines but very few people trust Kennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does\nThe people I talked to say that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker\nGot the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight teams and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg is ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that we know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question let me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you\nI asked him a question let me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned [noise]\nReveals by don't get brought us that story\n\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp said was to commission that'll look at options for policing the curb voting system by twenty twenty oh in the other four states heading into the midterms they used to touch screen machines with no paper audit trail or New Jersey Delaware South Carolina in Louisiana [noise]\n\n\n\nFear of voter fraud is driving a lot of efforts to restrict access to voting around the country but where is that fear coming

R. ... this is reveal a mail it today we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud\nPeople are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been seeing\nIn many places like California the same person votes many times you probably heard about that they always like to say oh that's a conspiracy if they're not a conspiracy theorist Alex millions and millions of people lose claims\nHave been totally the bar but one of the people who got those theories going was a Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach he's the Kansas secretary of state\nAnd while that's typically a pretty sleepy office he's a household name in his home state even used to have a weekly radio show\nThe the ACLU worst nightmare\n'cause he knows the constitution terrified to keep them from making trouble for any of it is Kris\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning Trump appointed him to run his so called election integrity commission it was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything Peggy Lowe of Casey you are in Kansas City has been covering Kobach for years\nThey pay half so Kobach is from a small state population wise but\nHey yeah so Kobach is from a small state population was but he has this big national profile in conservative circles how did that happen\nSo Kobach is a longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people in question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that's dating back to about twenty ten\nAnd since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who backed that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native his movement\nSince then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud Kobach claims that illegal aliens that's a term he loves to use our voting in great numbers and this fraud could be swinging elections\nBut way we know that that is not true\nThat is right now I could through a bunch of little zeroes in percentages at you here but\nAccording to the Brennan Center for justice it would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate another voter but that doesn't stop Kobach he's a leader in the fight against this well it's a major problem\n[noise]\nYou interview Kobach last summer what was the looking person\nYou know come what makes a really good politician he's good looking he's charming he's really articulate but as a reporter he is also just maddening he will tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight chew on every term and you guys have said it would be the failed her\nEvery term and he said it would be they use the\nLine as an actor and it's not off line than you will throw all these studies and statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he's still uses them\nIt's like talking to Kris Kobach is arguing with your high school debate coach\nYou know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument\nAnd I think he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degrees from Harvard Yale University of Oxford and then he also has this other big help it's a tool called the interstate cross check system\nIt's a massive voter tracking program under Kobach agreed to include more than half of the total voter registrations\nIn the U.S okay so how\nDoes this thing work so about two dozen states are enrolled in this cross check program it's free\nThey share information between states keeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicate voter registrations and most often this happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California\nDid you call the secretary of state in Florida\n[laughter] no I did not that's okay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not illegal to be registered to vote in two states\nThat said it is illegal to vote in the same election into different stage so Kobach uses cross strict system to go after voter fraud\nThis is where ... signed in using cross check Kobach persuaded the Kansas Legislature to give him the power to prosecute these cases by himself so he\nGive him the power to prosecute these cases by himself so he doesn't have to turn them over to the attorney general's office like the way it's done and all these other states\nOkay so all of a sudden Kris Kobach has the power of a prosecutor what's he doing with it\nWell so far he's turned up nine cases of this alleged voter fraud he's prosecuted them as felonies and they mostly played it down to misdemeanors", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Reveal", "city": "Reno", "day": "20"}
