risk for them um in terms of their facilities and\nIf they aren't out ahead on this they might get slapped with a carbon policy that they don't like that doesn't actually work in their favor and

is science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is it ...\nA C section is not unusual but what is unusual is it a number of C sections happening all over the world listen to this worldwide rate\nHas nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section how\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is uptick what are the effects on mothers in babies\nAnd what into ... can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rapes globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner you get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number\nA poor for seven to for eight to five five you can tweet us ... fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy's an author author on that a Lancet series he's also professor of midwife midwifery\nAt the Yale School of nursing thank you for joining us today alec enemy\nThanking a tell us the Lancet series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries an overall there is a rising C section rates can you give us some of the numbers of different regions must have buried around the world\n[noise] well it does and and what we found was that over sixty percent of countries overuse C sections and twenty five percent under use that weren't procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons and part of it has to do with um\nThe and sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery is enormous um thing to do\nExcept in sub surgery is enormous um thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough to access probably are under using it for the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... about right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as this area and we're way\nOver was talking about over by us there's it's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to you know the the interaction but\nBut you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted normative part of the culture\nIt's an accepted normative part of the culture in in Brazil\nMhm are there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what ... percent sixty two percent depending on the province [noise]\nExactly and again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this as area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\nI'm ... says area and is not a low risk um surgery it is it's a major surgery and and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states were increasing maternal mortality rate\n... you mentioned at the in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like\nAnd why they're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when a woman really needs it and I think it's important to to staying at the outside there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nI Want to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing\nIt's happening here in the U.S and why C sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be\nVice chair of quality in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr going thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um\n... there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the do the do you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen there's been your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic and the ... and the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have a delivery biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver I'm In our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise in Syrian delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and\nYeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make the recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible on it's a complex and\nThat's who's responsible um it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics so there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\nOn the progress string labor in terms of the cervical dial a nation I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on a labor and delivery unit that might put some pressure on us to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision I'm as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes\nAnd a highly what's your reaction to\nAll I Would completely agree with her that the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having a bad gentle birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her\nAnd her physiology two two best achieved ... birth\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern

I kinda had to do all of that\nUm education investigation on my ... I had to look at the website I had to look at rates and what were the risk for me and my DVD you took pregnancy and um it really was up to me it was um like my provider\nAll that you want to have a repeat of the time I was like oh sure I'll have a repeat that but I wasn't given the risks and benefits of those that to be able to make a truly educated decision um and so I think that um I was able to\nI actually had an extra ... heat and then I changed my mind at thirty six and my provider with really awesome with that and I was able to have you back but I feel like there wasn't a lot of information given to me by my provider I really had to search ... okay in a lot of the information\nWas very emotional and it was really hard to find the facts\nAre learning ... let me get let me get rid of its great great call when we get a quick reaction atone even ... you know I'm truth be told I mean she should [laughter] and I'm One of three you back in the day everybody had to have one ... one after another and born was sort of thing you know I didn't know that maybe I didn't have to have\nGreat weather ahead certainly help you get a chance to enjoy it and the great outdoors you're listening decay when [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increase in the number of C sections and what that means for women's health\nMy guests are Dr highly Kennedy professor of midway free at the Yale School of nursing next to Tony going vice chair of quality in a department of of a statue tricks and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get to everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k.\nHow you you work in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach beer compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWilling in it a differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out the W. World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help\nHelp us look at decreasing says Erin's and and one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was a a sociology with improved outcomes increase the including decreasing C sections and so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midway free across each state to see how how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest C section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent adverse are attended by mid was in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent adverse are attended by midwives and then they met that with outcomes and if\nYou look at Alabama Alabama has some of them\nComes and if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by mid was so that's not a causation it as an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um we do have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nA tornado when you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\n[noise] well first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says Erin I'm first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor\nThat kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite an accurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use feel heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart\nTrying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific modern definitions for progress in labor\nOr old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than newer more modern data really prove to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiasm for be back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFrom misspoke here at the Beth Israel and to do with your family is from so blown down here in Boston and so there's this whole me now to the to the hospital you go to determines moralistic you'll have a C section Ina\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on Syrian delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr wherever tweeter vets relevant to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a ...\nHas to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that in your your your report\nHolly [noise] well uh ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or were wealthier we'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for this area and to really um level that playing field in it and in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one\nIn in time or perceived to be in time [noise]\nYour your your shoe of reimbursement as is interesting here in the U.S a where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery than necessary and delivery\nHowever the hospital does and that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients on and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here and the U.S a reimbursement is greater but it really goes more toward the hospital side because of the length of today and let's go to Sharon in Somerville Mass Hi Sarah\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they\nHi I'm\nI've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications from Crohn's disease and so I'm I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends think things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if he could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that\nEnd of his questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know push the baby out ... and and that was really upsetting to me because my two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those at the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions\nAnd I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um in different directions slides I'd love to hear the response\nOr I got about a minute to tone of your own\nWhich I Would I Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that\nYou have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... since the Syrian or fully ... fully discussion and Tony what about this in charge of sexism their\nPoint well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous uh\nTaken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how baby is born\nI'm the person who gets birth to the baby becomes apparent uh after that happens on it's no less are no more regardless of what the motive delivery is and says area and delivery on certainly makes you just as much as a

old piano roll music that we really can't hear or listen to without the interface I thought to make a digital interface for it so this will read the federal and it will play out of that synthesizer how that synthesizer\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the typical ... plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\nThink about bees and aunts and spiders tiny as they are in their own vital parts of our ecosystem weather as food or pollinators are predators and they have another thing in common complex social behavior I think about the term hive mind right\nThis idea that all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world\nBut how well does that actually work out what factors make a colony more or less successful\nAnd can individual behavior still tilt the hand of faith for the whole group\nOr the hives indeed legion\nMy next guest looked at these questions how his word is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the lives of bumblebees and Noah picked a woman is an associate professor at UCLA looking at these social behavior of bees ants and even spider [noise]\n\nWhat did you know I if you ask everybody you they'll tell you that honeybees get all the attention right and but but\nIf you ask everybody you built tell you that honeybees get older your picture writing a book you've gravitated to bumble ...\nActually did my PHD in a honeybee labs are but I went rogue and worked on bumblebees instead I started when a PHD in two thousand six which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it was sequenced we suddenly had this tool kit that we could use to answer all kinds of\nReally cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I started fell in love with bomb will be use and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to only bees bumblebees have a very different like photo right out of the colonies gets started\nFirst honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social uh there's never a point in their lives in the life of a honeybee queen\nOr she's living on her own but bumblebees are different um they have an annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony and he's queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring I these queens have to crawl out of there over wintering spot\nAnd start their own nests so they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though there are social insects and they have queens and workers and this sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle to\nYou and you weren't brought on this show is with ...\nDid yes you'll notice from the get go that it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees to actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these ... groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor was social but since that time you know a lot\nMillion years ago and we think that that ancestor with social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way the ... the way that they live\nAbout ... meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we turned to confuse the two kinds of bees is having equals lifestyles all the time we really well to be\nTo be right well I consider honeybees is a ... and ... my lab actually studies ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focus and the ants and so\nSome of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals in the colony contribute to forwarding ... home you're brought from ants were too jarring Jarvis harvest France from I'm here in California oh it's like for partially on the sidewalk since\n... slightly larger than what they are a little bit longer there but yeah and of course she than the ones you see on the sidewalk and why why are you interested in\nThese areas from the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between ... sites\nSo a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they forward and how quickly they call their friends to food so another thing I brought here as in the cast and asked to flip it over I was on its head oh\nSo it was like that that's a cast of a an an Smith yes you is that like pouring plaster Paris\nIt's exactly fast their players from Home Depot how far does that go down as just the whole life\nExactly fast their players from Home Depot how far does that go down as just the whole length I Know that's just the top part\nAbout six or eight inches long it looks from just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did when ... um which is a type of metal said when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to dig around and it will break like the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I said he was the these there's a lot of fraud so that determines how deep they can go\nThrough so much focus on queen bumble bee is what about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones said the ... the drones don't do too much for the call any itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's an important point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this and there were those really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or what something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumblebees do we how do you make a queen\nFor the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sorts\nShe might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other search trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point uh but we think that there are probably also factors in order to just like there are and honeybees\nAnd bumblebees and people just have to look for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from the audience let's start right or were there on the rights or just go ahead please\nUm my um my mom is\nAllergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to like help heal\nHer when she gets styles that is a great question I'm allergic to be used to\nBack up first or do you work with ... and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies [noise] um that's a really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the\nTerrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were stung by being me to\nUm those a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the victim and the B\nInteract interesting ... requests yeah great question but no longer answer also live in big groups with the queen how worried their lives different from something like a honeybee\nThere's a lot of species and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities in some differences in first of all many of them live underground whereas these will and put their hives and say the same ...\nWhereas bees will and put their hives inside the famed three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example both honeybees in some species advance will relocate from one site to another is so honeybees will go and look for a new nest site and can the way the shape of the\nEntrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ends will also there's a species of ... that will look for\nCertain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places or there's some similarities in some differences\nI think the size of the one thing there is some species that have a colonies that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands and even up to ... million so at least cutter\n... can be I have two million individuals\nAnd Justin aren't for Halloween I Know that you also started his social spider borders social spiders\nSo upset about more than forty thousand species of spider is only about forty species are so our social um\nAnd what happens is they are living groups and the reason we think they leave in living things groups and so that they can capture pray that is larger than them and so they ... do these kind of retreat structure is where they live and they raise their\nOffspring together so what you see behind me as a or a bunch of fame spider moms there actually each one is probably the size of a centimeter a centimeter half so half an inch or so\nI mean just taken with a macro lens and the small individuals or their babies that hatched from their ... um and so they take care of all these babies together what they're standing on is basically a little ... the bill and then they build another Web that's what we call the capture Web\nOf airplane seat sizes could lose all coming up for you to afternoon on all things considered on gay you in our [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the civic arts plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\nThousand Oaks California [noise]\nHow did you sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard\nBut I Am not the only one I can see from the audience statistics about sleep in the United states among other countries aren't great fewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole show bang but he's our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules\nCould there be jeans at work my next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep and how well we recover from last week\nAnd he's found one of these genes in a surprising place nowhere near the brain welcome back to tame appalling associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles [noise]\n'cause\nYou need to get seven hours of sleep at night that's what the usual requirement is yes\nFor um the majority of long term studies that have looked have found that if you get significantly less will significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night then that doesn't work out well for you in time in a lot of trouble yeah\nGet like six if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying\nSomeone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that that\nWell that is that going in all honesty I'm of a six hour crowd myself why do we need to sleep and the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually [laughter] what we do know is that if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first are where we can sort of short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just maybe for the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow\nYour memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do those tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects if you continue daily on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at higher risk for infectious diseases\nAnd it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease\nStroke and diabetes\nI mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nAnd interestingly enough I think God genes are pretty much involved in everything we do ... what does it what\nAbout sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours the quality what what one of the genes do\nWhat we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about James is not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment so I was like the ...\nTalking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role in timing sleep\nOn the time of day you prefer to sleep time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day\nOr sleep most of the night on what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restore the properties of sleep the things about sleep that preserve your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep then improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on\nNow what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep or not in our brains they're not in our heads\nWell they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain they're expressed in the body the gene that I focused on in my most recent study below one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which we have ... so the ... one is what's known as a clot seem\nYou have clocks in every cell in your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as the clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it\nIt has to be an end dodging the timing mechanism like gears I talked to my students about gives on the ... most of them don't lower collectors are [laughter] so I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time it is an output mechanism that allows you to\nHi I have is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time the majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep on for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we've looked primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain\nAnd most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks and the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas and the brain and tell your brain how to sleep more importantly how to recover from sleep loss and what do you mean how to recover\nSo the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your thermostat or the hit on the goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep process these works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day\nIf you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more if you get too much sleep will go on to the other direction the clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature\nIn the evening it says to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes\nThat are like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from now the U.S\nTiming also play a role in your ability to recover from those so when\nYou say the clock is that the the circadian rhythm we've been talking about the circadian\nClock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and it would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours\nQuestion over here you know I had a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an ... [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're speaking of themselves\nSo napping is a is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they win by yourself and that's all I Do have one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles in the afternoon no one can complain you can write at all I mean I Know what I'm doing research [laughter]\nBut you're saying napping is important is the mapping is very important if you're not getting daily sufficiently and most of us to have\nOr have jobs or live in a busy environment may not be getting um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually was about recommended but anything from a half hour to an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much so much that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies\nHowever in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism um especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons\nSometimes between one to three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now oh gosh I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't blame them either exactly right that's why I don't try I understand but that's just me let me go to the questions on his side yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep ah ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the\nDay because yes [laughter] and\nI definitely want that to happen because\nGetting my kids up in the morning before noon is a challenge how does your study affect our decision making and farming our society in that arena\nSo the quickest way to answer your question is that my study doesn't affect that at all", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "19"}
