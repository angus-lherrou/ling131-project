DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nSupplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nYou say in a talk that I I Want to write new DNA what does that mean to you\nActually it's easy to write and you know DNA what's hard is composing it you'd think about it DNA is the code of life it's the product of almost four billion years of evolution\nWe don't know how to compose new DNA we can ride it we can read it we can edited but we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of a complex biological function that didn't exist before [noise]\nSo if you if you ... what is the problem in the composition why can't you compose [noise]\nBecause we don't understand how DNA encodes function remember biology molecular biology is a brand new discipline it's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty three\nSo it's not been understood for but for a very short time\nAnd how DNA goes through all the complicated things of his cell and makes biological molecules in codes the ... the the the structure and function to these biological molecules\nIs a brand new field and we still don't understand those rules\nAre so what you mean then and what what do people mean in ... when you say uh the directed evolution of something what does that process me\nIt's just like breathing it's we've been breeding cats dogs race horses lab rats corn for thousands of years without really manipulating the DNA directly but now\nWithout really manipulating the DNA directly but now that we can synthesize DNA and put it in a test tube I can go direct the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct negotiations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product out of that what's the next step [noise]\nSo you put the DNA into a microbe and they start reading it as if it were their own\nAnd a day and they then take the DNA and create the proteins that the DNA encodes than I as the breeder of molecules so to speak I have to decide who is better than what I started with\nWhich one of those microbes makes a bitter protein and that's called good old fashioned analytical chemistry so hard even take the DNA out of that and feed it back and I do it all over again\nIt's sort of creating life and that so it was a new you're creating a new form of life or you're not [noise]\nWell I I think that's probably exaggerating because life was there for me to work with were using the tools of biology to make new things I'm making new proteins they're not alive but they do do some things inside of cells\nBut you do you need the cell to help you make the protein [noise]\nActually so [noise] you don't have to have this self there's now very powerful systems where you can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test tube with notes\nWe can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test tube with no cells at all\nAnd so uh where do you eventually see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power of biology the power of biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make their ... and\nAnd and pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess waste\n...

whether it be towards chemistry or um math so may not be completely relevant question but I Would like to hear your thoughts on this subject how to identify your kids or younger generations um your skill sets that they can go towards chemistry or science of physics\n[noise] did you know did you know what an early age Dr Arnold that you\nWant to I I I was lucky my father was a nuclear physicist and he always thought the girls to do math just as well as boys could so he never discourage me and I also had four brothers to compete with\nAnd I like being the winner [laughter] so I had a father who encouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know I hear this from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model mentor somebody could even be their parents who kept them are good kept alive or encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\n... or ... and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify any young age who's talented in science\nI think all children are talented and if they love it they will ask questions they will do it I think the most important thing is not to discourage someone ...\nHave a tweet from Sydney who says please ask what she knows about how we instinct is encoded in DNA example dogs urge to bury things\nI Wish I knew but it's clear that many important behaviors are at least partially genetically encoded loyalty in

weren't you in his updated my and my last question and that is are there what tools would you like to see I mean I'll give you while you've got some money now from the Nobel right what kind of tools would you that don't exist would you like to have\nWell I Want to be able to measure important properties rapidly so that I can do this breeding faster I don't have a powerful enough tools to do that\nBut I'm also interested in how do you use AI and machine learning to interpret the results of evolution to make it even faster than it is now\nI noticed on your Ted Talk you said that one of

chemistry and she's a professor of chemical engineering bioengineering and chemistry at Cal Tech\nSeventy five degrees [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow in a time of contentious dues indivisible political races Ken we have better conversations about the issues they get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately our guest is Dr Eugene Chang mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago\nHer newest book is the art of logic in India logical world and um [noise]\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners of funding in and first one Alex's from Chicago hey Ellen neighbor\n[noise] hey Sallie they're either and go ahead so odd\nPreviously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm as a male um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know Alex as\nA black male you know you might be\nDoing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist system that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way um women or being a man who contributes suicide genetic systems unknowingly wasn't necessarily make me\nI'm unable to to identify as a feminist\nUm it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminist system and so I'm being able to see the fact that you know I can still be a male male experiences while existing feminist um and identifying myself in in such a way\nA male male experiences while existing reminisced 'em and identify myself in such a way really changed my mind\nUm and I thought about that that's great thanks for calling us that is great that very heartening\nIs you know as part of the problem was that we don't see how we are there see us\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is\nThat we often spend you know trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed as he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the cool has experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analysis experience\nI have a tweet from James which has to me logical discussions doe requirement he requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect the view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think the logic does not require math but logic is in a way parts of math\nAnd these things have poorest boundaries I mean we've constructed a lot of us official boundaries between subjects the bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me with logic in the real world I'm not saying that\nAnd if mathematics helps me with logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician who knows\nWhat to talk about some from the current events or let's turn out to the oddest topic in current events and that is voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault ticket and it's a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether this should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault\nThere are a number of different logical process as at plagues and tell me what you mean by that\nThat's a whole other on a whole lot of different\nParts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because all of the people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for things and things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence there is a paradox because some people say well we have to presume someone innocence until that until that proved guilty and the thing is that if you have an accuser\nAnd an accused Boston or let's just say the acute ... as a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the mom and the woman both innocent at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nThe woman both innocent at the same time because that causes a contradiction and mathematics and civil Sufi have studied paradoxes for a long time and\nStudied ways to resolve paradoxes\nBy shifting levels are finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look up ... whoa that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time and it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at world and good what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care\nThat so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so having a ... a false accusation\nUm would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but isn't for you to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether your prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or\nPrioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have discussion about that and about the fact that we're somehow prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault over time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo the next problem is a a question of black and white thinking and this happens a lot ... people get into arguments in extremes and so many of our arguments at the moment ton device is because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate and between\nI'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like ... you are making everyone into a rapist or what one that professor lung but set on his book that that we are kept rising just spin the both will crimes ... rape\nAnd that's taking very black and white view of thinking but we're calling all forms of sexual assaults and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale I'm Better off ... the uh as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but ... not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is and stroll puffing arguments where you can take that falls equivalents and then you can declare while using everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying\nOr your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind justify accusing him ... sexual assault\nWhich again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking 'em ... finally\nThat anyone really is taking\nI'm finally um that's the question of knowledge and alternate hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing a little while you have to decide what you'll default position is meant to say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position and I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind\nAnd the thing is that in\nA court case to trial it's very important because we're going to punish somebody badly for something so before we do that we should be very sure that they deserve to be punished whereas in the case of a Supreme Court\nAppointments than what we're doing is we're giving something something very good and important and so we should be very sure that they deserve that very good an important thing\nIn that case one might argue that that that situation could be negated by one bad thing happening whereas in the case of a trial\nBe we should nuke we should not punish somebody if there is some doubts about whether they should be punished which means if there is something something good to offset the showing us about the fact that they are bad\nAnd those are two they sound the same but that's slightly different situations that have a different ... situation [noise]\nCelebrating fifty five years of broadcasting from the University of Nevada Reno this is eighty eight point seven and Ninety One point seven K. U. N. army no Ninety One point five K. N. C. C. L. go it's noon\nNPR and W. B. U. R. I'm Jeremy ... I'm Robyn Young it's here and now another ten day this morning that Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\nWas voted to to a final floor vote tomorrow that could happen as soon as tomorrow morning but senators can change their vote tomorrow so the drama has been will date a key swing Senator Jeff flake voted yes in today's procedural votes says he will vote yes to the nomination tomorrow unless something big changes\nAnd Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no today\nSomething big changes and Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no today so she will again tomorrow telling reporters that Kavanaugh is a good man but not the right man for the court at this time\nAnd right now we're waiting for another key swing senator Maine Republican Susan Collins to make a statement she voted yes to end debate today but may soon say how she actually plans to vote\nTomorrow Collins is going to be speaking on the Senate for momentarily and we will bring that speech to live when it happens but as we wait we're joined in the studio by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg and NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow a welcome to both of you know what are you expecting and the next few minutes [laughter]\nIf I if I had a crystal ball believe me\nI would've said when I was expecting before I this is one of those very dramatic moments because if Susan Collins says that she's going to vote no would Lisa Murkowski\nThen everything is on senator Manchin of West Virginia who's a Democrat in a very red state West Virginia and\nI have no idea whether these three people have been consulting each other the way they did actually up ... up until let's say ... a day or two ago but at the time when we were that all the stuff was going on about was they're going to be\nAny sort of an FBI investigation a mansion Collins Murkowski 'em and flake all were in constant touch with each other\nNow the question is Scott\nWhat do you think's going to happen I think there are a couple indications that that that college is going to vote for Kavanaugh the fact that she she viewed the FBI investigation is very thoroughly\nFor Kavanaugh the fact that she she viewed the FBI investigation is very thorough unlike Democrats who said that it was woefully short and the fact that she just had lunch with Mitch McConnell and McConnell apparently emerged from the lunch saying he felt very confident about how the boats going to go he did not look like a leader suddenly scrambling to get the nomination across the finish line\nWho would you would want to be the meaner Scott just to remind us what's the math here tomorrow I mean what what how you know what happens if there's a time when a limbo changes as we said right now it's fifty one forty nine to nearly ... ... what do we let you got\nYour guy and then it man on the Senate is divided fifty one forty nine Republicans at fifty one seats Democrats have forty nine seats at today's a cloture vote was a party line vote with two exceptions Murkowski hopped to the Democrats to vote no mansion hop to the Republicans to vote yes\nSo if there's one more no votes and there was today and it's fifty fifty then vice president Mike Pence comes and breaks the tie which would certainly be unprecedented for a Supreme Court confirmation vote\nScott as you watch this and the decisions that the senators are making\nIt does appear from the outside that their own futures are in their minds more than anything else perhaps that they're thinking about whether this whether it's Joe mansion or whether it's Susan Collins or or others that they're thinking about what it means for them politically coming up in the midterms\nAbsolutely uh Joe mansion that's the case more than anyone else Joe Manchin is a Democrat running for reelection in West Virginia where President Trump is wildly popular\nHe somebody who supported a Trump's last nominee Neil Gorsuch and uh before before the Ford allegations arose look very likely to vote for judge Kavanaugh mansions in a tough spot and I really don't think he wants to be viewed as the decisive vote but that's where he\nTough spot and I really don't think he wants to be viewed as the decisive vote but that's where he is because if you go if you vote for cabinet if he helps get Kevin on the on the court at the loan Democrat and a decisive vote\nDemocrats will will blast him and and and maybe abandoned him over the next few weeks but if you know then uh then he might lose a lot of support and innovate Oregon President Trump's very popular\nYou guys are looking at pictures outside Susan Collins office\nRight now uh it's packed you know tons of people there and of course that you you will know they've been people in the corridors of the capital you know for the last couple of weeks but huge crowd there now\nI'm just your thought because everybody the same sort of new territory and what happens if the vice president has to break a tie what what's your thinking about Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh heading towards the Supreme Court potentially it sounds like you know most likely\nA tie vote that honor the virus on on the Thai yeah I'm sure that he and Mitch McConnell\nWill think that that is better than losing\n'em and that he will go there and people will forget\nThat it was a tie vote or that the vice president broke the tie on and I I don't actually think that that it may be significant in some historical sense but given the number of rules that have been changed or broken in the last\nTwo years to get through first Neil Gorsuch when I'm Republican leader McConnell a lead the fight and it wasn't much of a fight because they had the votes to get rid of the filibuster rules so that\nYou could confirm somebody with a simple majority instead of needing sixty votes so that was the first one then\nNeeding sixty votes so that was the first one then there were all the rules that were broken or ... or\nLong term a customs of consulting senators from states over a lower court judge ships and the Trump White house stopped doing that in many cases and then there were all the rules about the number of people who could be considered at one time that used to be one or two\nAt most in a single hearing now is you know a half dozen two dozen sometimes so when it comes to judge ships\nThe Republicans who have had locked down control of this process have changed a lot of rules just having the vice president cast\nThe deciding vote I I think would not rank high among them\nWas actually going to ask someone who's seen as a partisan a you know that that a tie had to be broken but also that you have a retired chief justice Stevens come out and say he was against him or you have you know he's someone who I\nThink you tell me I'm like recent nominees actually worked in the political realm in the Bush White House ah was accused of handling other controversial nominations of judges William prior and Charles Pickering and saying he wasn't involved in an email showed he was involved\nI'm going to have to ask you to hold that thought because I think\nWe do know is man sergeant armed forces stand until this [noise] ... order and
