Oaks California\nLater in the hour an update on where world nation stand on curbing carbon emissions and avoiding it climate catastrophe but first\nThursday morning two astronauts on route to the international space station had to abort their launch after a booster rocket malfunctioned\nThe made an emergency dissent back to earth and are happy to report both are doing well both landing safely Rachel Feldman science editor of popular science issue to bring us up to date on the launch and other select Detroit subjects in Science Welcome back right Joe\nThanks for having me Ira anything more about what went wrong there yeah so we know that about two minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure and they\nTwo minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure and they had to undergo what's known as a a ballistic landing a ballistic descent which is so called because\nUsually they add make kind of um [noise] a shallow angle as they come down to create a little bit of left and take away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rocket is really coming down more like a projectile and this has happened before but only ever um during landings which of course appears a lot less dramatic because uh they were supposed to come back down to the ground and the first place\nSo this is the first time they've ever had to make a such an aborted landing during a launch and um the Russian space agencies that immediately they would begin investigating and uh so far that that's all we know\nOne of the good news about it is that it worked right [laughter] right [laughter] right and again this is a rare but the kind of things that astronauts\nTrain for all the time it's not something that happens a lot but certainly one of the procedures that they are expected to uh occasionally encounter so you know not something we want to have happen but something that is certainly on the roster of things they have learned how to handle\nWere were ... with the Soyuz capsule being the only way for humans to reach the international space station isn't this now or you know a little bit of a problem is no other way to get up\nRight so there are um I Believe three so use missions planned that are now kind of up in the air because the Russian space agency again is undertaking this investigation and so it's possible some of those\nIs undertaking this investigation\nAnd so it's possible some of those will be put on hold and even if they're not uh you know those two crew members who were counted on who are now on the ground instead of on I assess a minute there's there's probably going to be a gap in staffing you know we have three people on the space station right now\nBut they're scheduled to come back in December now they could extend their stay a bit but the Soviets capsule they have up there that's going to bring them home\nI Believe it's only I can only stay up there through some time in January so\nUh that's the longest there'll be able to say before coming back down and that means that the space station probably will be an crude for some amount of time which is something that we know should be possible there are procedures in place for it but I don't believe it's ever happened before\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow\nThere is less than a month until the mid term elections on November sects\nAnd there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security the federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated\nYet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference well it showed how hackers could break into voting machines so what are the real risk\nTake into voting machines so what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure happen we security systems how does all of this affect voting behavior\nAnd our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for seven to four to five five\nEight four for ... you can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these terms\nLet me bring on my guests Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday\nThanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\n... and it's nice to have you um Larry I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know in tire Lee what they were trying to do for first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election and two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned out one of these\nAttacks on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchased a political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things or if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself or we saw them\nFor focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nA we saw them targeting a voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there and um and and of course voter registration databases are the rules that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which uh manufacturers e pull books was attacked but I think\nUm we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm\nLooking around on their part\nWas that was that the vendor company that was putting the see anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off [noise] is that what you're talking about in that case or is it something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there is a company the our systems my actually I think they may still [laughter] they may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them\nI'm ... and again they manufacture IPO books and and deal with registration databases\nUm electronic publics or what you can kind of what our use their off in a a tablets or or ... or or computers that are used to check people in\n'em and uh uh as I said I laughed I checked I think they have they they moved in either direction we successfully breach but at least in one of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was\nSome dinner and it sounded like them or that that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromised\n[noise] well um [noise] ah well that's actually quite a controversial\nQuestion if you ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped um I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um\nYou know perhaps to influence the elections ranging from um affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems um in the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which I'm wary was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states\nUm they got attacked those are voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um\nOr potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to the death con um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nThat um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine and do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly um that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated\nOn um either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access that in order to have a actually ineffective attack on them um and you would need some sort of inside job\nUm that would require 'em a lot of attention to particular machines and would it be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing is it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against on the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials to\n... hour they right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is\nI'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities and are taking 'em um are are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that\nUm the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't have any sort of paper record of the election being there in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that\nThey're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we're doing\nThat um there were mistakes made\nBut a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could I think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify\nThat the machines weren't monkey with and there were mistakes and the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking that the machines right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken care of\nAnd are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see it\nThe Eighteen are well taken care of and are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see a DEF CON but it would but who it would be good for the state's the move and directions to make it easier to demonstrate the skeptics that that was\nI I if I could just jump in real ... point um [noise] I I\nI I think there to to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but I'm more importantly there's there there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and an example of that my an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nUm and that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly um that comes up on on websites and gets report it out and uh uh we we have seen in fact not in the United states\nOr that I Know of but in other countries ... election reporting attacked um and um if if you get ... incorrect numbers there in in the environment that we have today the hyper partisan environment where there is\nUm a lot of false information put out on social media ... I was talking earlier about that level of interference from the Russians and the two thousand sixteen election casting doubt on election outcomes if you don't have as a as we don't in in in a Thirteen states at least in in some polling places and Thirteen states\nA paperback up that you can go back to afterwards and say\nYeah maybe there's been out cast on these elections but we can go back and we have something that is independent of the software to tell us the results\nAnd much more friday November sixteenth details that chemistry of the cocktail dot org [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen\nHundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as\nRising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and and more powerful storms and to ensure that we don't get too close to ...\nStorms and to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point the agreement to ask countries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius but how much does happen to Greece save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the IPC see this week cash shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report\nAnd tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years is that to Kelly the Vin she is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much to be with you\nI Want to send out a shout out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel toward a one and a half degree increase in global temperature are you worried are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to four to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at ... fry 'em so back to live in the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nThat even a one point five degree increase is gonna bring some pretty big changes\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right said that um how's it going to actually has these two ...\nThat's absolutely right so the Paris Agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue at first for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and that was because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder is it to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\n'em and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nAnd for example [noise]\nSo for example on what they found is they look across a number of different systems and they found a for example for extreme heat the percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming on at least once every five years is two and a half times worse\nWith two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer um when you don't have any ice on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that could impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and while that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to ... million\nOne point five degrees and while that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people\nBeing impacted a species losses um two times worse for both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects\nI'm almost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of the further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous\nYou know does it look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the bad to point zero degrees\nSo what the report finds is that both um two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible um there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um\nTo make that transition happened on right now a emissions are roughly fifty to get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide\nPer year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century so this is a tremendous transformation and the combination rates that are truly\nTremendous transformation and department is Asian rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity\nOr to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand\nIncreasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nUm a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them we need\nA you know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can you can you answer at least who commissioned do what they do they use [noise]\nThe way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists\nAnd had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assessed all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius\nAnd see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case on there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea um about a week ago and that all of the government\nPond in Korea um about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators come make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policy makers so in this case\nI'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually indoors this report [noise] Mm\n[noise] oh we're a lot of people want to talk about it I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice [noise]\nYes hello so\nSo I'm an agriculture and I think what ends up\nConfusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it\nWhat really hurts us in our culture is the high temperature the record highs so for example in the mid West is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to view or in the Central Valley of ... of California when tomatoes\nWhen the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this is really critical of the er the highs not just the average temperatures and and I could fix this by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north America for a screw back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the ... atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had all the little ice age and I wish more of the scientists will talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel ...\nOther things like that that will instill make us grow more\nPlants and we can have them for food feed him till I play you are you a former [noise]\nNo I'm a researcher actually but I have a small farm and I'm the developer the energy to Burke which makes food for food feeding fuel all and the same maker and it uses little water and nitrogen and you know everybody thinks we're going to have some input Seattle to an atmosphere where all the plants will take it up if we switched to the renewables using plants\n... let me get a comment thanks thanks for your call\nPlants ... let me get a comment thanks for your call what about the kennel we saw some of the CEO to reverse some of the\nThings on ... some really good points here I think first on as um as you mentioned the one point five degree goal is for global average temperature increase so temperature increase at any one location especially on

discovery and that was that below the sea floor it's mangroves Pete and the Pete which is resulting from feel of a rise a\nIt preserved within posts and now we've mapped over four thousand we actually map four thousand I'm forty two wouldn't post and other architectural elements\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow in May of Nineteen fifty nine a small squirrel monkey from the jungles of Peru sat atop an American Jupiter rocket waiting her blast off into space\nMiss Baker was her name and after nine minutes of weightlessness she fell back to earth where she became an instant celebrity inundated with Leathers letters from school children and even then mobbed at a press conference as\nOne of the first two American Animals successfully launched into and return from space miss bakers flight was a study and how we humans might fare\nIn orbit in space but there's a lot to learn by studying these small cousins of ours right here on earth analyzing their communications the structures of their societies and the brainy wave that they navigate their world\nAs my next guest says the neatest stone assistant professor of biology at California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks welcome to science friday I think it's great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey for my childhood\nAs one of the first animals that went into space wow what what can you fascinated with study scores so\nI'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I Want it to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nResearch and I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in so off I went to um Amazon in Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season but the more time I spent there the more I became fascinated with all kinds of questions about them\nAnd I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild [noise]\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [noise] um but yeah that's how it all started wow I'm\nA big show how many do you study how many of the group a number of your study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor to a sweet groups regularly\nAnd do you do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them\nSome square one of the challenges of working with ... monkeys is that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active so it's not that easy to individually identify them I'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant\nOut you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out okay give me a typical day in the life of a squirrel monkey [noise]\nOkay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree and uh they spend a lot of time active uh all day they they're nonstop\nOr they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time forging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day\nWhen it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven ...\nFor their ... yeah or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd a with a head up and then they bite off the head\nKind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes and they seem very happy while they're doing it\nWow [laughter] and I understand and an artist\nAnd to attack a ... a ... [noise] wait why don't why haven't they do that\nYeah so I've only seen adults do it but I actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nest that Hank pretty low\nAnd once the adult lost desert the nest the adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that ... left abandoned in the nest\nWow so they're pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient inpatient [laughter] it was once we're not leaving so far right yeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's\nOf ... of of the other one of the spider monkey let's let's hear that clip\n[noise] I\n... I said spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah okay tell us when we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls\nI'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own um I reckon\nAnd there you can you recognize their own um I can recognize\nYes um the the the sender and the receiver um but when there is you know ten of them in a tree it's kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\n... we have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that that's so sad that we hear is that rises there there's usually this is those squirrel monkeys and we're listening to\nMy ... ... it might be birds actually because square monkeys sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest right um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of square monkeys instead of bird\nHow hard was it how much time has it taken you to know the difference and to study this sounds they make\nIt's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys um\nTeen years I'm from being with the monkeys um you just get used to it um it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey whisper and he knows everything about square monkey then so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nHow long have you been doing it for a little longer\nHe started with with ah a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing it for about Twenty years\nThe monkey whisper yeah well do you call him a yes sometimes be busy like it he loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about the human language for evolution of our language from from studying them the squirrel monkey\nYeah so um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming hypothesis\nAnd um the idea here is that you can try to understand the evolution of human language so the idea that humans started living in social groups that we're increasingly large and so manual grooming sort of the the kind we seen bad dunes andme attacks\nBecame less less feasible really and so the ideas that humans would have invented an alternative form of grooming vocal grooming so it would be a way to maintain contact and social bonds with their their friends\nUm and that would leave the hands also free for other tasks um and the ideas that that is\nOther tasks um and the idea is that that eventually would have evolved into human language now square monkeys for living in groups so group so large they're actually\nPretty a social they don't grooms we expect primates all to do that but they don't actually groom each other they to live in social groups that are large um they don't groom and they talk all the time they're constantly chattering there it's nonstop sound when they're forging when they're traveling\nCertainly hope you enjoy and of course don't forget to take us with you it eight point seven Ninety One point seven day you went on [noise]\n\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow you know every year salmon and go on the most important journey of their lives after living years in the wild\nWild oceans they must win back to the coast to one very particular river mouth and then ... miles of tributaries branches upstream until they finally finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this and well like in\nAny good trip yeah you need a map and not just a compass that's just telling you wearing north is also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight nor does in more north east east than south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded\nThat what did they had long suspected that Pacific salmon can detect the magnetic field lines of the year their map is they're magnetic\nKind of the your beer map is they're magnetic and what about their Olympic willing cousins and when you look fishy living quiet landlocked lines you know lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nHere to explain Moore's Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me you know I just I just said about but\nSalmon living impressive lives right they travel all that way how many miles do their journeys take\nThat is pretty impressive and their journeys can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds\n... and then they usually actually these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct and they don't just have to navigate upstream may have to find the right stream to go how does he do this they they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in\nThis size than have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reached streams uh they generally would use their sense of smell\nBut in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something more broad scale and in this term we think they're using magnetic maps and they make information\n... now I Know that your research is looking at a different group of salmon the Atlantic salmon what what makes them so interesting to you\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants\nOf individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake\nMaine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery\nTransferred from a landlocked lake in Maine\nTo a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat thin outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of hatchery\n... and ... and yet you round but they still have the Jew magnetic maps in them that they would have needed that they knocked ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these and why\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use in different aspects of the magnetic field especially for maps and so the earth's magnetic\nField has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field or also known as magnetic field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator\nAnother aspect of the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth and so they're steeper toward the polls and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict or favorably\nAre predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSo it's super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel so they form a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them\nSo they're the mechanisms behind lag NATO reception are are still unclear but it's\nOf the leading hypotheses is that a salmon and other species have tiny chains of\nIt's one of the leading hypotheses is that\nA salmon and other species have tiny chains of magna tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic properties\n... and so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that these chains can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields\nAnd so changes in both the field strings and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials\nSo these structures are thought to be found in the nose and also the latter alliance all along the sides of the body of a fish but the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nMhm now why why is it important to you why why does it matter that they can still detect these\nFew\nWell it's a rather interesting question that we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that\nCould go to the ocean retain a map sense just to a point of curiosity\nAnd we also wanted to know um if it lent examine\nAlso possesses ability it's another group of individuals that does ethnic maps of diverse ... know amounts of species but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic\nEnvironments one can they even detect the magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how do they actually respond\nMhm and so how did you go about testing research\nThe eggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were rewritten subsequently tested\nAnd so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coils and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire\nAnd when you touch copper wires to an electrical\nIt's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire and when you attach copper wires to an electrical power supply and crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nElectricity is a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that allows us to\nAlter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\nMhm so what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know in grade school of if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnifies the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to the Fisher you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nIf that were present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains\nOf NATO tight right that right somehow connect with an herself right and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement fish movement by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nSo what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos of our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fish is head relative to magnetic north\nWow\nThat's terrific guy and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nSo I mean you know how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scale the night with those maps is yeah\nSo what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nSo we have a whole number of experiments that we have talked about over the years but one of the experiments would be to actually look at night and magnetic resolution of this map so having a theory that points moving them closer and closer together and to see how finer core scale their responses actually are\nSo uh could could you save endangered salmon man by knowing some more about them\nI mean it always helps to know more information about us bases that you're trying to conserve them knowing how they're making movement decisions would certainly be helpful and probably a tool and Sam and conservation but certainly not the only thing\nThat we can ... them yeah well good luck to you and your future experiments All right thank you very much
