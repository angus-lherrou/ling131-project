thousand and Thirteen I just find it's interesting so you did a cool show on Comedy Central which has show built around\nObviously we know this is a character driven show but I ... in the comedy world there were a lot of people doing characters everyone was really doing a lot of self reverential comedy\nIt was really doing a lot of self reverential comedy talking stories from their lives I mean in a way that just seem like much easier than doing character not if you don't want to share who you really are\nWith an auto [laughter] never be able to keep those walls [laughter]\nBut I'm just wondering when you were pitching this I assume Comedy Central was like what do you have and you're like I Want to do this character driven show yes we're the great this is different nobody's doing\nAll right they were they were actually very cool I had done a bunch of sketches on line and we'd put out like a Bobby bottle service and breathe\n\nAnd ... the early ...

response that it deserves a\nAnd it was sort of become a backdoor pilot four of the cruel show I we were very specifically wanted to do character driven comedy I think I've always been drawn to people are trying to make people I don't like in real life somehow sympathetic mhm\nAnd I don't know what that says about\n... uh my uh inner world\n[laughter]\nSo the character that you in general any play
