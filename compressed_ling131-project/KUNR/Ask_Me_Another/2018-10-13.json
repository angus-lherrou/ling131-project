diplomat\nThat's really hard\nTo [noise] on so then you know and then I was like okay you know what I'm going to figure it out maybe law school who knows um and then yeah and then I kept on trying different things until I got here\nAnd did you did you take a acting classes or did you just start auditioning like how how you transition happened well I went to performance\nArt high school right on when I was a kid I when I was in high school and so I was very familiar with the arts and I really loved it when I left college I started taking acting classes so I just\nThe college I started taking

ensemble cast where everyone supposedly liked each other\nUh what is the secret ingredient this\nJust be around women [laughter]\nHave every wouldn't be a woman [laughter] [noise]\nI you know from experience that it's a really great environment you know it's so funny 'cause people like would assume like the opposite ... you know how they brainwashed us in the past like catty women riding\nHis you know the scale is the competition yeah yeah I mean I feel like I mean you can find that anywhere really but I think I mean I always have found myself very comfortable and groups of women and and spaces where it's like female run I mean I went to an all women's college\nBut this was definitely a progressive group and uh everyone really love being there and everybody was really excited to make something that was unlike any other\nYeah and you know what I find very impressive and particularly admirable about you is that you are one hundred percent self made because growing up your parents and your brother were deported when you were just fourteen years old and you were forced to basically fend for yourself\nUh-huh how did you manage [noise] um so I think I had a very\nClear I'm at a very young age that if that did happen I mean I did grow up with the fear of my family being separated that was always very present in our house\nFreighted that was always very present 'em in our household and so I was just always sort of like an outsider look looking in you know actually because I was the only one in the family who was documented who was a citizen so anyway I grew up very confused but\nI always had a um very clear in my mind that whatever happened that I was going to continue going and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and and that didn't mean I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed\nIn life I guess I just wanted to figure out a way to be happy and to um you know a figure all everything out and hopefully along the way help my family one day\nAnd in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother your brother your parents deportation ha what was it about two thousand fourteen uh that you decided it is now time for me to tell the story um luckily I\nThought maybe my voice could be an asset\nYou're hot [laughter] I'm way because especially because of the people the people who are I was hearing like on the news um and on different talk shows really didn't when they talked about immigration it really didn't seem personal to me so I figured well how are these people representing my experience and the experience of millions\nUm I Know what this feels like I Know what family separation is so it's not really that easy it's not that we need to have that our conversations about this and then I I decided okay I'll write something and see\nAnd I I decided okay I'll write something and see if you move the needle in any way and what was the aftermath once that was published\nWho was it was like cats at a bag and they had to do all this work\n[laughter]\nSo I'm like I'm so tired I'm like oh you're struggling in Hollywood and like nobody wants to give me a job [laughter] you know unless it was you know some drug dealers girlfriend on [noise] and and here I Am putting myself in his\nVision now do all this work on top of this\nWork yeah and it also led to obviously you deciding to write a book a whole memoir based on your life yeah called in the country we love my

up to me all the time it's\nLike five to your book I read it in one sitting it's easier in\nYeah I I uh I gave her younger students [laughter] during the students have been responding to the story so I wrote it for them really it wasn't intended for you an adult [noise] so yeah that's why you found it easy\n[laughter] and now this memoir your story is being developed as a television series\nWell
