... okay\nSo let me start with you uh and and ah in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a Tracey Samuelson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report as it deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts of it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the boost to a capital expenditure is was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the ... and we're seeing a slow down and so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headline number was good consumers seem happy\nNew and it occurs me actually just thinking back to how I open the show that I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the un stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's plan it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which in the stimulus feeds into and stronger grass and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact both low the\nFed target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read and so\nTarget rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now um things are looking good economically speaking in its good as Katherine side because the consumer is good I I hear some trepidation do in your voice mail\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three persisting concerns\nSlower global growth higher interest rates and ... concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and so you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead okay\nKatherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears amazing point them out well well uh [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing just on the street and tariffs when he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to billions of dollars into the United states because of all these are not mentioning the consumer is going to pay those jobs but then he turns around in an interview with the wall Street Journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nAnd in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists have been so like basically in the same breath ah you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he signed the terrorists don't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then\nIs inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know when I've talked with a business groups when I've talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact\nThat Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nNew on other running from the wall Street Journal interview and and ah one has to say it's the goal is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed uttered budget power or his biggest economic problem\nI'm even as a German ... told me back in June even as the fed doesn't bring attention with President says one does wonder if\nYou know with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer um and the fed might be thinking about rage what does this kind of pressure you suppose due to the motive ... well\nYou know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what the fed is really concerned about is how to keep the economic\nBull market running how to keep economic growth in and stop lung still normalizing policy because women as and we know that it will be aware and eventually the neck in recession hits he wants to make sure that he has to look at is this fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown as possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession and they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and so that's what's happening here very moderate in ...\nAnd so that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero rain so\nAlong that path any political ... political ... of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart his job all the more tricky and that sweat and has to be negotiated going for a port\nRichardson a at a Edward Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York City Thanks you too thank you ... have a nice weekend on Wall street today down day to end it up and down weak and let me say one more time I think\nLike the fourth time this week I've said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up\nThey go down but it has been a while since things have felt this chopping right well that the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\n\n\n\nAll right\nBack we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that is Catherine and Neal and I were saying it's pretty good number credit where credit's due\nBut you dig a little deeper as we want to do around here and you could start to separate what is boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping growth all that much at all one of those drags last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there so how much\nFaster with the economy have grown without this drag from trade you would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent at the end of you know it's cheap\nCloser to over five percent at the end of you know is chief us economist at essence ... global what you saw was exports down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shaped nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth but he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays\nThey may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from Tempe present to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter to spend now and have it ready to sell rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings Matt McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which analyzed transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has a ... for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated the Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher steel prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers that the impact starting to bite\nAt least at the country and company level consumers just aren't feeling it yet a majority responding to a recent marketplace Edison research pull fifty to present the parents have no impact on them

server but you know when you need long term archival storage you want something separate it from the Internet\nAnd you want something that's going to uphold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in and the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because it's cheap it's good it's it's reliable and its stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah Gen cheapest important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah ... terabytes is equivalent to about a million books I'm right now a a single L T o seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes that's about Fifteen million books on one tape on one card\nGosh okay now there was a corporate store you're right there's it's Sony and Fuji film or the makers of this tape that everybody now uses and we'll be using for awhile and there's sort of at loggerheads here explain what's going on\nSo there's a basic standardized technology
