taxing Chinese imports this year\nUnder the WTO rules the United states is not allowed to unilaterally just ratchet up the tariffs on China\nGame theory suggests a couple of things one is it's hard to

and the United states now that unfortunately has to be coupled with a similar willingness to negotiate on China's buck\nOr outside parties say other countries of the WTO could bring the U.S and China together and create space for trust to Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law they could say listen here's a new trade agreement that takes away tariffs provides new customers for your exports and outside third parties will be the free trade police\nTo it's giving a little bit of political cover to China to say we need to make these reforms in order to remain a member in good standing at the WTO we
