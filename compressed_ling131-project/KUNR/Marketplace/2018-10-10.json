actually own about a hundred properties and tried to give them even though of course in her says the banks thought it did\nWith the rest and CSP started by trying to find homeowners to see if they want it to stay for about ten percent of the properties it gave the homeowner at their house\nWe weren't giving them a hundred thousand dollar homes were during their homes that were worth about twenty thousand\nAbsent a homeowner MCAST would foreclose on the property and try and find a local nonprofit or municipalities to help fix it up or tear it down\nA hundred and twenty five properties

time new technology has disrupted the street you can barely hear the [noise]\nThe whiz by the outcry over each scooters has been allowed I'm throwing voted against it Findlay suicide that every time they come on the sidewalk I have to war over\nJust a sampling of opinions from Alberto and Denise mood and in the beach signed city of Santa Monica recently officials agreed to allow as many as two thousand scooters on their streets to cities struggle to deal with this addition to the urban landscape\nThe horror stories and the anger hasn't let up there's even Instagram account of people destroying the scooters running them over with cars dropping them off tall buildings it's got intense\nHistorian Peter Norton says he's seen it before it's a new version of an old problem no one is a professor at the University of Virginia and he wrote a book about what happened when another new innovation the automobile arrived on city streets\nThe predominant reaction among most people was we have to restrict these crazy drivers and their machines\nSee before cars came along our streets were really different they were full of people walking plane biking riding horses pushing carts getting on and off street cars and they were all jostling for the scene space in a kind of chaotic ballet\nCars came along they're big they're fast they're made of metal and we're killing people by the thousands\nThey're made of metal and we're killing people by the thousands more autos rather last more I knew that the day was filled with grizzly story crashes and cartoons of evil driver depicted grim reaper\nZ but then things changed car proponents campaigned to shift the conversation from deadly drivers to careless pedestrians it was the beginning of Jay walking\nJay in old thing was a foolish person from the country we would call them a hit gets an offensive term\nThe aim was to shame pedestrians for walking into the streets which the automobile backers wanting cars to own one of the first cities to make Jay walking a\nCrime was Los Angeles by the Nineteen twenties the fast growing city had one of the highest car ownership rates in the country and drivers wielded their influence through the powerful auto club yeah the same when you called a job your car battery\nRepresented the motorists and wanted to make sure that the streets were safe and that everyone knew what to do\nMatthew ... is the group's historian he says the club did much more than ... laws to discourage Jay walking\nEverything from side to landmarks to traffic signals all of these common sense rules\nHow to be derived and then disseminated and then in force\nThe auto club worked hand in hand with the city to do that and turn the street in front of their historic headquarters south of downtown into kind of testing ground for new ideas like what is the first traffic signals\nYou don't have a concrete base Senate Rosa fourteen feet with signals to go or stop\nStanding that intersection today you can see the legacy those\nStanding at that intersection today can see the ... that was efforts street that is much more order than the old days but also more dominated by cars Norton the historian says that may not last\nThe victory of automobiles in the Nineteen twenties is proof that what streets are for can be changed\nInnovation he says he's a powerful force\nThe popularity of scooter ring is actually I think pretty good evidence that people are looking for something different and if we in two thousand Eighteen take the same kind of approach\nA reexamining our laws are social norms and our infrastructure we can reinvent streets again and there's no reason why we shouldn't\nLike it or not he scooters could someday become just another part of our streets gate

than three percent today\nBut about which there are two things to say first of all markets go down as well as up especially after they had been going up so far so quickly that is an important point and completely normal number two\nThere are a lot of reasons why this is happening chief probably among them to quickly rising yields that his interest rates in the bond market that we have been telling you about the last ten days or so and concurrent ... about inflation all of the above I have to say again\nOur normal but admittedly off putting when interest rates have been so low for so long and markets have mostly gone up\nWhat is interesting though is that what's been going on in this economy is financial markets is affecting the rest of the world case in point treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and the Chinese currency today in an interview this morning\nBut it was more than Beijing against what he called competitive devaluation of the UN that's the Chinese currency that is China trying to get a global trade edge by making its currency and therefore his goods cheaper for others to buy think trade war and terrorists here and we should point out that the ...\nI think trade war and terrorists here and we should point out that the UN is about ten percent cheaper today than it was last spring but his marketplaces Tracey Samuelson reports that might have more to do with what's going on here than what the Chinese are doing\nThe one has been losing value against the dollar but you know what it's had lots of friends on that journey\nThe dollar is strong if the euro and the and the Canadian dollar in Norway Sweden and almost all the crunch of the world\nAre Chandler is the chief market strategist at ...\nI don't think I Need to separate like explanatory framework to explain China\nYes China's economy isn't growing as fast as it once was and\nThere's concern about to have you got Bernard they've been taken out by local governments in banks lots of bad loans\nSo that's definitely a part of the lawns depreciation but mostly everyone along at all or Steve hanky at Johns Hopkins university says if anything the Chinese have tried to keep the value of the one from falling further they're not working to make it cheaper\nThey haven't done anything any differently than they've been doing for a long on\nThe dollar is like this glowing orbit drawing people in things to a strong US Economy and rising interest rates better tempting investors with higher returns but as the files it does have this effect that the Trump Administration doesn't love you swap presided as a trade policy professor at Cornell\nSo but added measures that the Trump Administration has pulled on imports from China now are much less bulletin in other words uh been persons that if on Chinese imports doesn't amount to much if the Chinese currency depletion is by almost an identical alone\nBecause that things minutiae and was trying to warn China not to get any ideas about using its currency as a weapon in the country's ongoing trade war chains visuals\nAs a weapon and the country's ongoing trade war Chinese officials said yesterday they have no intention of devaluing their currency I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nWhile the treasury structure and the foreign exchange markets and terrorists in the trade war get all the headlines there is another way the United states interact with the global economy that's at least as significant and it fits under the general heading of regulatory review the White House said this morning and this has bipartisan backing in Congress that should be said but the White House\nAnnounced that the committee on foreign investment in the United states ... as it's called is going to start taking you're much closer look at\nForeign investment in the United states ... that one\nThe new rules are meant to protect our national security they'll apply when a foreign firmer individual tries to invest in certain sensitive areas such as technology everything from aircraft parts makers to a I to semi conductor makers read lots of Chinese companies\nBut also other kinds of companies says Gregory who says he and a partner at law firm fully in large\nFinancial institutions insurance company's money transmitting companies that are they're all going to have a more probing scrutiny of their sales\nHe's phones will now have to alert syfy us about any potential foreign investment or face civil penalties the agency will have to sift through thousands of additional filings a lot more work when it's already lacking some say enough resources to get its job done more work to for foreign companies that want to invest here\nTony Fratto is a former Bush administration official now at consulting firm Hamilton place strategies he says the tightening up an additional powers for ... could have a chilling effect\nI Do think that maybe they're charge has gone too far Fratto says foreign investment\nDo you think that maybe they're charge has gone too far\n... says foreign investment dollars could be redirected to Europe or Asia\nAnd those investment dollars go other place than we are we are actually strengthening our competitors in some cases our national security or photos\nWhich would defeat the purpose of these new stricter regulations in New York I'm Janet Babin for marketplace\nWall Street today as I said not so good also remember I mentioned people are starting to get worried about inflation we get numbers on prices at the consumer level it's called the consumer price index technically tomorrow morning so there is that to look forward to stopped way down on this Wednesday will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\nOne of the few things that Republican and democratic political professionals agree on is that the mid term elections twenty seven days hence are going to turn on turn out and in the weeks left no small fraction of the record amounts that are going to be raised and spent on this election is going to be directed from we at getting out the vote with one especially elusive group\nIn mind marketplaces Kimberly Adams has that one\nTimes a week a couple of dozen volunteers gather at the historic woman national democratic club in Washington DC they said it along you shaped table and do their part to get out the vote volunteered more this mid term even that I have and any other election on the day I visit Nicole ...\nAnd then I have and any other election on the day I visit\nNicole ... is handwriting postcards to potential voters yes handwriting postcards that have the outline of the state of Virginia which is just across\nThe river their fellow Democrat we need your vote to flip the fifth on November say this election is so important in your voice is more important\nThat fellow Democrats name and address may well have come from a list of likely voters people who have voted before lots of get out the vote money is aimed at getting those voters to show up on election day\nBut that money could be better spent elsewhere says Clarissa Martinez she's vice president of need us us a nonprofit that focuses on boosting Latino political engagement\nSo what do you see is that the vast majority of resources actually chases highly have vigil voters first and foremost\nWhen what you really need to do says Martinez is bringing new voters\nFor young voters and for communities like the Latino community they simply don't end up making that outraged target of many of those campaigns\nAnd that neglect shows up at the polls only twenty percent of those Eighteen to twenty nine years old voted in the last midterm in twenty four team which is one reason social media is full of ads like this one from knocked the vote where aging baby boomers mock younger voters\nIf the weather is nice maybe you can go to one of those little marches you might even share this video on Facebook or ... or\nWell actually they might\n... because well actually they might and not just because many races are so tied political parties can't afford to ignore younger voters but because this time around\nMany young voters refused to be ignored\n[noise] both of them

Cornell in two thousand five Sears merged with Kmart the plan was to reinvent the two struggling retail chains and Allen says that takes a lot of money\nYou need to invest money in the stores and marketing and people bought the two companies weren't generating sufficient cash\nOver the years management focused on cutting costs Sears closed thousands of stores and sold off popular brands like

be recognized according to the ratings people at Nielsen who looked at digital and physical album sales as well as streaming numbers hip hop and R and be replaced rock as this country's most popular music genres\nBut as often happens there is a twist because what Nielsen didn't consider\nHow much money people spend on concerts and when it comes to live shows rock and roll is still the king rock concerts accounted for more than half of the five billion dollars generated by last year's highest grossing life towards new show wrote about rock in revenue for the wall Street Journal welcome to the program\nThanks for having me when was the last time you were in Iraq I was a properly pretty recently I went to a show at the Warsaw to see a band called all ways\nAlong with snail mail and hatch e okay so it was a surprise nobody listening to this program that I don't know any of those bands but but but it gets to the point of\nUm uh that's where the money is really right hip hop and R B have been dominant culturally for many years now commercially speaking rap is really taking over the industry over the last couple of years so\nTaken over the industry over the last couple of years so there tends to be this huge focus rightly so on rap and it's important right now but the thing is\nA huge part of the music industry is the other side of the industry not just in the recording music side but to live side and something that's kind of been\nKind of obscured lately is how significant rock still is for live music is it just because rock and roll has been around so much longer than than rap and hip hop and all the rest there are several reasons rock also crosses generations in a way that rap doesn't at a rock concert you could have a younger\nA millennial agenda the music fan who's curious about a particular act and then of course you're gonna get twenty somethings thirty something's forty somethings fifty some things\nBut it's it's more complicated than that guns and roses and older act in eighty nine guns ... roses is playing stadiums and it's playing arenas public enemy and WMA also from ... to\nOr not so one one significant things some of the classic legacy pioneering rap acts aren't playing big venues\nAre a lot of questions actually come out of that the first thing is I'm going to a live show is is a disposable income kind of thing right do rock and roll show fans tend to have more disposable income than the folks who would go to see say and the way\nIt is the case that the younger fans of hip hop have less disposable rash so what happens is the economics for an act like juice world who's on top of their charts with this song lucid dreams right now\nAre different ... if you had this lengthy sprawling tour hitting a second tier dirtier a cities across the u._s.\nA second tier dirtier US cities across the U.S it's not going to work because there aren't enough people to come to that show where they may be a rock act who has older fans with more cash in their pocket\nCan make the economics work um [noise] so let's go back even farther eventually Mick Jagger is going to die for a ... and eventually rock and roll fans now were fifty and sixty and remembering it from these are going to stop going is that going to change the dynamic\nMany people I've talked to feel like this is an elephant in the room for the live music industry and\nUm once the Rolling Stones know Paul McCartney is go it is a question ... acts replace the older acts and can the newer acts in their old age\nGender ... the kind of money that just don't you remember the Rolling Stones back in the seventies they didn't make that much money from albums and even lived they make more money now than than they ever did back in the day too with the question is is that a historical anomaly chai tied to rock in the twentieth century\nOr not and one way that the industry is shifting is facing a little bit more focused on festivals and on smaller venue
