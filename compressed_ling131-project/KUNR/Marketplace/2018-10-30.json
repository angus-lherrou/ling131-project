California voters a week from tomorrow\nWas marketplace Jed Kim reports now from the streets of LA changes in what kinds of cars are on the road\nCould make the gas tax difference\nAnd what kinds of cars are on the road could make the gas tax difference\nElaine Lippmann has brought me to the corner of Venice in Figaro in downtown LA\nIt's next to the convention center staple center and\nAnd here the noises coming through um [noise]\nLet me is with the transportation organization called who is LA\nHe's against proposition six because he says the gas tax is necessary points out the ... in the paper\nLipman says the state has a backlog of a hundred and thirty billion dollars in infrastructure investments in roads and bridges\nLess safe bridges that are less safe\nAnd we are hard investing in the states and the way that we need\nLast year California legislators decided to patch that hundred thirty billion dollar hole\nBy raising the state's tax on gasoline from Eighteen cents a gallon to thirty cents\nAlmost immediately a group formed to put forward proposition six to overturn the increase and require all future hikes to be approved by voters rather than legislators\nCalled the ... is chairman of the yes on prop six campaign he blames the poor infrastructure situation on mismanagement politicians have more than enough money to fix the roads they just keep diverting the money\nSo we don't need to add the cost of living burdens to working families to fix roads they should be putting the existing gas tax into roads rather than increasing it but even if the gas tax word to stay the same it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demands for one thing these types of having been indexed to inflation\nAnother reason to be seen directly across that street\nLA at a Honda dealer\nSeen directly across that street in downtown LA at a Honda dealership\nIts windows advertise hybrids another fuel efficient cars Christian ... is out on the lot joking with other salesman\nI ask him how many people come in looking for good mileage most of the time\nTouch when nine customers coming for the efficiency of course they're looking for a guest\nAnd they're finding it some

finance at San jose State University\nAnd as a result they're paying less in gas taxes and they were previously\n... group which receives some funding from the new gas tax estimates that if voters overturned it by approving prop six the state will have four to five billion dollars less to spend on road repairs every year and that gap is likely to grow because of the rise of electric vehicles\nNow starting maybe ten years from now we will need to seriously think about transferring from gas taxes to something else perhaps a mileage the\nHe lie Lipman with new LA says the new gas tax is already on his way to making life better for California drivers\nSo you're waiting rooms with a training rooms right of course are over there the beautiful weight room ... new drug so this is a big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the place where the rubber meets the road um so what keeps you up at night\nWhat's your worst [laughter]\nKeeps you up at night but what's your worst [laughter]\nMy ... my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us\nAnd and be part of what we're building and we've missed the class every year for five years so this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to in in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that\nI don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but are kind of have to ask her view a little brown and ... and Magic Johnson drug for basketball and then you know ... and the other best for her to have you guys have the conversation on yourself about work the season we're kind of be rebuilding\n[noise] um yeah you you know yes I mean magic has definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations\nWhat I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball\nWas that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor both couples like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we've had three coaches and three years you know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was not matched\nOvernight and so the ... everything was not matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are marketplace all the time you were in uncertainty and and not only does regular business uncertainty so too does the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose forced to write uncertainty was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go don't run into the ground to say oh yeah who looked like\nIt it would you break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I asked him how long is it going to take you to\nGet the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on I realized it wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite kitt [laughter] her son's if all\nOf a ... or want to hear about your family right I mean Dr Bush or did your brother who worked with and then and then had to replace\nYou talk a lot you talked about it in your book where we've talked about it in interviews about how this is a family business show those first couple of years when the commercial lead culture and says don't blow it with the family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was\nWas very very difficult um you know my dad kind of set it up for us but ultimately he gave me\nKind of set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority\nTo accomplish what the goals are meaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke them your question about about making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of years did you wait too long\nThat was my first comment publicly was I Apologize to Laker fans because perhaps I did wait too long um as you can hear the music that are only ... it's it's funny

junior who runs the society for human resource management says it's getting harder and harder to keep politics out of the office\nWere constantly being bombarded with these topics there the the

someone was going to win someone was going to lose\nListen get yourself together someone was going to win someone was going to lose but we have to run our business\nAnd businesses have to maintain a

more than forty percent said they felt excluded at work because of their political views\nSusan ... who runs the HR consulting firm exactly oh says companies have to be careful or they could get sued\nAnd there's a lot of laws around how certain behaviors in the workplace are governed and that makes it harder for organizations to ignore complaints or frustrations around political talk\nThere are some people who think it's important to talk about politics at work Margaret Morris winning is a rabbi and a teacher at Hebrew Union College in New York she says arguing is part of her job description\nIt's preserved in the Talmud which is to a great extent arguments that either actually happened or that we're imagined\nWinning and her colleagues argue about a lot of things including
