sits right now at three point one nine percent that's the highest that you know the interest rate that that bond pays the highest it's been since two thousand eleven we've got marketplaces ... on the phone from New York to talk all things bonds and put this into context they bring\nHey they're kind of so look I was listening I think actually it was you yesterday on the marketplace morning report giving me a the yield on the ten year it was three point zero nine so here we are almost thirty six hours later it is eight ten percent higher attempt percentage point higher what gives\n[noise] okay so generally speaking this is happening because the economy is doing great now why specifically yesterday\nI mean like if it's like if you're trying to push your car out of a ditch why did it suddenly move that second you know but one reason could be that there was a very good number I'm I have some index of ... non manufacturers service industries that was near a record high yesterday\nBut generally you know you have a low unemployment three point nine percent of GDP Growth rate ... percent second quarter this\nAll this great news and it just keeps on piling up and piling up a means that\nA investors could be thinking that inflation is coming up here so and if inflation is going to be actually coming we also saw an oil prices rise are rising right so if they think inflation coming\nThen that could eat into their long term investment and a ten year treasury the long term investments are they're going to need a higher yield the other thing is that uh this could be telling us that investors believed the fed is going to ... keep on keeping on raising right right right and ... and ... so that influences like\nWhich is which is what Jay ... talked about and we'll get to back that we'll get back to ... but let me ask you to sort of I think related questions\nTalked about and we'll get to back that we'll get back to ... but let me ask you to sort of I think related question is the first days what does what do rising American interest rates mean and the global economy we have talked about emerging markets on this program for some of the problems are having give me the give me the framing [noise]\nWell the better things are doing here the more money this is going to suck out of the riskier parts of the world so you know petty turkey and pity Argentina um you know if you're an institutional investors are out in the world and you were just looking just scrape and for the bottom of the barrel for somewhere to put your money\nYou know you were playing around with turkey plan aren't Argentina player of these other places in the center of the United states 'cause scraping 'cause that's risky over there right that's the deal yeah exact rights risky yeah it's super risky financially unstable lots of political problems\nYou know and and so yeah the roads are things that are here people are like I'm just going to I'm just gonna put this money back in the U.S oh that hurts those countries currencies\nOkay ... but if I had been living on a my savings account or interest rates and my ah certificates of deposit interest rates which for a decade now have been ... basically isn't this admittedly small pickup word a sign of hope yeah it is\nYes that's right savings account or returns are going to go up that's a that's exactly right now on the other hand so is your credit card rates so is your mortgage it's not a surprise that the thirty year national average mortgage rate is also in a multi year high jumping with this ten year bond a yield so above them\nAll right uh back to Jay Powell super quick we've got a half a minute I'm he sits there the chairman of the fed does and he sees the bond market reacting in the way that in theory he wants right he wants a he's been raising rates and he wants this to keep picking up what do you think he's singing good great\nThen he wants this to keep picking up what do you think he's been getting good great that's what I Want that's what should happen everyone's getting the message or and also it's happening while the economy is doing great so right now it you know so it's working out which\nIs even better so British or New York talking moms thanks very short aren't talked too soon it's going to be interesting to see what happens by the way with those bond yields tomorrow morning say oh eight thirty or so east coast time when we get the September unemployment report best guesses are going to be pretty good lots of new jobs a new low low rate on unemployment which becomes\nA big deal when you think about this we're getting old so close to the holiday hiring season writing given the strength of the economy that debris was just talking about holidays sales are expected to be pretty strong too which means Georgia going to be busy which means they're going to have to be hiring so what's it would be employer to do in the search for those new hires marketplaces Justin how has that

that higher wages will bring in people who need the extra income\nIs really no such thing as a labor shortage in economics\nHigher pay could cut into profits for retailers and make gift buying more

expected to jump by more than four percent this year economists Sarah house at Wells Fargo says workers are benefiting to\nDecide this week with Amazon increasing their minimum wage leasing target and Walmart increase the level that they're bringing in workers'\nShe says retailers could ask employees to work longer hours instead of bringing more people on that would be good for existing workers if they need those hours bad for shoppers you'd have to wait longer lines at the checkout counter with fewer employees around New York I'm Justin how for marketplace\nOn Wall street today but we did that

we have a dynamic and strong and growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on how things might play out\nI think it's pretty striking that we've basically spent the last year and a half alienating our friends punishing farmers and manufacturers with tariffs and counter terrorists\nBreaking apart the hard won alliance that we had built um [laughter]\nTo try to isolate China and we ended up in more or less the same position that we were in before which is NAFTA is still more or less in place a plus elements of of the Trans Pacific partnership which Trump had broken up or had had pulled us out um last year\nSo you know I I think the best thing you can say about this deal is that it could have been a lot worse and markets clearly a breathed a sigh of relief\nThat the existing structure I is kind of ... there are that that Trump did not break globalization despite his rhetoric [laughter] suggesting that he had hoped to do so\nBut that's a good one the debris

process taught us is that even something that should have been a sure thing\nWhich is to continue on with NAFTA which is essentially what happened\nTook a long way longer with much more drama than probably necessary and that's with the north American trade agreement right now let's look at something much more complicated that really speaks to the future of China and the development of the emerging world\nUm where we are in a negotiation in which we do have some solid um reasons for pushing forward\nBut a China also has some solid reasons for pushing back and so as much as markets chaired the continuation of math or some kind of knew named as rose that smells a sweet [laughter] um\nIt's hard to translate a U.S flow when in North America\nWith a long process with the rest of the

mentioned like getting budgets through for example that Congress has to manage or and and the presidency is well the executive branch as well\nUh at some point there will be a crisis and the fact that we have so much political dysfunction suggests that we're in store for a lot of policy dysfunction and when I have talked with people who were around for the last crisis\nUh ten years ago that that's the number one thing that they said that they that keeps them up at night that basically what's gonna happen when we actually need everyone to work together and come to policy conclusions that may not be a popular ones knew what you quickly for sure\nAnd I just want to add on to what Catherine I think just said which was you know this is occurring the ... the political dysfunction if you wanna call it that it's occurring at a time where we have really strong economic health\nAre a lot of wealth being created in the economy and investors are are benefiting we're seeing some wage growth\nUh what
