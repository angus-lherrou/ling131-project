which is what we're going to do and it Lopez is a Business Insider ritual Abrams is with the New York times they're both in our New York studios everybody\nAct a so let me let me start with you a will go back to Monday or the deficit figures from the Treasury Department up Seventeen percent from a year ago seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars it kinda seems a that those numbers of lost all meaning though they are well\nSort of I mean everyone told Republicans is was going to happen and they did it anyway it um you know the the\nThe deficit is the difference between how much we're spending and how much we're collecting how that continuously grows\nFor some reason conservatives have managed to convince Americans that if we collect less money will have more money against all logic so now everyone's and in the Republican Party saying we might have to cut entitlements because now we have this crazy deficit and a more money is going to go to interest payments\nWe can have that everybody told them from the beginning that this is how it was going to look\nAnd uh it's just sad that we have this kind of weird cognitive dissonance it\nBears mentioning here not for the first time on the radio program originally rooms with the tax cuts have never paid with themselves [noise]\nRight and so I think the I think that that sort of the great irony and all of that says that um the tax cuts GOP push through which primarily benefitted or I I guess you should say benefited corporation and a and very wealthy individuals the most that in order to pay for those tax cuts uh you have Mitch McConnell talking about ... ...\nPay for those tax cuts uh you have Mitch McConnell talking about ... ... to ... cuts to entitlement programs\nAnd I think that kind of goes back to the question of well why do we care about the national debt why do we care about the deficit um it wouldn't you spend increasingly more and more and more money you have the calls to get rid of entitlement programs like Medicare Social security that kind of stuff\nAh those calls get louder and louder and louder because um you know the because of the Republicans are going to be ... at at least right now advocating more for businesses and then for those programs\nSomebody just cynical person might say [laughter] so whenever they wanted to do from the from the beginning was make it necessary\nTo shrink with federal and learn and they will do let's be clear Paul Ryan said this going on a year ago now right that that entitled the entitlements where the next thing but rich let me let me continue with completely foreseeable circumstances that now appear on our national arise and uh there was news this week or more trade unrest Wilbur Ross was in Europe complaining about the European trade deals\nOr the Chinese now that is another thing that has seemingly heated up again with Larry Kudlow saying things but we got hard numbers from deep BMW down in South Carolina it's these terrorists are going to cost them a half a billion dollars a year it's not like nobody knew this was coming\nYeah and I think especially going into the midterms people are really wondering you know how it's going to go into effect really hotly contested races you have soybean farmers in Iowa that were really concerned about the price of their crops going down because of the trade war\nI'm ... President Trump announced that he was going to be providing twelve billion dollars in aid to farmers that are hurt by the trade war which hopefully will help boost up a sort of his core constituents source centrally we're subsidizing a trade war perhaps too\nCore constituents sore centrally we're subsidizing a trade war perhaps to help her in the Republican Party mushrooms and\nI'm not who knows who knows right before we sat down here Mattel or announce that it was going to have laugh so Ford has already announced they're going to do laugh so old nice to have the Americans\nBut wait a second because when the president says is on the stump all the time the economy's doing great unemployment's low we got corporate profits this week when it from the banks which are making ... billions of dollars what's not alike\nWell except for some one time charges and those tax benefits than benefit from those tax cuts actually their balance sheets are looking pretty shabby which means that the regular business of lending to Americans who can afford to pay back those loans is not doing so hot which is an indicator that\nUm maybe things aren't going as well as a as people are saying wage growth continues to be pretty slow\nUm and it also indicate that probably over the next quarter if they don't have those one time charges were going to see a much ugly quarter and the stock market is probably going to react pretty badly to the Joe uh enjoy the fun while it lasts ...\nOn the market thing which I don't want to go too far to this but it's interesting the volatility that has come back in the last like what two weeks now the ... and we haven't seen for very long time\n[noise] yes uh and it's really interesting because the president has taken a lot of credit when we've seen surges in the market he has blamed his predecessor as when we have seen depths\nUm I don't really ... and I think a lot of people a lot of economists and five financial and business experts would agree that the market sorry the stock markets are not particularly good indicator up some of the economy overall but we're definitely going into the midterms anytime we do see a surge we are going to see I'm the president probably promote a you know\nWe are going to see I'm the president probably promote a you know promote what he's done over the past\nYear and either dramatic falls like a thousand other points that I mean it is yeah ugly yeah and of course Trump used a tweet that if that happened to president should be fired or zinc Barry Obama administration is the only ... there is a treat for everything\nWhen you get the last word you got twenty seconds to do it just really quickly the fed minutes this week and and Jay Powell basically saying everything's fine we're going to keep raising rates everybody stay calm\n[noise] yeah I mean the you know we're there's no reason for him not to trade change course I think for the stock market again is not the economy and President Trump should have absolutely nothing to say about the fat so there's actually no reason for drum how to change course it's not in his data\nAnd the stock market should not be something that he's worried about in fact he what the fed is probably looking at is topping above all\nOh and somebody's phone went off seriously you guys you been doing this for a long time now turn your phones off in the studio Lopez's Business Insider ritual Abrams at the New York times it's friday by by a Wall Street today was a little over a little of that will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nCorporate story of the day today is brought to his by the letters tea and gee as in the consumer products can glamour Proctor and gamble this morning the company posted it best quarterly sales growth in fun\nConglomerate Proctor and gamble this morning the company posted it best quarterly sales growth in five years which comes after years of basically no roads everything\nWas up razor blade laundry detergent healthcare products do but the real driver was beating and beauty and blue booming global demand for that stuff which is hoping the old established brands and the upstart does marketplaces ...

[noise]\nBeen a complicated a couple of years for Facebook in this economy also for mainstream media both are being criticized by politicians some politicians anyway and by the public to some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out Facebook needed that content to users and a court filing this week sheds new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot to video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair walking to the program\nThanks for having me to go back a couple of years ago April to thousands sixteen ... says we are pivoting video at Facebook and journalism to does what generally been painted with that yeah basically and they say\n[laughter] journalism tickets with it basically\nAnd they say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this law suits but maybe it didn't work out so well\nRight so I I mean I think for publishers this was kind of a second costs fallacy they've already invested a lot of resources and Facebook are these events but kind of eating into traffic so in Facebook's has represented video\nIt's kind of like a thing where Facebook says jumping publisher I say OK how high man so they invest all these resources into doing video\nAnd then in twenty six you know twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructured to eliminate writer even higher video producer is how this happened to places like a MTV News and having to lock it as\nMike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nOr so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but uh and the reason is germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook said wait ... these video fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this lawsuit this week not only were they less impressive and thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group of advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that Facebook inflated the number is by in some cases allegedly up to nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were saying with as many of your town [noise]\nPart of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nI mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go around here right obviously a Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers in public\nObviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe arguing their own homework and aren't keeping tabs on the number is ... they should have been a seems like publishers were a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream and ah yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of numbers\nShow even beside the numbers though one has to point out that the publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the newsroom people were laid off organizations were changed and or oh I'm Sorry to use this word it permitted um because of what Facebook should do\nYeah I mean again it was kind of a case where\nMedia in dire straits and publishers are looking for new revenue sources and they see this video thing ... book is doing and they think this this could be at\nAnd and they kind of just jumped in both ... what does Facebook have to say first of all I Know a lot it is obviously refuting the fried claims and the lawsuit right now\nIt did um I mean obviously it took them a kind of building twenty six team when these discrepancies kind of first uh emerge publicly but I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that didn't do anything wrong\nAnd we should say this matters opening and Gordon and everybody's going to have the absolutely Microsoft ... of a bicycle thank you [noise]\nFollowed all the
