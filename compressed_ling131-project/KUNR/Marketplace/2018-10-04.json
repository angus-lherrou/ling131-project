reports the president took part in quote dubious tax schemes and another quote outright fraud that led his father transfer to the president\nAt least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars and that is in today's money and in the process minimize the tax burden or for the president we should say denies any claims of tax fraud or tax evasion and in a tweet this morning the president said\nQuote the failing New York times did something I've never seen done before they use the concept of time value of money and doing a very old boring and often told his piece on me at a quote\nSetting aside for just a moment the old boring and often told a bit what exactly is the time value of money and what does the president think it has to do with the times piece on him and his taxes marketplaces Mariel cigar gets going\nThe time now use money is well I'll let Jennifer ... pulling explain she teaches tax law at University of Kentucky\nThe basic concept is that a dollar today is worth more than

says the time value of money is fundamental to business decision making let's say you own a manufacturing company you're deciding whether to expand and existing factory or build a new one\nThe new factory may take longer to come up and running but then maybe it has higher returns in the future\nSo you need to think about whether those higher returns will make up for the last time when the factory is being built and your investment isn't making money Jeffrey fossil men at the wealth management firm relative value partners says this concept matters to individuals to he says sometimes clients want to keep money in cash rather than risk losing it\nAnd talking about the merits of investing versus not investing there's a cost associated with not investing in that is due to the time value of money\nIt's not clear what President Trump was referring to when he tweeted about the time value of money he wasn't specific and the times story doesn't mention it the writers did adjust all their numbers for inflation expressing them in what's known as today's dollars but that's a different concept ... for marketplace\nOne hopes we've explained it to guys right I mean right anyway so I'm driving cars are the future as we know the only question really is how much that future is going to be worse\nAnd we've got a hint of unanswered today Honda announced this morning is going to invest seven hundred and fifty million dollars in GM's autonomous car unit with another two billion dollars coming over the next twelve years\nBut as a whole lot of money going into products that right now

avenue ... was drizzling last friday when we had it over to the quarters headquarters rather have J. P. Morgan Chase security guy medicine took us up to the forty eighth floor\nWhere we called our heels for a little bit waiting for Jamie diamond that's on us we were early\nSo we had a chance to poke around a little bit lots of sports memorabilia on the shelf business and management books to interestingly enough bank history stuff as well diamond showed up pretty much on time we did the usual chitchat as we got settled talked about how we got into banking he's the son and grandson of stockbrokers by the way and then we got down to it\nDo you think um people understand banks in this economy like you understood banks when you were a kid I sometimes people those same things as a\nConsumer so you know if you've taken a mortgage you have a checking account you have a business need alone if you're a large corporation you have to sell equity your debt that they understand they don't necessarily see the inner workings of a bank does it matter what it does to me but I don't I don't think should matter to the customer now with the customer wants to do good experience and you know good credit card and a good yeah\nYeah but does it matter whether American consumers understand the way the financial system works\nI think ... I think it matters to understand how business in general works\nSo if you don't have a financial system you don't have an economy so defense has been just part of his great economy in America has the widest deepest most transparent financial markets the world's ever seen in total I'm including private equity venture capital the formation of business the trans parents\nVenture capital the formation of business the transparency of our capital markets and no other country in the world has it it's not even close as kind of it's kind of a part of the engine that makes us the most prosperous economy in the world\nYou come to that we just come to that not without some scars right and we get to the crisis or a little bit later on but but what do you think um the financial sectors role in this society is what does the banks responsibility in this society I\nThink the most important thing is you help grow a prosperous economy that helps the most people\nAnd they create the wealth by which you could take care of your old you're sick you're poor and so I I think people should understand that you need a healthy banking system my daughter asked me and the financial crisis\nYou know which of Christ they said was the kind that happens every seven to ten years I wasn't being facetious\nI was looking at Nineteen Seventy four Nineteen eighty two Nineteen eighty seven Nineteen Ninety\nAnd ... and one of things that makes me cautious as knowing all that I always always always wanted to run the bank that we can survive anything so that were there in good times and bad times and more more important in bad times for clients\nLots in there and we're going to get to the crisis in a second as I said I I Want to talk for a second about I'm a corporate social responsibility which you are and this banker believer you talk about that a little bit\nI go I I've never believed that the only thing is to maximize shareholder value in fact I don't know any CEOs were that way I think these\nCompanies wait so sorry how how come everybody thinks all companies just want to maximize your ... it just\nBecomes a narrative it gets repeated over and over companies have to do a very good job over an extended period of time to get customers back or companies that take care of customers succeed if they rip off customers they don't to me if you don't take care of your employees you don't take care of your customers you will not have finished\nIf you don't take care of your employees you don't take care of your customers you will not have financial success okay and so they're they're all related and taking care of your customers and clients they want you to be a good committee citizen you were in favor of the president's tax cuts\nWe got but in those days you got the one down the street from my house where I bank I mean right and which country you're in California we've gone from seven or branches to a thousand I think it was a fabulous platform for Jake more to grow so I still would have done that one\nAre you satisfied that um we have the protections in place now to avoid something like that happening again\nYeah you should never be satisfied and I I mean I Want to explain that ... the regularly should I say they really should be happy and take a victory lap I gave you just do leeman redux\nIt wouldn't happen they would have had not\nTwenty below the capital but fifty but because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot more liquidity a lot more transparency if it did go bankrupt at the moment of bankruptcy it would have created another hundred billion dollars of equity remote over cap wise for him in the world\nThe government can run it and do whatever they want that but I think it was an orderly unwind yeah but ... it was a disorderly unwind were asked us with thrown people couldn't get their cash markets we're going to collapse because they had to sell assets\nThat was ... so the capital liquidate the banking system is stronger\nBut with the way you look at risk I I don't just guess what the future as I say what is the worst could possibly be and can we handle it\nAnd to me family means I can still serve my client does not mean to have to run in panic\nBut not always be quite as their question where's the next problem coming from it will be different from the last problem cyberattacks on other institutions clearing houses\nAnd I'm not worried about shadow banking but they're always going to be a shoo shadow banking so if you're a regulator you should be really cautious about what's happening in a way from banks are you worried\nAbout you know given all that cyber and all of that are you worried about um the fed and its actions are and are you worried about uh\nThe fed and its actions are and are you worried about a politicians and then stepping up\nYou know I'm not worried about both we plan for both not being exactly the way we expected so I think the fed is doing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road something happens it's too much inflation the feds move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my in my company could easily handle it but it is possible just likes them just like\nThe terrorists can cause problems you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems just like James who can cause problems I mean you always got to be looking to figure out makes you can handle bad outcomes\n... jumping ahead of my list of questions because I Want to get the terrorists in the second ... but but look back you up for me on the healthy economy and I'm not going to argue that the headline fat thrive jobs GDP all of that good stuff\nBut as you said are on the forty whatever it is Florida this building looking out ... literally yet at the American economy there's income inequality there's wage stagnation which has just recently started to pick up and I mean there are some non small problems yeah\nSo the American public's understand that this is the most prosperous economy world's ever seen you have to wait and I'm not I mean I I I went to it but the good in the back yard so I and so the good as we have wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico\nAre we've got all all of the food water and energy we need\nWe have or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of enterprise the best universities that why is the capital markets and yes income inequality is a real issue and we studied it and they're fixes to hurt\nThe economy has been going in Munich early and it's ... and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation and all these other things that we need to fix okay but law and the ...\nAnd and all these other things that we need to fix okay but law and the architects of the American public to know everything we talk about their or fixes for be put her mind to it and kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it all I appreciate the positivity generally I Do if there was some reality are right\nWe have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back\nFrom the international arena the president said at the at the un across town a couple of days ago is America First right so\nDo you reconcile that with what you call for in your letter which is intelligent thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy\nWhere virtually have slipping a bit so that we have not had more of a cat or Mexico's Eighteen forty eight Mexico's extreme quite well and we should treat them very respectfully but you're absolutely correct this trade issue a medical a skirmish yeah\nYeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade what so what do you see that it's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish 'cause it sure doesn't look like anybody back into\nThat look we devised the president that while you were young while you were you yeah we have and I know lots of us have done it and I'm most was said that we understand the issue to China and he's right\nNon ... barriers will property all intellectual property is owned enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day to president succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey your method worked I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems\nSo she'll put on your your most objective Jamie diamonds self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you\nDon't think so I mean there are all in a lot of leverage zero or twenty eight million companies in America I mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy in there\nI mean you know we we were one actor of many in this economy there are a lot of other big banks are a lot of the I I'm going to be competing window of the Chinese banks folks I I don't say that lightly\nThey they are already they have a bigger home market they make more money to were worth more than the market value that somebody's trying to make more money than we do they have aspirations and they showed their going overseas and they showed their find your Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we\nAlso practical one day with alley pay and we chat and ten cent and so I I look at the world on this ... this is Graham say no we're gonna have competitors I Want jeep more chase be the best bank in the world I wanted to be an American bank and it would be I think it'd be a mistake for America the best brings in the world and the biggest banks in the world were Chinese banks\nWill so here's actually a good phone question do we as an economy or get the benefit of your size that makes it worth the risk of you being so big\nYes because remember scale economy is that is true for banks is true for auto companies are true for ... industries the beneficiary of skill of economics is declined it it's not the company because capitalism forces\nTo return to the company lower uh and and also our size and diversity is why we had no issues to

rate ... percent second quarter this all this great news and it just keeps on piling up and piling up\nA means that a investors could be thinking that inflation is coming up here so and if inflation is going to be actually coming we also saw a oil prices rise are rising right so if they think inflation coming\nThen that could eat into their long term investment and a ten year treasury the long term investments are they're going to need a higher yield the other thing is that uh this could be telling us that investors believed the fed is going to ... keep on keeping on raising right right right and ... and ... so that influences like\nWhich is which is what Jay ... talked about and we'll get to back that we'll get back to ... but let me ask you to sort of I think related question is
