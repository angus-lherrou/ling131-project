gone by and\nThen this this morning from a call he made to Fox and friends\nYou know the Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute if that's all this that's ridiculous what they're doing\nAnd then finally later this morning from a bill signing ceremony in the oval office\nI think the fed is far too stringent and they're making a mistake and is that right [noise] and it's a despite that we're doing very well but it's not necessary in my opinion and I think I Know about it better than they do believe there\nSo if your business and economics journalist what\nSo if your business and economics journalist what\nDo you do with that because the president is just wrong the fed is not crazy or cute or stringent the central bank under both its current enemy to pass chairs has been deliberate and transparent and measures measured as it says about getting interest rates back to something near normal after a decade of keeping them at zero\nAlso by the way when I asked a pal back in July if it bugs him when the White House pokes them in the eye on monetary policy or whether it's going to change what he does he said if you listen between the lines here that\nI had a great a colleague and mentor back in the day who used to bring meetings into focus by saying\nLet's control of control so but we control as long as what we do\nWhat we do and and I just told you what we do

moment to go to the fed chair you had the president earlier this week\nCasting doubt even answered reporters' question does he planned to fire Jay Powell I didn't know that we've gotten there yet this

the present those revised\nYeah leave that point about uh the president a poke and Jay Powell in the ... told me on this program I don't care what the president says I'm gonna do my job but but there is something about um why it matters that presidents attacked ... never happen but but this is real now\nIt really is and right he hasn't done this before and Jay Powell has actually managed to be relatively out of the limelight since the since he took over\n'em but you know who knows I mean this could be here one day and on the next I mean we just don't know um rising interest rates you know it's a good sign this is only good thing it doesn't need to be you know it it doesn't need to be such a bad thing it's not crazy\n[laughter] it's like you're totally predictable do in the sense that
