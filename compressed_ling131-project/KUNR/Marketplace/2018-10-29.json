Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting because liquor basketball's like a brand name\nAnd and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months\nAnything when you're

um\nYou know my dad kinda set it up for us\nBut ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke in your question about about and making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of years the door to one\nThat was my first comment publicly was I apologized to Laker fans because perhaps I did wait too long um as you can hear the music that are only ... it's it's funny
