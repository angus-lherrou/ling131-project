single year oh we're still political party still under invested that average\nIn Texas Beto O'Rourke Ted Cruz's democratic challenger also has ads in English and Spanish he's fluent in Spanish the recording one more add just requires another take not really a heavy investment\nThe real costs to both campaigns goes into figuring out where to place those at Yale University political science professor Alex ... recently published a study on the effectiveness of ads in Spanish\nThe major costs and this is why I think we don't see more candidates and doing it is if you hit a monolingual English only person with a Spanish version they react extremely negatively\nHe says it could be that English only speakers tend to bristle it adds in Spanish because they want the candidates to appeal

kind of keep pushing it to Twenty years and then twenty five and then thirty\nFor buyers predictable payments over a long period of time made homeownership more affordable but for banks a thirty year mortgage with a fixed interest rate didn't make a lot of sense the interest they had to pay to depositors and to borrow money wasn't fixed\nSo in the Nineteen seventies Congress took care of that problem it authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy mortgages from lenders taking the risk off their books\nHave some government intervention that okay I I I have no problem making thirty are alone because I Know Fannie and Freddie\nThat okay I I I have no problem making a thirty year alone because I Know Fannie and Freddie or going to buy it\nAnd that in a nutshell is how the thirty year
