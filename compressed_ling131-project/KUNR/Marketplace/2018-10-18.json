both in terms of how much debt is actually owned and also whether or not their alternative buyers\nBut while China owns lots of treasuries it hasn't actually been buying many more in recent years so the question is really with China dumped the U.S debt it owns as a weapon in the ongoing trade war you know flood the market with lots of bonds to try and mess with US Economy Gallagher thinks maybe anything is I think possible\nGiven the fact that the trade war is more pointed then I think people initially expected\nBut selling off a bunch of treasuries would likely mean selling at a discount
