Lizzie O'Leary in for ... it is Monday the first of October good as always to have you with us\nAnd we start today with NAFTA or rather the deal to replace it last night after about a year of trade negotiations the U.S Mexico and Canada finally reach the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nAnd this we will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars a new purchases of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott\nWas our manufacturing powerhouse uh that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um is this really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it it's unclear so it looks like automobiles auto jobs are at the center of the ... of everything\nAutomobiles auto jobs there at the center of the rhetoric circle of everything and the and and we're a lot of the jobs involved are so a few simple let's say you assemble cars of trucks to sell here in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW right now sixty two and a half percent of your content\nHas to be from Mexico or the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal right and after two point oh whatever yep it was set up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanction ready or else but you have to do these chores or else I take away your phone right we say that in my house or the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you made cars in Mexico where it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession\nYou might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chain in finding parts in Indiana\nWhere it's expensive and his bureaucratic I'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent and since I'm non compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it so that makes for more jobs in China and more jobs in Mexico\nOr let's say OK I follow the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars and sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and there yet in in this to create and protect other jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour walk fit into that\nThere's still says a large percentage of each vehicle has to be made my workers who make sixteen\nStill says a large percentage vehicle has to be made my workers who make sixteen bucks an hour or more\nSo what uh companies do when we just got pushed up will sometimes yes the hiring more workers who make more money\nSometimes they say you know what it's time for me to want to invest in Warsaw afterward and more robust more automation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might\nWell so looking a little more broadly to take off all of the terrorists against Canada and Mexico you know not all off the table um it's a little confusing what's here and what's not yet\nSo right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place in the justification is because of national security so Canadian steel Mexican steel still subject to that and it's more it's complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles\nComing as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration on that that's on a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\nAnd filing interesting here in D.C today what are the chances this all gets approved by Congress well good\nLuck with your predicting a vote on this would come next year after the midterms when there is a good chance that Democrats could we will take the house rights and historically Democrats have been more anti trade deal that this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to give the president a victory that's a different question\nMarketplaces ... thank you very much You're welcome\nNAFTA has had

It's Tuesday October seconds\nGood to have you with us before we get to the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders he called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop Bezos act\nAs an Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\nThe bill would tax big companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing to encourage those employers to pay higher wages\nThat is reportedly true in some states of Amazon well the company announced that as of November first it's raising its minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this\nShe's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour\n... kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nAmazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by that\nThey specifically mentioned part time and temporary workers are they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions and the ...\nAlmost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions\nAnd I should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States\nIs about it's about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely a a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment center workers Amazon and its announcement also said it's going to lobby Congress\nTo raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour but even without the federal wage increasing this likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Walmart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour\nThat's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the the movement in that direction\nReally I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier um so that's kind of wanting to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market as Walmart is by the same token a lot of other firms are already announcing\nThese types of bigger wage increases so for example targeted aside at wanting to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nAre lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas\nWhat kind of impact do you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly there are places where this raise we'll have more buying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies it also does\nDid that in general should be a good thing for those local economies\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses on their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local markets\nA would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement\nWe're going to look at how far are Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy Amazon has what two hundred fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut if you are of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend when\nPay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy\nThat's good in general for growth um we also going to want to keep in mind what's happening with inflation if wages go up generally that's great but we have been experiencing some uptick than inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail Wozniak teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much things any\nAs the professor and I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit\nMeanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage so what's it like to live on Fifteen dollars an hour
