Tuesday October seconds good to have you with us before we get to the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders\nHe called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop Bezos act\nAs an Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\nThe bill would tax big companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing to encourage those employers to pay higher wages\nAt is reportedly true in some states of Amazon well the company announced that as of November first it's raising its minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this\nShe's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour\nWaiting kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nAmazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour or so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by this\nThey specifically mentioned part time and temporary workers are they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions\nAnd they should also apply to whole foods cashiers and average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States was about uh about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely a a raise\nSo for those folks this is likely you a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a\nLarge set of their core fulfillment center workers Amazon and its announcement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour but even without the federal wage increasing this likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean\nWal Mart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour\nThat's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the\nThe movement in that direction really I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more\nThan a cashier um so that's kind of one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market\nAs Walmart is by the same token a lot of other firms are already announcing these types of bigger wage increases so for example targeted aside at wanting to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact do you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly there are places where this raise we'll have more\nBuying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses um their ability to recruit and retain workers and those\nSmaller businesses on their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local markets a would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement\nWe're going to look at how far are Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy Amazon\nHas what two hundred fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut if you were of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend when\nPay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy\nThat's good in general for growth um we also going to want to keep in mind what's happening with inflation if wages go up generally that's great but we have been experiencing some uptick than inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail Wozniak teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much things any\nAs the professor and I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit\nMeanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage so what's it like to live on Fifteen dollars an hour marketplaces Renata Sago talked to some of the people who would know best\nAlex Harris is twenty two years old and works two part time jobs in Florida he makes sixteen dollars an hour as a community organizer and nine fifty at a fast food chain he says he's able to pay his bills and bus fare but\nThe at a fast food chain he says he's able to pay his bills and bus fare but earning Fifteen dollars an hour full time with health benefits would help\nBut I just told me it's just a permanent job for miles but after like if you're like forty hours every week or more than that will be alert show much\nSharon ... Peterson is forty two years old and lives in Utah she's made Fifteen dollars in the past working odd jobs and said she was able to manage as a single woman now that she lives with her husband and his raising two kids she relies on renting out rooms in her home and her parents chip and money\nIf we had bought this house when we did we wouldn't be able to survive on Fifteen dollars an hour there's no way\nBack in Florida Alexander Saunders received a raise last month after a few years of making a little over Fifteen dollars an hour twenty eight year old credits that wage with him being able to pay off his debts\nI actually just paid off last year at a car loan fight\nHe says he wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't been living with three roommates\nSplitting rent some was um the norm is all\nWhile workers in cities like New York Los Angeles and Seattle have seen their wages go up to Fifteen dollars in recent years the fiber Fifteen as it's known continues and now Amazon employees across the country will get to see how far the Fifteen dollar wage will take them I'm Renata Sago for marketplace\nWe have another slice of the Amazon story on line today and explainer on

decides which beaches to protect in which to leave alone\nThat this is sort of decided on a case by case basis some communities actually find most of this work themselves through local and county taxes and so in that case the federal government isn't really involved\nBut for many communities it's the Army Corps that decides\nWhich communities get funded and the way the Army Corps makes these decisions they use an economic formula that ends up favoring more affluent communities and the reason that is is that the corps tries to see\nWhich projects can they fund where they'll get the most out of every dollar spent\nSo in essence it ends up favoring more affluent communities\nAnd not just affluent but predominantly white right\nYes um so the analysis we did in North Carolina we looked at about sixteen communities that have received funding for these projects and the average uh demographics in those communities but something like Ninety four percent white\nAnd you found that the effect is that they're the same beaches just keep getting rebuilt over and over again can you talk about an example tell me about rates ville beach\nSure right still beach has been rebuilt I think
