signs of trying to shoppers becoming more frugal\nBut I don't think there's any significant evidence that this is a big macro story\nNicholas Lardy is an economist with the Peterson Institute in Washington he says retail sales data recently did show slower than expected growth but that's only focus on good he says spending on services went up plus wages are increasing\nWith incomes rising and the savings rate going down that's a very powerful combination for sustaining fairly strong growth of consumption\nMany economists agree with him so if it's not showing up in the data didn't why there's so much talk about consumption downgrade Lardy says Chinese citizens maybe picking up a larger narrative in the U.S that China's economy is slowing down\nAnd the implications seems to be that China will be very vulnerable\nPatients seems to be that China will be very vulnerable to the terrorists that a President Trump has imposed on Chinese goods sold in the United states\nOther said to

Shanghai I'm Jennifer ... for\nIt's been a complicated a couple of years for Facebook in this economy also for mainstream media both are being criticized by politicians some politicians anyway and by the public to some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out Facebook needed that content to users and a quarter filing this we should some new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot to video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair welcome to the program\nThanks for having me so back a couple of years ago April two thousand sixteen ... says we are pivoting video at Facebook and journalism to does what\nJournalism is what that basically and\nThey say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this lawsuit ... maybe it didn't work out so well\nRight so I mean I think our publisher and this was kind of a second costs fallacy they've already going and I said a lot of resources and Facebook as they see these kinds of eating into traffic\nSo when Facebook's ... video it's kind of like a thing where Facebook that jumping publisher I say OK how high man they invest all these resources into doing video and then in twenty six you know twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructured to eliminate right or even higher video producer is how\nIt's happened to places like at MTV News haven't got Bach it as\nMike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nAre so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but uh and the reason it's germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook said wait where were these video fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this lawsuit this week\nBut your fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this lawsuit this week not only were they lost and president and thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group that advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that Facebook inflated the number is by in some cases allegedly up to nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were saying with as many of your town [noise]\nPart of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and the media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nSure I mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go round here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe aren't doing their own homework and aren't keeping tabs on the number is as close as they should have been a seems like publishers were a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream\nAnd uh yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of the numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though no one has to point out that that publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the newsroom people were laid off organizations were changed and or or I'm Sorry to use this word pivoted um because of what Facebook's had to do\nI mean again it was kind of a case where obviously\nMedia is in dire straits and publishers are looking for new revenue sources and they see this video thing Facebook is doing and they think this this could be at\nAnd and they kind of just jumped up both feet what does Facebook have to say first of all a not a whole lot it is obviously refuting the fried clams and the lawsuit right now it did um I mean obviously it took some accountability and twenty six team when these discrepancies kind of first ah emerge publicly\nIt took them a kind of building twenty six team when these discrepancies kind of first uh emerge publicly but I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that and it didn't do anything wrong\nAnd we should say this matters still pending and Gordon and everybody's going to have their day absolutely Microsoft is jak writer at a manager Mike ... thank you [noise]\nWas followed on the way out today in which I Am
