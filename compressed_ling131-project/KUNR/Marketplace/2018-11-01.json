instinct and black magic yes so there hasn't been a whole lot of investment in ads targeting Latino voters but as much as in you'll reports from K. U. T. in Austin what voters do here in Spanish language ads can be quite different from what they hear in English\nIn Texas you can see ads for Republican U.S Senate candidate Ted Cruz in English I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message that's his his booming and in Spanish like this ad featuring the standards dad who came to the U.S from Cuba in the late Nineteen fifty\nRomance how about you write

talk about here's this policy here is is a position that's been taken it is completely emotional\nTalking at the heart strings has been the playbook for most political ads in Spanish says Marisa ... she teaches political science at the University of California San Diego\nA lot of the Spanish language ads are really focused on culture on these emotional messages talking about in American Dream and Latino caring about family values shared values\nShe worries that Spanish only voters will be left in the dark if these ads only play on emotion and talk less about economic growth taxes or health care\nIf you need to find Spanish language ads that are meant much more policy content an English language ad then Spanish speaking voters are not getting the same kind of information that monolingual English language from\nAlmost a third of all eligible\nMonolingual English language for\nAlmost a third of all eligible voters in Texas and California are Hispanic and their numbers are growing in

he\nSays we won't have a clear picture of exactly how much has been spent on Spanish ads until after the midterms we do know that spending during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign was less than three million dollars down from twenty million ten years before as a loser things eventually there was going to be a tipping point\nWhere a large part of the electorate every single year oh we're still political parties still under invested that average\nIn Texas Beto O'Rourke Ted Cruz's democratic challenger also has ads in English and Spanish he's fluent in Spanish the recording one more and just requires another take not really a heavy investment the real cost to both campaigns goes into figuring out where to place those at\nYale University political science professor Alex ... recently published a study on the effectiveness of ads in Spanish\nThe major cost and this is why I think we don't see more candidates and doing it is if you had a monolingual English only person with\nA Spanish version they react extremely negatively\nHe says it could be that English only speakers tend to bristle it adds in Spanish because they want the candidates to appeal to their own culture conflicts as the main problem campaigns have is that the data on who speak Spanish and the community isn't specific enough\nYou know this might be some sort of thing\nThe isn't specific enough you know this might be the sort of thing\nThat works better when you can target at the individual level like on the advertisements\nYou're online behavior which you search for and what you read it tells a politician more about what language you prefer than your ZIP Code does which means the future of Spanish political ads could be more targeted to your Facebook feed than what's on your TV [noise] in

Madison\nAnd then basically the F ha kind of keeps pushing it to Twenty years and then twenty five and then thirty\nFor buyers predictable payments over a long period of time made homeownership more affordable but for banks a thirty year mark\nMade homeownership more affordable but for banks a thirty year mortgage with a fixed interest rate didn't make a lot of sense the interest they had to pay to deposit ... and to borrow money wasn't fixed\nSo in the Nineteen seventies Congress took care of that problem it authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy mortgages from lenders taking the risk off their books\nSo again we've some government intervention that okay I have no problem making a thirty year alone because I Know Fannie and Freddie were gonna buy it\nAnd that in a nutshell is how
