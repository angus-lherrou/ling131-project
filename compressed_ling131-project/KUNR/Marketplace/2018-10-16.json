annual shortfall of three quarters of a trillion dollars seven hundred and Seventy nine billion for those of you keeping score at home\nA couple of things are going on here that jumped tax cuts for starters also increased military spending as well\nNow what do about it well this morning Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell called the deficit quote very disturbing and then pin the blame on Medicare Medicaid and Social Security so we asked marketplaces Tracey Samuelson to look into how much government debt is too much for the American economy\nLike many questions and economics the answer is\nThere's no quick and easy after\nKenneth Rogoff isn't econ professor at Harvard\nIt's clear that the U.S can bear a lot more debt than it has a today is low interest right\nEven with bigger deficits even tax cuts that will add over a trillion dollars to the debt and the next ten years were not approaching that's scary too much debt level says definitely health and a professor of

in other words will just spending make the future economy more productive or not\nThat's looking at that through an economic lines through a political ends the debt me already be too big\nThe license scenario if there will be pressure cut spending elsewhere\nRobert polling is director of the political tiny research Institute at UMass Amherst\nIf the Trump Administration is committed to continuing to increase military spending the only place where you can get a substantial amount of savings out of the rest of the budget is in health care\nIn other words Medicaid and Medicare which Senator

percent\nNow it's Twenty one percent and for banks and other financial institutions that's doing one thing to sing on it [laughter] that's Nicole ... director of federal projects that the Tax Foundation\nShe says while the corporate income tax with thirty five percent most companies found so many loopholes they weren't actually paying close to that but for more tightly regulated banks the tax cut was really real so bad\nRegulated banks the tax cut was really real so that boost plus a temporary provision in the tax law allowing businesses to the duct capital expenses now and not over the years as they please she means profits\nPlus that that just raised interest rates again it's pretty much win win win for banks says ... finance professor at UCLA\nBecause of the tax reform on because of the rising interest rates and generally the economy's doing OK so all of these things are lining up in favor of the a persistent positive impact and profits\nBut that tax cut is a one time windfall for the banks going forward they'll have to sustain the momentum when there's no tax cuts and next year as corporate tax rate will be Twenty one percent just like this year and that could be more challenging mark mazer is an economist at the tax policy center\nAnd so if they want to see an increase in their earnings for sure that actually have to have an increasing their earnings from
