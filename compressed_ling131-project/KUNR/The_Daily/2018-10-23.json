thousand\nThere is more conversation around the changing demographics of America [noise] and\nThe conversation starts changing from how does the south maintain its reputation as providing equal access to all to maybe this has gone on for too long maybe this\nMaybe they should have gone on for too long maybe this was a law that was necessary for our parents but not for us\nThe voting rights act has required a number of faith in counties where the history of discrimination against minority voters get the pre clearance from the Justice Department or a federal court faith in Washington before making any changes to their voting procedures\nAnd so it's funny when you have Shelby County which is an Alabama challenged the voting rights\nAct Shelby County Alabama argued marches came studying doing years an evidence shows that requirement it no longer necessary\nAnd that challenge eventually makes its way to the Supreme Court\nI have the opinion of the court this morning in case twelve Ninety six Shelby County versus holder\nIdentifies the former ruling the Supreme Court effectively strikes down the federal government's enforcement masters for the voting rights act\nWe find that the coverage formula section for violating the constitution and cannot be use to decide which jurisdictions are subject to pre clearance\nAfter all of the decade of having to ask the government for permission to south breathed the states to be able to enact new voting law and changed her voting laws without federal government permission [noise]\nAlmost immediately across the country you have states start implementing more strict voter registration laws you have some states closing down polling location and then the state like Georgia you have this happen in a wide fashion and others are most outside some even any other state across the country\nAnd the man behind that effort is Brian Kemp\nFormer state senator or a small business owner and a\nFather a hurry girls math George Ryan camped is\nFather girl ran short\nPrime camp is the Georgia secretary of state in charge of maintaining their election\nLaw career in public service the running a business or something like\nHe had kind of free rein to restrict voting access and he and the Georgia State house in state Senate passed what's called an exact match law ... what's that if a Boulder tries to register to get on the election list and\nThey put in their information the state checks that against all the other pieces of information the state has\nOn the individual and if there's anything misplaced something as small as a high fan or misspelled name that could be a problem with data entry that person is put on the pending list or could have their application rejected\nSo even at a typo in a voter registration means that a person may not be able to vote exactly and people who may have set out in the election or had an address change can all be part of this group that has been truly removed from the polls\nSo in Georgia over the last six years you've had\nMore than a million voters who were removed from the voting rolls wow so there's not much debate that these changes that have been championed by camp are disproportionately affecting voters of color minority voters democratic voters there's no question\nAnd a leading figure to counteract the Republicans effort in Georgia if they see April\nAnd ... or ... some of the fat she said and tell you about myself or because you shouldn't vote for me she don't know any\nStacey Abrams is an attorney she is a former\nStacey Abrams is an attorney she is a former romance novel and\nI'm actually I was born in Madison, Wisconsin I only lived there until I was three I just remember being cold and cheese curds that's about it\nHe is a member of the Georgia State house is actually the leader of the Democratic minority there she is a black woman she started in ... to register new voters\nAnd to actually reach out to those populations who were previously disenfranchised or might feel disaffected from the political system\nSo campus is high powered Republican dead set on restricting voting procedures in Georgia Abrams is a democratic lawmaker determined to fight those rules and register as many Democrats as possible to counteract them it seems like these two are\nInevitably on a collision course\nThey are going back and forth for years\nTo secretary of state was investigating fraud allegations against the voter registration group headed up by a prominent Democrat\nAnd it's funny fourteen ... the New Georgia project Stacey Abrams group investigated\nWe do not objective sharing information about what we do objective is a witch hunt and a fishing expedition\nWhich ended up finding no wrongdoing with the group Stacey Abrams has called him a remarkable architect of litter suppression an architect of voter suppression my mission is to tell folks\nHe doesn't matter who you do they have been much linking for years and then after Trump's election where focus starts turning towards the Georgia governor's race they both in their respective parties decide to get in and they're both under dogs\nThey both decided to run for governor exactly and so you have a ...\nDecide to run for governor exactly and so you have a primary election that sees them both kind of you surf the establishment wing of their party and win the nomination for their respective parties\nAnd it's striking that the issue that they seem to care most about that they've kind of defined their careers around will be the issue voting
