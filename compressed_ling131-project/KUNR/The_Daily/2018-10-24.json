Mohammed bin Salman picked a nasty squabble with his Persian Gulf neighbor cutter\nSaudi Arabia has closed Its Food and imposing a defect to feed them cage when the ... the reason behind her cage conscious that ties to pushing her overnight\nKind of just the ... it's the pushing ... likes to collect Islamic state in Egypt ... the Muslim Brotherhood which which ... nice\nHe in prison dozens of wealthy Saudis\nDollar some truth to the nth degree were truly historic upheaval unfold right now around France and be asked rolled out a huge and frankly bizarre crackdown where he rounded up hundreds of members of the royal family and other rich Saudis and basically ...\nIncluding torturing some of them in Riyadh the Ritz Carlton hotel and lots of them were forced to hand over tons of money to him\nHe called it an anti corruption campaign other people nearly called it a PR\nSaudi Arabia considers Canada's comments on human rights in the kingdom to be an interference in its affairs that requires what it calls\nA sharp response he picked an absolutely need literally diplomatic fight with the Canadian\nIt all began with a tweet from Canada's foreign affairs ministry stating concerns over Saudi Arabia's arrest them rights activists and demanding their immediate relief\nAnd then he kidnapped and detain the prime minister of Lebanon\nLebanon remains in a state of crisis more than a week after its prime minister sat\nOut ... unexpectedly resigned while on a trip to Saudi Arabia Lebanon and president Michel ... and others have accused Saudi Arabia of kidnapping how to Eddie and forcing him to resign against his will he engaged in a reckless\nWar across the southern border in Yemen where Saudi led airstrikes have killed an untold number of civilians including many children\nThe Saudis enforce the blockade shutting down ports in border crossings preventing critical age from getting to Yemen\nAnd lastly he hasn't bought the hundred ten billion dollars\nCritical age from getting to Yemen and lastly he hasn't bought the hundred ten billion dollars worth of weapons from the United states that were promised back during President Trump's visit to Riyadh in fact up until now the Saudis have bought only about\nFourteen and a half billion of that hundred ten billion though this huge upside that the Trump Administration was promising has yet to materialize [noise]\n\nSo how is President Trump who has ... bet on him as the western friendly for former responding to these disappointing turns in this relationship\nPresident Trump for the most part has accepted if not endorsed some of these moves\nHe tweeted I have great confidence from king Solomon and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia they know exactly what they are doing some of those very harshly treatments have been milking their country for years lets\nThe White House put out a lengthy statement after the incident with the wealthy Saudis being locked up in the Ritz Carlton in which she effectively endorsed the prince and said he believed in what he was trying to do to clean up his kingdom he has not publicly chided him for the war in Yemen\nHe did ask him to try to resolve the dispute with cutter but when the Saudis basically defied him and continued with the blockade of cutter President Trump went quiet the Trump Administration seems willing to let the prince have plenty of leeway\nWhy would that be though you said earlier that the reason President Trump has that on N. B. S. is that he provides the justification for the relationship he is the best possible face\nHe is the best possible face for all the flaws in messiness of a Saudi Arabian United States alliance\nBut in these actions he seems to be emerging as a figure that would embarrass the United states so why would President Trump not attempt to exercise greater influence over his hand picked leader of Saudi Arabia after this series of events\nI think President Trump would argue that Mohammed bin Salman needs the opportunity to establish himself to consolidate power he's operating in a tough part of the world but above all I think the case he would make is that on the ultimate strategic issue of combating Iran\nWhich is the centerpiece of President Trump's Middle East strategy\nMohammed bin Salman is a critical player\nMember in Yemen Saudi Arabia is fighting the who's the rebels who these are backed by Iran so it's important in the fight against the Iranian proxies in the region to have Saudi Arabia support and so to the extent that Iran is really the big prize for President Trump\nMohammed bin Salman is his wing man\nIn that effort [noise] so what's the message that this inaction by President Trump sends to momma didn't Solomon if he knows that so long as Iran is being taken care of everything else will more or less be forgiven\nWill the messages that he has a free hand to do whatever he wants and that is above all the message that NBS has taken for the last twelve months\n\nAnd that brings us to October second when Jamal ... a dissident Saudi ...\nTo October second when Jamal ... a dissident Saudi journalist enters the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nFifty nine year old journalist one to the conflict with his Turkish fiance to get documents for the upcoming marriage the fiance waited outside for five hours until finally calling police\n... never comes out of the Saudi conflict and what we know now is that when he went inside associate\nWith mud inside the country like allegedly by a Fifteen man Saudi taint the ride that day and left techie in the evening\nHe was met by Fifteen operatives who had been sent from Saudi Arabia [noise] with the purpose of interrogating him and perhaps rendition in back to Saudi Arabia or perhaps simply to kill him and dismembered him which they did\nWith the bones saw that one of the group had brought with them and his body\nWas taken out of the Saudi conflict in pieces in a crime that has riveted the entire world the world\nIs watching and waiting\n[noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Daily", "city": "Reno", "day": "24"}
