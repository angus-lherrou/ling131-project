{"month": "10", "state": "NV", "station": "KUNR", "content": "Do you think of as what do you think explains that reluctance\nI think the Georgetown ... alumni community is ultimately very tight knit\nThat graduating class of Nineteen eighty three with only a hundred guys and I think there's a sense of pride that comes with having one of their own be nominated to the Supreme Court I have heard this from people who say look I'm a Democrat but I still take pride in judge Kavanaugh being nominated surpasses politics\nAnd Robin where did you start your reporting after Dr Boise for makes her allegations knowing your connections to you\nSo soon after Dr Blass before it's allegations surfaced we started getting tips about the name Deborah Ramirez that she also had a story to tell and\nAs a result I started mining my Yale history and sources and to begin to ask questions around the incident as well as more atmospheric information about what those two were like in college freshman year and afterwards\nAnd as you're talking to a former yo classmates what are they saying about who Brett Kavanaugh was in college what kind of person he was what his behaviors were\nWho they're describing is a person who was very much of kind of a party guy known for partying heart in fact the people I talked to said I partied right along with him on they didn't necessarily say they were angels in comparison there was heavy drinking he was part of it so were they\n... and just how hard drinking and partying was according to people you talk to\nYou know a number of people said to me ... was the one at the keg he was the guy standing by the ...\nPeople said to me Brett was the one at the keg\nHe was a guy standing by the keg doing what drinking a lot and actually what was interesting to me was that you know one source said to me that Brett want it to be the guy who got the girls and he wasn't the guy who got the girls so he tended to drink a lot\nAnd to some extent use disrespectful language when talking about women but no one could remember anyone he had dated so there was this kind of an interesting picture of sort of a wannabe\nMan about campus who actually really was known for holding up the walls that was a phrase that I heard a few times and what does that mean and that means the guy who was so drunk he needs to stand along the wall because if he came away from the wall he might fall and so that was known for holding up the walls [laughter] [noise]\nAnd I caught a nominee Brett Kavanaugh outbreaks of silence for the first time\nFor me I found that right after Brett Kavanaugh appeared on Fox with his wife and portrayed himself as something of a choir boy\nI was focused on trying to be number one in my class on the top to the ... are\nDoing my service projects going in church the vast majority\nInformation started to shake out in a more overt way where people were sort of proactively calling me and saying wait a minute that's not the bread I knew one of them went so far as to say you know you can't lie or way onto the Supreme Court\nUm and what did they think was the lie you know stuck Lee that Brett was whitewashing his past\nEver a time that you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened then I for no cause I never have never had anyone\nCause I never happened never said that anyone I don't remember anything about us I Know\nThat he was portraying version of a young person that they did not recognize and they felt was disingenuous and that that went to the level of character\nAnd it spoke to someone's integrity and truthfulness and they thought it was important information for them to share they may not have stepped forward otherwise but this was a bright line he crossed so then came to here\n[noise] you're from the ... just before the movie will be the truth the whole truth and nothing bugs or fruit or else you guys do\nAnd for me and my personal reporting process the hearing was a really galvanizing moment as I'm dealing with these Georgetown Prep alumni who knew Kavanaugh at the time\nSo many of whom had been reluctant to speak before all of a sudden I'm getting inbound calls saying this is not an accurate portrayal we wanted to stay out of this but this is just over the top ... during the hearing he was asked about red knot and what was meant by those were not alumni references and he said\nShe was great friend of ours bunch of us went to dances with her she hung out with us as a group\nShe's a dear friend that we really respect I'm really upset that this has been taken out of context\nA media circus that has been generated by this thought in reported that um referred to sex it did not\nThe people I was talking to who knew him at the time cried BS on this they said Brett Kavanaugh spoke about her disrespect least so did his friends it was not at all if he's presenting it and that's just ally in terms of the drinking\nA drink beer with my friends\nJudge Kavanaugh presented himself as someone who liked fear\nStill light beer\nPresented himself as someone who liked fear\nStill light beer sometimes I had too many beers\nSo did other people and then tried to turn the table on other people in other topics\nI like after that I like beer I don't know if you don't like beer center and um what do you watch the ... one is or what do you want to have\nYou and you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened then I'd be far apart and what happens if\nYou're asking about yeah blackout I don't know if you\nCan you if that's not happened is that your answer\nJohn I'm curious if you have I have no drinking no wonder why\nThe alumni I was talking to say no ... was a very heavy drinker and by the way so we're we all he was not necessarily exceptional into heavy drinking at least at Georgetown Prep but falling down drunk stumbling downstairs vomiting all of these behaviors that we associate with excessive drinking that are at issue here\nHappened to him and happened to a lot of us and he's not being honest about that either he was never the choir boy he's presenting himself to be never never never that was a text message that I got from somebody and the idea was that I as a reporter need to help sort this out because the public is being misled [noise]\n\nThe daily is supported by homeland visor

happened in your reporting after last week's year after the testimony that prompted so many people to come out and talk about like having a high school days\nAfter the hearing what was interesting was\nWe're having a high school days after the hearing what was interesting was the gloves came off\nOne of his ... classmates says the person he portrayed himself to be today does not match the person she knew at Yale room\nAnd you suddenly saw up some of the people who had been reluctant to speak to me in the first place on national television\nI don't buy it I I um I didn't that's not the bread I knew as soon as I met him in college it's not the bread I thought during four years at Yale\nTalking about Brett as a drink or who would get incoherent\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Wylie yeah he was a tea partier often drank the excess and there had to be a number of night where he does not remember\nI had one of my sources said to me anyone who says that he wasn't rip roaring drunk isn't telling the truth\nAnd I would have stayed on the sidelines if he had said um I drank to access in high school I drink to excess in college I did some stupid things um but it now but I never sexually assaulted anybody but to lie under oath to lie about that\nThan what else is true can be to ... you know and the highest position and the judiciary and our lands and not know the difference between truth and lies that that's just terrible it's\nJust kind of let loose in a whole new way and what was also interesting was that whole sense of loyalty to him and those were still protecting
