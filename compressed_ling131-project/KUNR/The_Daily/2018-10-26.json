{"month": "10", "state": "NV", "station": "KUNR", "content": "A move that could jeopardize the rights of more than ... million transgender Americans midterm season\nMore than ... million transgender Americans midterm seeds in a different Republican Congress has again trying to stay in power and why do I see just days away from voting\nThey have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now you know that as long as I Do and we're looking at it very seriously\nAnd the journey\n\n\nOh hello hello congressman whether Hi how're you doing so I decided to call in winter well\nLet me let me let me tell you honestly I thought we were going to make great gains in the Nineteen Ninety four election but I remember being with with Newt oh maybe a week before the election or two weeks before the election and he predicted with absolute certainty that we were going to take control of the house\nOr how well did you get to know and in what context\nOh Newt and I were very very close anthrax was considered his closest political confidant and the house during the Nineteen eighties\nYou know argued about some things and we agreed on a lot of Facebook we believe that there was a Republican majority out there and that we needed to pursue different strategies to turn it into a majority in the house of representatives so remember we'd had twelve years of Republican presidency like eight years Ronald Reagan in four years of George W. Bush\nAnd we elected President Clinton in Nineteen Ninety two minute understood that in the mid term election with a Democrat in the White House there was a great opportunity for Republicans to win congressional seats and we're\nHere because we are taking the first step over things issues the Republicans could run on\nAnd we're checking them in a contract with the American people\nA new devised a contract with America which I worked with him on quite a bit to help give people something to talk about\nEvery item in our contract you supported by sixty percent or more of the American people this is a contract with Americans for America\nBut the main dynamic was\nContract with Americans for America\nThe main dynamic was sitting President Clinton the number of things that aggravated the conservative base tonight I Want to report to you on the progress we've made a mate turned out to vote Newt saw\nThat was going to give us seats that we had never been able to win before\nDo you remember specifically what things Clinton was doing that was riling up the base we asked the well off to pay their fair share\nUm first of all he raised taxes and that was a bad thing\nIf you send the legislation that does not guarantee every American private health insurance that can never be taken away you will force me to take this pen veto the legislation and we'll come right back here and start all over again then of course the\nFailed attempt to pass Clinton care which was probably the biggest negative issue and then there were some social issues\nI Believe that American citizens who wants to serve their country should be able to do so unless their conduct disqualifies him from doing so\nGays in the military and things like I think that we couldn't imagine we're really controversial even but back then they were\nRight and then after don't ask the town I remember gay marriage being a pretty prominent issue\nThis is not prejudice legislation the defense of Marriage Act does not mean spirited or exclusionary it is a preemptive measures to make sure that a handful of judges and a single state cannot impose and agenda a fall and the entire nation\nAnd another one that I remember one so called partial birth abortion yeah and I'm curious how much thought went into focusing on that specific issues because they certainly didn't seem arbitrary\nYeah well you're not wrong first of all the central social issue really was and in my judgment is abortion mhm and the immediate aftermath of roe versus Wade the right to life\nShe really was and in my judgment is abortion mhm and the immediate aftermath of roe versus Wade the ... right to life movement United around the notion of amending the constitution to ban abortion over time\nPeople figured out a couple of things first of all of that there was not going to be political support for amending the constitution and second of all that there was a political support for banning abortion but right fly from much still was quite United around trying to minimize abortion\nVision should be of Bill Clinton you know ran for office saying where abortion is safe abortion should be stable illegal and legal but rare and rare\nHe felt the need to use the word rare because he understood people were an easy about abortion even though they did not want to ban it so binding away to try to restrict some abortions without banning abortion across the board resulted in\nA focus on late term abortions which most people oppose that most people thought by the way were illegal\nThe term partial birth abortion means the person performing abortions partially that generally delivers a living feeders before killing the fetus and completing the delivery\nName partial birth abortion did not exist until someone who want to Japan and abortion procedure is made up this erroneous and inflammatory term\nWhen it came to these particular late term abortions what seemed to me either very clever\nOr definitely cynical depending on your point of view\nIs that it's for Democrats to take the lead a position on abortion and its most extreme which then painted them into a corner\nYeah I think that you're basically right about although I wouldn't but it's not the words that I Do is you know we we have the term Reagan Democrats back then\nPainted them into a corner\nYeah I think that you're basically right about although I wouldn't but it's not the words that I Do is you know we we have the term Reagan Democrats back in the Nineteen eighties and the Reagan Democrats essentially were southerners that used to be Democrats\nAnd blue collar northerners mainly Catholics that used to be Democrats crossed over and they voted for Reagan well in both cases there were Democrats that were at odds with the liberal consensus\nOn these social and cultural issues we've been talking about\nYou take a democratic politician and you'd put them in a very difficult position if you force them to come front and center on some of those issues because it created a wedge between their liberal base if you want to use that term and the more traditional\nConservative cultural voters so to force Democrats to confront those issues you know was a winner for the Republicans no question about it\nYou know it's funny one of those early memories I have from back then was seen Patty Murray and very liberal Democrat from Washington state and who is you know I'm trying to remember her as soon as the senator who was voted in during the year of the women\nAnd I think she was the avatar of progressive promise and suddenly the Senate was voting on the defense of Marriage Act\nAnd she like the majority of Democrats was voting to ban gay marriage and I remember her coming off the Senate floor being surrounded by a scrum of local reporters\nAnd she looked pretty miserable defending her position\nYeah the ... well the Democrats were definitely tortured over those issues and a lot of them change their position to conform with a more liberal cultural view and that accelerated the movement of cultural conservatives into the Republican Party there were no longer\nRonald Reagan Democrats or Bush Democrats [noise] they were Republicans\nSo how do you think the strategy his age\nRonald Reagan Democrats or Bush Democrats [noise] they were Republicans\nSo how do you think the strategy has aged\nWow that's a good question I I think that yeah I I think that there are some issues where it's continued to work but I think that there are some problems\nThat the Republicans face long term because of the changes in the costs are the most obvious I think and it's a place where I think Republicans are changing as on on the old TV T. Q. issues but\nI think that those issues I I don't know if I'd like to say that they have aged well or poorly I I Would simply wanted to say that\nThey present a challenge to Republicans going forward even if in the short term they were working it would seem to the benefit of President Trump and the Republicans\nWho you are anticipating where my mind was moving which is that certainly his latest two thousand for gay marriage seem to be working in the Republicans' favor but as you're pointing out millennial Republicans now more of them favor gay marriage not\nAnd many older Republicans are keeping moan about this issue I keep thinking about how John Kades during the debates you know again this response when asked about gay marriage where he just basically said that his God told them to love everyone\nI I think I think that the gay issue is\nA little different than some of the other cultural issues one of the things that's happened is that everybody today knows gay people that was not always the case as people kept it hidden\nAnd an awful lot of the Republicans you're talking about are confronting a different reality which is this is no longer a logical issue or a theoretical issue this is about my friend jak gr my friend Linda or the people that I Know\nLooking back on it do you think that they were on the wrong side of history\nYeah\nLooking back on it do you think that they were on the wrong side of history\nYeah\nI mean when I Would say\nAnd more broadly do you think that maybe other wedge issues are shortsighted because that was one of them", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Daily", "city": "Reno", "day": "26"}
