she's on the side of the president and you know she signed with the radical liberals in Washington DC tell Heidi Heitkamp her decision on Kavanaugh is something forget\nAnd that is where she found herself for the month of September ... going into October and so that's created the real challenges for her\nSo basically she understands that the national issues that divide Republicans and Democrats are exactly the issues that she should be avoiding in his campaign\nWell anytime you're talking about ready to versus blue you're talking about Democrat and Republican rival partisan issues where people tend to go to their ideological corners that's a bad moment for her because our state is overwhelmingly Republican\nNew handing out from Fox News shows Heidi Heitkamp a Republican challenger up

Heitkamp since she be a no vote I haven't I\nThought that was a tough stretch for her and it was not the kind of stuff that she wanted to be stuck\nSo given this pressure that the Kavanaugh nomination puts on her does senator high camp change her strategy yeah\nOne of the most important jobs of any US Senator is to fully vet and considering nominees to serve on the United States Supreme court\nFor summer hiking was forced welcome to address questions about one or the rush\nToday judge Kavanaugh and I had a thorough and substantive discussion about the importance of the rule of law precedent ethical standards that the U.S Supreme Court reaching more consensus on the court and avoiding activism from the bench so I think all those things will help the court be shielded from politics\nYou first just on the general issue of his confirmation\nI learned more about his judicial record and temperament which will also hopefully become clearer during the sanitary and the Senate Judiciary committee next month\nAnd then after these allegations came out to be more sensitive topic of his conduct and is past\nNorth Dakota Democrat Heidi Heitkamp saying she quotes supports Senator Jeff wings call for a nonpartisan FBI investigation into the allegations about judge Kavanaugh quote which I've been pressing for we need to get politics out of this process and allow an independent law

something called that should be open to can army capital ... but she wants\nFirst made there was something that should be open to could arming capital\nBut she wants desperately not to have to say [laughter] yeah that's correct okay so tell us about the lead up to senator hike camp to vote on the nomination\nSure so central to not say what she was going to do on that vote for weeks and weeks after he was nominated even after the allegations\nIn North Dakota democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp is still undecided on Kavanaugh machine as quickly losing support of women and now she's running twelve points behind her Republican challenger Kevin Cramer and if I Can't votes against Kavanaugh twice as many say they would be less likely to vote for her\nIt was not until about forty eight hours before the first vote last week [noise]\nWe're following breaking is North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp has just told a local TV station that she will vote no on Brett Kavanaugh\nBut she said that she would oppose got\nHigh everyone I wanted you to hear directly for me about why I'm voting against confirmation of judge Kavanaugh my understanding\nIs that what finally spurred her opposition at least that's how she tells\nIn addition to the concerns about his past conduct last Thursday's hearing call into question for me to judge Kavanaugh's current temperament his honesty and his impartiality these are critical traits of any nominee to serve on highest court in our country\nShe was very disturbed by judge Kavanaugh's conduct that the here and in particular that exchange the California had what's called the carpet Minnesota\nWhere the judge cost snap back at some of the club which are at stake whacked out hiking bothered by that she didn't like that conduct she's a former state attorney general she sort of has spent some time in the courtroom and ...

I think in her mind that was not the kind of temperament and she wanted to see on the high court\nDr Ford um gave a heartfelt credible and persuasive testimony it took a great deal of courage and also came had great personal monitor\nPolitically there was obviously pressure and heart this film or cap on and I think it would have been more daring to have opposed to before the allegations Olympic once the allegations came out that put her in a tough spot to support his confirmation\nI spent much of my life in public service focused on combating domestic violence and protecting women and children from the needs of our actions right now are an important thing no young girls and women across the country\nShe has a lot of her career dealing with issues related to sexual assault and you know she may be losing so significantly at\nHer about what matters so if you're going to have a ... you may as well vote your conscience now ... denied that obviously she pretty much things that she's still the game but there's no question that she trailing a nickel\n[laughter] so let's talk about what you've been seeing on the ground there in North Dakota yeah in a couple of days since senator high camp made this decision take us through your trip there\nSo I got the Bismarck on friday and the state cap on the middle of North Dakota and then Saturday\nI wanted to breakfast places in Bismarck talking voters the first one was kind of a traditional diner or you know a lot of folks they're having their scrambled eggs\nFor conservative place obviously there was a lot of support there for ... to talk to one fellow there who is very fond of hiking but there's no fan of Kramer all and he said he thought that Kramer would always all and he was going to support\nHim bought political he thought that she had basically see our fate by opposing capital our place I went to was more of a kind of a lot ... place and I talked to one table for women\nGenerally Democrats or Republicans\n\nOh okay\nA real before we're probably Kramer voters and one was a high camp or any kind of illustrated to be the challenge high campus but he's one of the voters also do a fan of Kevin Cramer said that she talking about that but once I came out against capital that was going to prompt her to make a grudging vote for Kramer\nRent a reason is because of abortion rights because this person strong Catholic anti abortion and just could not stomach the fact that her senator opposed the confirmation\nOf this judge at the same time enough lady at the table there was a high can vote around like a Democrat said that she would've been upset of Hi Kim hadn't have opposed capital\n\nOne I don't remember\nAnd said that's the kind of challenge that she was in you know in some ways are kind of the ... if you do damned if he does\nWhen it comes to voters in North Dakota John what do you think that this ultimately will come down to\nThis is the challenge high can't pass politics has got\nMore polarized as we all do but it's also got nationalized and sort of local issues and regional questions are increasingly less relevant in the federal races like Senate races\nTo more straightforward question of you on the red team or the blue team and there's no question that it is a conservative state not fully her biggest challenge is to put the Republicans to vote for her at a Democrat used to be a lot easier it harder now\nIn other words try as a candidate might to keep things specific and ...\nSo in other words try as a candidate might to keep things specific and local they may have no choice but to pick one of these national teams\nOf course you can pick one side of the other and you know in the past\nDemocrats the more conservative parts of the country and the Republicans the more liberal parts of the country for those lines they rely on a competency to rely on that sort of politics a personality you have to have a wedding charming persona that could really help\nThose things matter less now because politics is too much more nationalized and whether it's a Republican", "show_name": "The Daily", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "10"}
