maybe half a degree matters more than we think maybe let's find out mhm and so the rest of the world the other countries said okay we're not going to change the target were settled around two degrees here\nBut let the sign the world's best climate scientists to tell us why at one point five degrees earlier\nWarming looks like let's make the vulnerable countries happy and just kind of figure that out so what happens with this study so\nThe scientists got this assignment at the end of twenty Fifteen the group chosen to work on this was Ninety One scientist from forty two countries they went to work together they reviewed about six thousand published studies they responded to about forty\nTwo thousand comments from governments and other scientists all designed to do this\nGovernments and other scientists all the time to do this voluntarily they don't get paid do they work for a year and a half on it and [noise]\nA good morning I'm ever going to vote for him to his preschool for civilians governmental panel on climate change to present special report on global warming of one point five degrees\nA couple of weeks ago I went to the city of energy on in South Korea where all of the Ninety One authors of the report were gathered\nI'm I'm gonna move enough food for ... received off the league will give you an introduction to the report um than the coaches will give you some information about their portion goes through the highlights and then we'll\nBe back in ... in South Korea\nWhat did they tell you about the report what did they followed\nIt first of all it's held at one point five degrees of warming looks a lot more like two degrees of warming than we thought\nLimiting warming to one point five degrees C implies changes on an unprecedented scale\nThat we're going to experience a lot of those same outcomes we're going to experience major lots of the ice major lost a coral reef\nThe impacts of climate change in the oceans are increasing risks to fisheries and livelihoods that depend on them\nMajor droughts and subsequent cropped blond that's a lot of food shortages a lot of coastal inundation as well probably tens of millions of people losing their homes losing their livelihoods\nAll that stuff happened at a lower temperature the damaging impacts come with less warming than we thought and that also means that they um\nWith less warming than we thought and that also means that they come sooner in time\nGlobal temperature is likely to rich white point five degrees C between between the two ... two twenty fifty two\nSo within most of our lifetime it's literally like around the corner yeah\nFor everything you said quote the world has been very much\nPlanning around speeding off to degree warming and now we have this new that says that one point five degrees warming is almost as bad and something that must be avoided which makes me wonder how much the world is prepared to deal with that new reality\nSo since this was commissioned by world leaders for world leaders the scientists did something else in this report that I pretty much don't ever see which is they laid out essentially some policy prescriptions for how to do it rapid breakthroughs in technology changes to the way we do farming changes the way we drive\nBut at the center there is one economic policy that could sort of be the driver of all of this change and that is a price or attacks on carbon dioxide pollution and if you look at the report\nAnd you look at the section that describes is several points about the importance and the powerful effect in the\nOr tax and carbon

in a long long macroeconomic analysis is that a coincidence\nI'm going to go with no [laughter] and the Nobel Committee with very clear that they were awarding the prize she William North house specifically for coming up with the idea of a carbon tax to solve global warming\nNord host asks how should economists appropriately address climate change\nI think it's highly unlikely that that's a coincidence because it gives you a class today it was it was a good class\nSo that was last Sunday some of the ... so\nTwo days later I flew back home from Korea and the next day I went to visit William Seward house at\nWas talking about the idea of minutes and what exactly is this idea of carbon pricing shorts or this or do you wish\nShort foods I Do wish to gradually emerging them either wasn't something that just live a life of what it off\nHis idea him sort of breakthrough idea was how can we apply economics to the environmental damage\nThat we know is caused by carbon dioxide and so willing art house created this economic model that look at the science of climate change and how much damage is caused by heat trapping a mission and how you can extract from that\nThe amount of damage caused by a single ton of carbon\nUses to anything I Hope it points so the importance of course\nOne ton of carbon causes fifty dollars in damage to tons of carbon cause a hundred dollars in damage and that damage\nIs quantified in things like rising sea levels that would say damage your home and you know raise your insurance costs and lower your property values All right well that costs has been inflicted ... by a certain amount of carbon dioxide it's it's a complicated model he called it the social cost of\nCarbon pricing carbon putting pressure on the news so season for what they're covered up and there was this the first step in to take\nThat with a true breakthrough once he came up with the social cost of carbon then you can apply that to policy you can take that over to the realm of governments dealing with carbon pollution and you can in a perfect world use it at the tax\nIf if we go back to the basic idea of carbon price which is good you want to raise the prices ... garlic so consumers\nThe prices ... garlic so consumers buy less of the producers find less carbon intensive was producing them\nAnd what the scientists you wrote to the report and why economists who have been studying this issue for years have bad it\nIs pretty much the most powerful and effective way to stop greenhouse gas emissions if polluters have to pay the same amount that they're damaging the environment to pollute you weren't going to create all kinds of markets signals\nConsume consume less carbon intensive electricity but also produces ... coal to natural gas and natural gas to say when so it is the obvious substitution effects\nElectric utilities are going to say wow wind and solar are suddenly looking a lot cheaper", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Daily",
