[laughter]\nThe number of strollers along the way we associate with it\nAlong the way so we have so hand in it but it's meant\nTo me I mean it's hard to imagine how you would decide that it was worth it to take a three month old on something like that and that's the youngest child I met was three month old and\nMy son just imagine and then when I knew that it may\nBe I might have had to or a year old and there are lots of toddlers and ...\nAnd ... for the most part people say that the children are actually not an impediment\nTo find the\nThat they're going but she says she she actually wouldn't have left on had she not then\nNot had the baby because she said well I never left\nShe says the you know being a single mother and not having work or anything to offer her child you know part of the reason that she joined the care of in\nElderly people you know a man with the crutches\nEntire extended family\nIt gives them a vote on the CIA\nA harder look at where we're going to do\nIt would be hard to put a number on it but it's easy to say that half of the group or more are young and that makes sense they're able bodied and will be like and when you're going to\nGo off and they're going to look for work and you\nKnow I mean we'll get a one on\nQuestion of whether people are in imminent danger or they're just seeking a better life theory\nIn danger or they're just seeking a better life it's very hard to pull those two things apart and then there are groups that face grave danger put it on\nSome of them from getting somebody had otherwise I'd met for people today and now this group is carrying I'm a gay pride flag\nWhen I'm On data than those that have to again he was\nGay men and a trans woman who had left El Salvador and high tailed it to the border to try to join the caravan they're drinking discrimination in their country\nAnd middle the\nTrans woman said that she was told that if she went through with the operation that they would cut off her breath so as one man told me if you stick around long enough you're gonna find everything in this group\nThe basketball court where some of the migrants last Monday Night is right next to\nThe river

of them on the family\nAnd and the death on you and he was going for them and a new set of twins that are due on Christmas Eve\nSort of one of them is for them a little while\nHe was gay but get get aid ... photos\nOf the little guys go home for something\nHe says his limping and says that one of his seat is not doing well but he's not going to stop and rest because he wants to keep going with the caravan because he feels safer for their safety in numbers [noise] I'm at the end the there are so many of them\nAnd now that were and what does in his mind what happens when he reaches us and how does this change of circumstance [noise]\nSo the majority of people I've interviewed feel that\nIt's always hard to get across the border and this will just make it easier for them to get through

taking this journey\nYes I think people really do feel that this caravan has given them hoped that they may actually make it I think having crossed the border into Mexico and not having been\nSuccessfully turned back in ... and then being given food and water and use clothes than really being welcomed here has given them the whole\nAs unrealistic as it might seem that the same thing might happen when they reach the U.S\nHere has given them the whole as unrealistic as it might seem that the same thing might happen when they reach the U.S\nA lot of people are drawing that
