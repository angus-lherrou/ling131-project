you know they wouldn't even describe that kind of ACT UP how did they all look at this you know single document\nSo there's a big bugs but when they walk out and reporters are pampering them\nWith questions and some of them Senator Whitehouse are trying to escape they don't want to say anything we're running after them in the hallway saying you know what can you tell us about this report what's your take on this or did they interview and you know kind of elaborate though [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the dignity and respect that she deserves our democratic colleagues did her a huge disservice\nThey're saying that they're the ones who did a better job protecting women that they didn't leak her allegations like the Democrats did\nWe know Dr Ford requested confidentiality but our democratic colleagues deprived or about against her will\nThat they offered to fly to California to interview her in a setting that we've been comfortable for her and would\nHave maintained her privacy so you know they're actually accusing Democrats of running a what one of them I think Chuck Grassley called it a demolition derby\nAnd we're just about destroyed a good person to be on the Supreme Court\nSo for the Republican Cheryl the message is that the FBI report confirms what they already think that without definitive proof that an assault ever occurred\nKavanaugh should be considered innocent and because there's no definitive proof this has all been a calculated attempt by Democrats to hold up this nomination and smear Brett Kavanaugh has time for all that to end and for this guy to get confirmed\nRight\nAnd what about the Democrats how are they spending the FBI report on third\nI Am not allowed to be held I can tell you I'm married\nBelieve that the message was designed to get to the truth is that\nThe Democrats are saying this is an incomplete investigation that it was never intended to find the truth\nThere need ten people recession [noise] during the people there that day that question sat\nThere were many more witnesses out there that the FBI could have interviewed\nSays out there that the FBI could have interviewed\nMany fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts those fears have been realized so\nDemocrats are saying you know no wonder there was no corroborating evidence the FBI didn't look for it [noise]\nSo the Democrats are really disputing that this report doesn't offer any new information they're not saying that this report corroborate\nThose allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh it sounds like what they're saying is that because this report was always so limited in its scope because of the small number of people who were interviewed and the large number of people who were never interviewed that it can't possibly prove anything for anyone that this report was\nKind of a waste of time\nWell right and not only that it can't possibly prove anything for anyone but that it was never intended to prove anything for anyone\nCandidly what we review today in a very limited time if it looks to be a product of an incomplete investigation that was limited or perhaps\nFive a White House I don't know\nDianne Feinstein when as far as I say that the White House seems to be locking what the FBI could do\nAnd ensure that Ninety percent of his emails and memos weren't available for the Senate or the public in the hearings\nAvailable for the Senate or the public in the hearings\nAnd as I talked to these senators today the Democrats I was struck by how many of them were bringing up kind of old arguments that they used at the very outset of judge Kavanaugh's nomination that their hands like what what like they were concerned\nThat the evidently for women's reproductive choice would overturn roe v way that he has a very very\nExpansive view projections for the president has\nA very expansive view of executive power that would enable president from to put a stop to investigations into his own conduct [noise]\nIran and says Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader today and we were on an escalator down into the basement then I set them knowing that this is your plan what can you do\nTo stop this nomination from going forward\nAnd he just kind of shrugged and said\nBut it was really clear to me that\nFrankly there's not that much\nOf anything [noise]\nI think the Democrats\n\nThe daily uh supported by penguin Random House audio dedicated to producing top quality audio books Christina Dodgers vox the newly released novel from Fiona
