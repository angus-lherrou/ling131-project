show or a few hours later [noise]\nGeorge Kevin mine just is a free for [noise]\nMy motorcade in the public expressions of unhappiness bitterness three reasons [noise]\nInside it was the Supreme Court were used it's quiet speed ceremonial\nAnd in a Supreme Court conference room attended by very few people aside from justice Kevin Orr is family and half a dozen justices you sworn into and joins the Supreme Court Mm\n\n\nAdam with judge Kavanaugh now Supreme Court justice I Want to ask you about the damage that may have been done to the court as a result of the past few weeks the idea that\nHad been done to the court as a result of the past few weeks the idea that this process has undermined the courts impartiality what about this process may have damaged the court in that way\nSo this was a great victory for Republicans and conservatives that was bad for Democrats and liberals who was terrible for the Supreme Court the Supreme Court's power rests on perception\nThat people think it deserves to be respected that people think they will get a fair shake their and this process in which the Supreme Court seat was treated really by ... as a political prize\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political\nAnd where the nominee used harshly partisan language\nRevenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups\nReally cast the court in a political light where for it to be respected it needs to be thought to be illegal institution devoted discerning in applying neutral principles of law and not working on politically partisan lines and this entire experience the devastating damage to that immigration\nThis is a circus the consequences will extend long pass my nomination the consequences will be with us for decades\nMay be that he was a conservative to begin with and he's going to vote and the conservative direction but it may also be that this experience which was dealt with very hard for him not something any of us would like to endure true or false accusations of this kind of misconduct\nOf us would like to endure true or false accusations of this kind of misconduct are deeply deeply upsetting so you can understand that it might embittered him\nAnd people fear that maybe it makes them even more conservative than you otherwise would have been drawing comparisons to Justice Clarence Thomas who faced allegations of sexual harassment in Nineteen Ninety One where he was conservatives to start out with\nBut it's at least a possible that the bitterness that lingered for his confirmation hearings caused him to be what he's become which is the most conservative justice in modern memory\nAnd do we have any evidence to suggest that that's what happened\nWhat Clarence Thomas was devastated by his second set of confirmation hearings where he was answering allegations of sexual harassment and in his memoir my grandfather's son he tells the story of hearing the final Senate vote he was taking a long hot bath to try to decompress\nAnd someone comes in and says Clarence congratulations you're on the Supreme Court and he says whoop de damn do where do I go to get my reputation back it's not\nWorth it he didn't think he would ever really recover from those hearings and I couldn't help influencing the kind of judge he would come on the court\nIt certainly is consistent with the fact that with few exceptions he never asked questions he doesn't give us in the press the satisfaction of getting that public sense of him and there's a sense in which he's saying I'll do the job but I'm not planning well\nSo you said that the Supreme Court's power rests on perception what's the difference between justice cabinet or Justice Thomas carrying some kind of partisan animosity with them versus a perception\nIt's an animosity with them versus a perception that say\nIt's one thing for it to be true and it's another thing for people to think to be true right or the public pays very little attention to the Supreme Court and when it occasionally wakes up and typically during confirmation hearings and here's wait a second this is not only about law is a political element to it\nThe Supreme Court's public approval ratings drop\nWhen the court issues a big decision like the twenty twelve decision upholding Obamacare\nEven people who were prove to the decision but thought the court was being political and how it acted\nThe Supreme Court's public approval ratings drop so to the extent the court is viewed as political even if it really is even if people who follow it closely no it to be that perception is very harmful to the court\nWell what are the risks of a court\nDoesn't have the credibility I mean what are some of the practical ways in which a court that somehow doesn't seem as legitimate loses its place in our system\nThe risk is simple the risk is they will order someone to do something perhaps President Trump perhaps someone else and that person will say why should I\nAnd that's happened on occasion in the nation's history Andrew Jackson famously refused to follow a court directive there were questions about how southern politicians were following brown v board of education school desegregation is\nJustice Breyer likes to tell the story that he wakes up the day after Bush Gore which the two thousand case that ended the presidency to George W. Bush and he thought the decision was badly wrong but he was ... and ...\nThat the country did with the court said he should do lots of other countries all over the world there are a Supreme courts they issued decrees and people from their noses\nThere are a Supreme courts they issued decrees and people from their noses at it so the danger is that these vital institution to American democracy loses its footing loses its place\nTo the power of the United States Supreme court rats almost entirely in trust in it it is not guaranteed to anybody including Congress or the president or a state has to abide by its real and\nYeah it's it's like the wizard of Oz you don't want to peek behind the curtain because the whole thing is built on faith and if you lose their faith and if it's thought to be just the third political branch of government we may be in deep trouble\nI felt the nine justices of the Supreme Court may not appreciate that particular metaphor of Oz [laughter]\nSorry [laughter]\nWe'll be right back\n\nTheir daily supported back of my when you shop a bank stream video one line that talk of mine for Twenty years after my has been dedicated to helping the world's top brains deliver fast reliable insecure digital experience as to their customers on all devices\nI got my eight K.
