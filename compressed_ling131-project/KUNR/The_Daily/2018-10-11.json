I think the youngest I've been ... probably when I was like ten or twelve Thirteen and it's just so\nCommon and not one of us who his cat called makes quote unquote a big deal about it because we know that it will continue to happen no matter how much we think about it how many of you have\nOr their spirit and something along\nYou have either ... something along the lines of what Christine Blasey Ford testify to or have a friend who told you something\nHappened that made them very uncomfortable\nOne two three four five six seven eight I\nFriends who who had been sexually selfish for half and race and\nThey sell like even if they don't remember the whole scenario is only like one specific to think that'd be remembered that even to this day like it makes their skin color can affect\nMental you so much by what she said that was the one thing that like always affected her ... lack\nWhen Sam wack [noise]\nNo I have friends that have had something like this happens to them or worse and they have only gone to me and a select group of people about it because of the fear that\nNobody's going to believe them that their parents are going to be angry at them for whatever reason\nTo believe you find that you wanted to talk about any of these encounters and you found that people around you weren't believing them or the questions that made you wonder if they believed you or you just fell on an heard\nEver yes I'm I'm always want to talk about it and I have like I've gone to my mother and talked about what has happened to me but when I told her that she said she should have been like out that lately you should have came straight home and so I kinda stopped telling people who I wanted to\nWell you should've came straight home and so I kinda stopped telling people who I wanted to tell like my other family like close friends of mine because I saw I live\nMy feelings and what has happened to me was invalidated in that\nAre you comfortable saying anything more about what happened to you don't have to\nI was walking home from an evening out with my friends it was around like maybe nine thirty ten and I was walking and a man\nWho I didn't know he was a really old man and he approached me and at first I thought it was like super funny all fun and games because he posts me says oh you just like\nA sexy Britain and I'm like I don't know what that means like ha ha ha but then he like pulled me into like what's it like kids how to like the driveway next to his house and he pulled me there and I started to get scared I tried to fight back but I was not as strong as him and he was\nA very like um he was very vote and\nThen like started to like try to kiss on my neck and tried to like touch my books and I got so uncomfortable but I was capable of getting out of that situation because of a stranger that was walking past and I started screaming for help but feel that to this day I kind of I'm Still impacted\nBy it because when people even go near me I'm Still like I don't want you to get I'm very comfortable\nAnd you just you chose to tell your parents from people around you about it and and\nI took my mother as soon as I got home 'cause after this incident I kind of like ran home 'cause I I guess it was a ... I usually don't run but there was a journal\nI guess there was a trend unless I usually don't run but it was a gentleman was running and as soon as I got home my mom started like why are you home silly and I'm like this is what happened to me is that you shouldn't have been out too late and after that I kind of just stop talking about it\n[laughter]\nSo I Want to shift focus here to pre sensitive question especially given what we just heard\nOne of the conversations surrounding these accusations against\nBrett Kavanaugh is that this was high school\nSo how much weight should it carry given that context and I'm curious what you think as high schoolers should what you do now should what anyone in high school does now follow you around for the rest of your life\nYeah yeah because I feel like like obviously I was like a rite of passage and you've got to make mistakes and learn your way through it but there are certain things that it's just like\nLike saying hateful things to certain minority groups and things like sexual misconduct that kind of stuff all of the victim forever to follow the victims driver well then you've got to do with it too that your fault you know what I mean\nWhen you're sixteen Seventeen a senior in high school you have a moral compass that will tell you what is right and what's wrong so\nIf you're already in the state of mind what are you know what's right and what's wrong I mean you were consciously making a decision to do something wrong or you of consciously making a decision do something ... which is the same thing going to be doing the rest\nOf your life mhm I Wonder what\nOf your life [noise] I Wonder what you think the message was when Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed many of you have talked about the experiences that just happened to you or to people you know that we're a salt and given the fact that he was accused of that\nAnd he was put on to the nation's highest court what's the message to you\nFor all we know it could have never happened but the fact just so the fact that he was accused shows that anybody can get away with anything as long as they have enough power\nOff of that like people that um that are watching him might think oh if he got away with that I tend to because if he did it\nMaybe I'm not going to get caught maybe like even if they bring needs to like a trial like I'm I'm going to be good because look who is now our Supreme Court justice he got away with it so why not mean to everyone else\nIt kind of just feels like a big old out really care about your situation type of thing from like the higher up than the government and stuff it felt like we don't care if you like it or not you have to take it and like it feels like they don't care about our opinion or safety and the fact that we're even here\nEven though we make up like a big\nPercentage of people and it feels like they're kinda just like well that\n\nI really want to thank you all this has been [noise]\nReally remarkable and candid and enlightening and\n\n\n\n[noise]\nOh they're back\n\nThe daily is appointed by beard and financial partner guiding families businesses communities and institutions since Nineteen Nineteen are W bad dot com has more information and by fracture\nCreating modern photo decor and gifts by printing photos directly on glass\nA fracture is an image frame and mount all in one hand made in a carbon neutral Florida factory learn more fractured me dot com slash daily\nDistribution of the daily is made possible by American public media\n\n[noise]\nMm\nGood evening this is Katie when our eighty eight point seven you're listening to the daily\nMm [noise] Mm Mm Mm [noise]\nWe get support from cook elder navigation in Reno providing guidance to families of elderly parents to read the book as this adult children and their families and prioritizing their needs and the needs of their elderly left one information at C O o K e elder now have\nDot com that's cook elder now dot com [noise]\n\nOn the way at the top of the hour we have the world from Reno public radio eighty eight point seven\n[noise] mhm\nMm Mm Mm [noise]\n\n[noise]\nLast week when the president book from his previously measured comments about Dr block before it was at a rally in South haven Mississippi", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Daily", "city": "Reno", "day": "11"}
