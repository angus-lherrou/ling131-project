{"month": "10", "state": "NV", "station": "KUNR", "content": "Clusters of house races around some of the biggest cities in the country so you have a whole bunch of racist right around Los Angeles a whole bunch of races ride around Philadelphia these are places where Republicans are playing defense in areas that\nYou sort of think of as you're Romney Republican district and where the president is not popular but neither are the Democrats and they're not liberal areas so what Republicans are trying to do in these areas is figure out their half a dozen seats around Los Angeles but they're defending can they saved three or four\nAnd what's significant Alex about these geographical clusters what's happening there that puts them so at risk for Republicans the seats\nThat are really the knife edge seeds that we're talking about the ones that will determine whether Democrats gained twenty two seats are twenty four seats in the majority\nYou're mostly talking about districts full of affluent college educated white professionals and why are these the voters who may be decisive in these midterms rather than Latino voters or African American voters\nWhile I don't want to say that any group of voters do not have the potential to be decisive but if you look\nAt twenty sixteen and you look at today the group that has moved the most is white women and especially white women with college degrees and if you're looking at the suburbs of Chicago or the suburbs of Philadelphia those are the people who voted Republican in the past maybe voted for Trump in twenty sixteen and have voted for Democrats pretty strongly\nSend them out how are Republicans trying to protect these dirty it's\nTrying to do a couple of things at once and sometimes it's sort of an internally contradictory strategy the main thing they're trying to do is just disqualify Democrats that they're trying to\nThe strategy the main thing they're trying to do is just disqualify Democrats that they're trying to go into these suburban communities talked to white women talk to white men as well and say if you don't like the president you know fine but here's some things to be scared about about the Democrats\nResist he's demanding for when the ones who are listening to law enforcement agency that enforces for immigration laws America's doors to more flying\n[noise] and\nThese are voters in these districts who\nMight like a Democrat like a Joe Biden or even a Brock Obama mhm but they're not going to care for Bernie Sanders right they're not going to care for abolishing ice or certain kinds of rhetoric around national security or policing the use our\nRitzy white suburbs ride and a lot of the stereotypes that people think of tend to apply in these places\nYou've heard and pony oh Delgado is extreme in ... now do not oh admits he'd bring the same ideals to Congress\nThey're going on TV with these searing personal attack as looking at people's business records in one case a candidate background as a rapper it's just one of the most brutally personal negative campaigns I've ever seen in a midterm election\nIn Mexican millennial Democrat named mark ... doesn't get his support in the San Diego\nThe other side of it is that you see Republicans trying to put issues out there they get their own base excited so even in suburban district there are many voters who are enthusiastic about President Trump and twenty sixteen\nAnd many of them are less energized right now and the Democrats so what Republicans are trying to do at the same time if they talk to moderate and ...\nSo what Republicans are trying to do at the same time as they talk to moderate and say you can't trust the Democrats are the party of polo see there's a party of antifa at a party of abolish eyes they're also trying to talk to their own voters and remind them of the things that the president has done that they like\nConservative brand means getting the job done [noise] I'm twenty five dollars a call and thanks very city to stop illegal from taking on a fight alongside Trump implement his agenda and use conservative ... village on Wall\nThere's not really a great precedent for getting voters to show up just to say you know good job and I appreciate it so what you see Republicans doing in this case and Democrats did a little bit of this eight years ago\nIs trying to hammer home to the president's core supporters what a threat the opposition party is to him personally it's not just about policy as if you'll elect the opposition party they will try to impeach me they investigate me they will end to me as a really functioning government leader\nSo the strategy has not please thank me its nose at if houses lots of Democrats it will destroy it saved me [noise] so this sounds to me Alex harder for the Republicans then for the Democrats\nIs there a realistic version of this way the Democrats don't take back the has despite meeting just a third of the seats that you identify as somehow playing sure it's\nDefinitely harder for Republicans right now than it is for Democrats but you can see a scenario where Republicans hold the house and that probably involves conservative voters getting much more mobilized over the next month and Republicans can reach some of these suburban voters and sort of play with them to remember the in their hearts they're Republicans all along\nDo you expect Brett Kavanaugh to factor\nDo you expect Brett Kavanaugh to factor into the house races in a meaningful way and what would that look like in these suburban districts\nI'm going to give you a little bit of a we usually answer that I think he will matter and I think it's hard to say how\nYou probably will have conservative voters who are more tuned in now than they were a month ago because they got engaged and angry about the Supreme Court fight you probably also are going to have\nThose martyr white women who have been talking about it's not going to do them any favors with the Republican Party to have watched that fight unfold so I think the outcome in the house is ambiguous is much much clearer in the Senate and the story there is almost exactly the opposite of what we're seeing in the house [noise]\nWe'll be right back [noise]\n\nThe daily is supported by sleeping out barn featuring the new sleep number three sixty smart bed the sleeping out

take back the Senate\nThey need to gain two seats to take control of the chamber it's fifty one forty nine now a ... broken by the vice president though if Democrats gain one see Republicans still have control only two they only have to win to ... they need to gain two seats to win two seats Republicans hold and not lose any of their own okay\nSo how many races are there in the Senate\nOr either a Democrat could take a seat from Republican or Republican could take a seat from a Democrat they're ten races that were watching really closely right now most of them are in seats currently held by Democrats so it's really the mirror image of the house Democrats are mostly on defense\nOr six seats Democrats are defending where they're really at serious risk almost all of them are in states where President Trump won by a huge margin\nIn the states where President Trump won by a huge margin in twenty sixteen so you're talking about senators like Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota Claire McCaskill in Missouri Joe Donnelly in Indiana and these are people who are populist Democrats who are just running up a really big hill and Trump country right now\nIs there any shared story to what puts these three Democrats in danger in those three states you mentioned\nThe biggest forces are definitely national cultural forces but you're also talking about members of the Senate who\nStood with Brock Obama when he was passing a lot of liberal policy that was just not popular in these places there by and large people who've been strong supporters of the Affordable CARE Act back when it was unpopular of the Iran deal of cap and trade and there are people who have recently voted against the cabinet nominations\nHow are these three Democrats fighting for their seats given the voting record you just describe what's the case that they're making to their Trump supporting voters in these states\nMany of them are trying to align themselves with the president on a couple of key issues like trade\nMight know how hard northern ... wearing and that's why I'm fighting to open up foreign markets for nine and a lot of oil and to roll ... rules that hurt our farmers Heidi Heitkamp and I approve this message\nYou have mid western Democrats not just in Indiana but also in safer states for Democrats like Wisconsin and Ohio\nReally sort of cheering the president on as he confronts trading partners that Americans see has been devising them economically you see them trying to go after their Republican opponents as elitist and as hypocrites I'm Joe Donnelly and I approve this
