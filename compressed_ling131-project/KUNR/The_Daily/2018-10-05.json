{"month": "10", "state": "NV", "station": "KUNR", "content": "\n\n\n\nThe people in their neighborhood on one side of the street or only interview people from a certain period of their life you let the men and women and the FBI the professionals do their jobs\nAnd for people to some especially Democrats is starting to feel like a sham that pressure\nGets to be enough but the White House finally says that the president himself to the FBI can investigate that however they see fit\nI think they should interview anybody that they want within reason\nAnd they essentially give the green light to the FBI to go beyond just those poor people\n\nI mean like in the times since the investigation began\nThe public's focus and to some degree the Senate's focus has turned to Kavanaugh's credibility and his honesty during that hearing and the question of did he misrepresented passed in a way that should be concerning for potential Supreme Court justice\nDo we know if the FBI investigation has focused at all\nOn investigating his truth is our colleague Kelly and Robin Pogrebin\nTold us that a lot of Kavanaugh's classmates\nHave come forward and tried to reach the U.S [noise] to describe this behavior that they see as at odds with his death [noise] we drink beer and\n\nYou know so so did I think the vast majority of of people our age at the time but in any about one drink beer and and uh so so whatever you know\nEspecially when it comes to the string and some of them said they weren't quite sure how to reach the FBI and we're having trouble actually getting a hold of people at the FBI\nReached the FBI and we're having trouble actually getting a hold of people at the FBI so it seems like knowing whether the FBI has connected with them and bother to talk to them would be telling in knowing just how much the FBI is incorporating this question of truthfulness innocent as the Asian\nAnd I think we may not know until the reopen background check is officially completed and we see what the scope is that they've done as of now there is definitely evidence that suggests that a lot of the people who are wanting to come forward are struggling to feel like they're heard\nSome of them are being told to simply file reports an online Web portal which seems\nOne person described to me as sticking a needle back in the haystack that that whenever they're going to say isn't actually going to get to the right people in other cases there had been names that have been given directly to FBI agents directly involved in this inquiry and yet the people whose names have been given have not yet been\nCalled by the FBI and so\nWe don't know for sure whether there was a directive by the FBI to specifically focus on his honesty and whether or not he misled or lied or mischaracterized\nHimself during that testimony however keep in mind\nAll of this is intertwined all of this is related questions about his drinking could potentially affect how you decide whether or not he was truthful and denying the sexual misconduct right if a senator concludes hey he wasn't truthful about his drinking so therefore I don't believe his denials on the sexual misconduct\nYou could also see a situation in which a senator might say look I Believe his denials about the sexual misconduct I don't think he tempted to rape a woman I don't think he exposed\nAbout the sexual misconduct I don't think he tempted to rape a woman I don't think he exposed himself in a dorm room but I also think\nThat when he sat before us for several hours in the Senate Judiciary committee and downplayed his drinking and now I've looked at all these interviews and and I see the testimony of people saying the opposite and I don't believe him\nAnd just the fact that I Believe he misled the Senate committee could be enough for this particular senator or that particular senator to say I don't think he should be on the court because regardless of whether I think he committed sexual misconduct you want somebody on the court who's honest and I don't believe that that's that's the kind of thought process that a senator could go through\nSo this is not about getting a definitive answer about whether judge Kavanaugh assaulted Dr Fauci Ford or Deborah Ramirez\nRight it's about giving more information for the senators who will be making that determination uh the FBI is not going to include what the FBI is going to do is summaries of the interviews in the form\nThat is known at the FBI is a three oh two that's the interview form of all of these people will be ultimately delivered to the senators who will then be able to read them and\nUse the information as more grist in what they are going to ultimately have to do with just either yes or no on his nomination to the Supreme Court [laughter]\nSo senators will have access to the FBI and the city's three oh two forms will we as the public ever get to see them well\nThat's a good question and we don't know the answer to that normally the answer is no the FBI three oh two forms are not something that normally becomes public Senator McConnell the leader of the Republicans have said he doesn't expect them to become public\nUh we'll get an F ... it'll be made available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe daily is supported by home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of
