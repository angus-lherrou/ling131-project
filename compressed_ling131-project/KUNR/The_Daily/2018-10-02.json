grim faced staring down at the floor of the elevator trying not to sort of catch their gaze at one point one of the women\nProbably not to sort of catch their gaze at one point one of the women says\n\nLook at me don't look away when I'm Talking to you and he glances a craft following them and you can see the weight of this decision that he had already struggled with for the last week or more absolutely come crashing down on him\n\nIt was clear I think to everybody that watch that video that however difficult the decision had been for Senator Flake um though that moment it was immensely more difficult for him after that episode\nAnd respond [noise] same\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\nIn terms of having maximum impact it couldn't have been times better and it is certainly true that members of Congress get feedback all the time they get feedback from constituents that get phone calls that come into their offices so it's not true that they're completely isolated from what real people think\nBut there's also usually a distance right especially when you're at the Capitol when you're in Washington\nLawmakers sit up on the diet is in the hearing room they are both above the audience and distant from the audience and the discussions about public policy and these big momentous decisions they have to make are often done among themselves\nMomentous decisions they have to make are often done among themselves and out of the direct contact from the people that they're going to affect and this was a reminder for obviously Senator Flake but also for the rest of us watching it\nThat there really isn't as much distance as we think between the decisions that the politicians we elect to make and the people who they affect\nSo after when I'm sure felt like attorney to Senator Flake he sort of escapes this elevator the doors close and he heads into this year in\nWhat's going on in that room\nSo the hearing has just been gaveled to order by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa Republicans are assembling on one side of the diet Democrats are assembling on the other and all of them are settling in for what they expect to be a kind of pre determined outcome\nEach senator on each side gets a few minutes to participate in so Senator Grassley recognize Senator Dianne Feinstein she made some comment\nThank you Mr Chairman I I'm very disappointed that we're here today voting on this nomination and then it went to a Republican senator\nAnd the more than twelve years a judge Kavanaugh has been a judge on the DC circuit his reputation for honesty courtesy and integrity\nAnd then it went to a democratic senator it goes back and forth each appointment to our nation's highest court as with all others is simply too important to rush to vote\nBut even as the back and forth is happening the Democrats are leading for some kind of a delay\nYou investigate it\nThe delay you investigate gets the least thing a sexual assault victim is entitled to when she comes forward\nThey don't understand why are the FBI investigation\nCould you take place and I have conveyed to my friends and colleagues that I had wished we would take a one week pause one week only\nChris Coons of Delaware suggests that a one week FBI investigation could help provide some clarity and the Republicans are essentially rejecting that out of hand\nSix FBI investigations and we miss the sophomore junior gang rapist witness that much garbage\nThere's nothing that the FBI would do that the committee hasn't already\nHeard we made a decision to vote or one thirty if there's some reason to change that and we'll have to change it but I I'm not even getting a discussion about that right now fair enough and then what [noise]\nPoint Senator Flake gives up from his seat and walked behind the day is behind the other senators that are talking any taps Chris Coons the senator from Delaware a democratic senator from Delaware tabs on the shoulder and indicates that he wanted to talk to him they walk through a pair of double doors behind\nThe committee diets and they go private we back behind into an anti regime is behind a committee chambers people watching on television\nThe other senators are noticing this but don't quite know what is going on\nAnd the other senators are noticing this but don't quite know what is going on behind closed doors here's what was happening\nSenator Flake and senator tuned to our friends they've known each other a long time they trust each other\nThey're the kind of friends in the Senate that are more genuine it's not just the my friend on the other side of the aisle Senator Flake says to senator Coons I'm having second thoughts I think your idea about a week delay to give the FBI time might actually be possible but I'm nervous she says\nAnd so what follows is absolutely a remarkable scene where suddenly this conversation between these two men becomes much larger senator ... goes out and get some of his Democratic colleagues come in and continue the conversation behind closed doors\nSenator Tom tell us and North Carolina Senator John Cornyn of Texas to Republicans they also come in over the next forty five minutes or so you have virtually every member of the committee back in this small cramped\nHallway behind the committee room and what's happening is Senator Flake is essentially standing\nPretty much silence according to the people who describe the scene\nAs he's surrounded on both sides by these two warring political factions so the Republicans on the committee senator tell us than Senator Cornyn are arguing strenuously you can't do this this would be terrible it's going to allow for the judge's wife even more Chris Coons and the Democrats are\nTrying to cope him along saying look you know this is what the Senate that's about it about compromise it's about\nFinding a way forward without\nJamming something through for political purposes it got very heated as it was described to us and all of it with Senator Flake\nIt was described to us and all of it with Senator Flake coming even more anxious was he going to reverse themselves and essentially put the brakes on what had been just moments before to be a foregone conclusion um\n\nWe'll be right back the daily it's supported by penguin Random House audio dedicated to producing top quality audio books Christina Dodgers vox the
