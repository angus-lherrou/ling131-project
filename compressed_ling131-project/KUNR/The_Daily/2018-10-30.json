{"month": "10", "state": "NV", "station": "KUNR", "content": "And what happened on Saturday So from what we know on Saturday morning he got into his car and drove to the synagogue and at nine forty nine AM he went on to gab and posted a final message\nAnd he wrote I Can't sit by and watch by people get slaughtered screw your optics I'm going in\n\nAnd then we know that about five minutes later a nine one one call came in was reporting an active shooting in the synagogue he carried for guns with him according to police and as he entered he shouted that he wanted all Jews to die and began shooting\nWhat do we know about this man we know\nAnd shooting\nWhat do we know about this man we know that Robert Bowers is forty six years old\nHe lives about half an hour south of the synagogue in a kind of rundown apartment and according to our colleagues at the times who have talked to his neighbors and gone to his apartment\nHis neighbors said they don't really know much about him they don't remember him talking to anyone they don't remember him having much of a social life at all he doesn't have a lot of footprints\nOther than on line and most of what we know about him at this point we know because he had this account on ...\nOn now for our defending the first series where we expose the enemies of the first amendment free expression and free thought\nIf you remember a few years ago there started to be this narrative about censorship by Silicon Valley tech companies\nThat many Research Center released a devastating report today documenting the censorship of conservative speech by silicon valley's tolerant tech giants\nAnd especially through Twitter and Facebook being accused of bias against conservatives\nAnd gab sort of came out of that controversy was started by a conservative programmer in Silicon valley who was sort of set up with what he saw as excessive political correctness so he started this website\nAnd as a result of the fact that it had very few rules there were no rules against hate speech they weren't doing a ton of\nOf censorship is pretty much anything goes a lot of the more prominent people who joined where people who had been kicked off of other platforms lever being too extreme and\nAll of these people flocked there because gab would allow them\nAll of these people flocked there because gab would allow them to say pretty much whatever they wanted their other people and gab to obviously they have something like seven hundred thousand members\nBut the most visible stuff on the site was always the kind of shocking racist anti Semitic far right content that was being shoved off of more popular platforms\nAnd what about ... hours what have you been able to learn from his postings on gab well he\nJoined the site in January and we've been able to recover some of his posts they've been taken down but we have an archive of some of them\nAnd going through them it's sort of gives you the impression that he was obsessed with anti Semitism I mean substantially all of the posts\nThat he posted and re posted were about Jews were about conspiracy theories about Jews controlling the world he was critical of President Trump because he thought that President Trump was too accommodating of ...\nSo this was powers Kevin really making use of gab as it was designed to be used as a far more lenient platform than Twitter then Facebook ... right\nBefore this shooting we had another act of domestic terrorism which was this male bombing bomb sent through the mail to prominent Democrats and news organizations like CNN and the suspect in that case this guy from Florida Caesar say Iraq\nHe also use social media to post sort of extreme and divisive content but he didn't have a different way he was using Facebook and Twitter which are kind of the big mainstream platforms\nHe was using Facebook and Twitter which are kind of the big mainstream platforms and he was using them to get into fights and attack people and engage people who he disagreed with and that was sort of the appeal of that service to him was that everyone was there and you can find his enemies and communicate directly with them\nWhereas Robert Bowers seems to have flocked to gab for the opposite reason because that was where the people who agreed with him or and that was where he could find a community of people who shared his views who he could communicate openly with without sort of the watchful eye of the platform getting in the way\nKevin you and I have talked about the fact that social media sites like Facebook and Twitter need to be stronger about policing this sort of speech that we're talking about\nBut I Wonder if your concern that what we're seeing here with gab\nMight be a consequence of that any crackdown at all has pushed to people with more extreme views\nOn to a smaller and less public and more fringe the social media sites where inevitably there's less oversight and also more people who hold equally extreme or more extreme perspective and is that a problematic outcome\nI think one thing that we do know for sure is that when people get kicked off of Twitter and Facebook and other large social media platforms they don't just stop posting they don't go away they find some place else that will tolerate them more turn a blind eye\nAnd I think we have to get comfortable with the reality that one of the trade offs of having ... our biggest and most influential social\n... of having ... our biggest and most influential social platforms be healthier and less toxic is that a lot of the worst stuff is going to get pushed into these smaller\nMore private enclaves and there might not be any way to avoid that even if it shuts down even if something else takes its place\nKevin what have you been thinking as you've been reporting on all this over the weekend because it feels like for many months we've been talking about the divisions on social media\nMostly in terms of politics what they meant in twenty sixteen what they might mean for the midterms\nBut it feels like the events of the past week had sort of exploded that idea that the stakes are actually far higher\nWe're talking not about how this divisiveness might affect people's votes but about how it's getting into people's psyche is and is doing unbelievable\nWe'll we'll damage yeah I think for the last several months I've been covering social media with a focus on what affect all of this behavior happening on social media would have on one set of elections\nAnd when I'm realizing is that it's far far bigger than that because what we're really seeing is the kind of breakdown of the dividing line between\nOnline bad behavior and real world violence is for a while lots of people thought that because threats or abusive language were happening\nOn the Internet and it was somehow less real that it was less threatening to receive a death threats on Twitter than it would be to\nLess threatening to receive a death threat on Twitter than it would be to receive it over the phone or ... percent right\nAnd I think now we know that that's just not true that often this stuff is one in the same that the threats and the conflict and the polarization that erupt on line and in the media\nCan bleed over into real world violence and are doing it pretty frequently and in in ways that are horrifying the consequences of all of this of this stirring up of anger and hatred and polarization I think we're going to be with us for a long time\n\n\nTerrible terrible thing what's going on\nIn our country frankly it all over the world [noise]\nAnd something has to be done something has to be done\nOver the weekend President Trump denounced the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh even as the death ruled by questions about what signals he has sent intentionally or not to extremist across the country\nHave you ever asked him to please not use that type of language when referring to other people for the case of civil discourse in this country everyone has their own style and frankly people on both sides of the aisle use strong language about our political differences\nBut those around the president including vice president Mike Pence rejected any linkage between Trump's language and the acts of isolated extreme in but\nI just don't think you can connect it to threats are acts\nElated extreme in\nBut I just don't think you can connect to the threats are acts of violence on and I don't think the American people can aren't in the American people believe that those who are responsible or are the people that actually conduct the stress\n\nWe'll be right back\nThe daily supported by babble a language that teachers real life conversations in a new language like Spanish French German battles ten to Fifteen minute
