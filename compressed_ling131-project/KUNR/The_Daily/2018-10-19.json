you're going to have how much of it is pre programmed how much of it maybe another surprise has his work\nWell you you know you make reservation you you come sit down and see for the most part the lineup that's posted on the Internet and then quite often they're a drop ins of famous people certainly can't count on it mhm but it happens regularly through the week\nAnd just tell me exactly what a what a drop in it or somebody like a Chris Rock or Chappelle or somebody will be in town\nAnd you know comedians they need\nAn audience to work out their material it's not like any other like a musician can sit home and record and practice or almost any other art form you can find a way to do it yourself but stand up comedy only exist in front of an audience right so I kind of live interaction well you get a job only works if people less mhm so the audience here comes\nThinking maybe I Want to hear this comedian that comedian two or three and all of a sudden Chris Rock Jerry Seinfeld whoever drops in tests out their material transforms the night yeah [noise]\nTest out their material transforms the night yeah [noise] so tell me if you what about the night of August twenty six just a few weeks ago where were you died I was I was actually in bed and I didn't find out about it till the next morning tell me about it what what exactly happened\nHe came down he performed really yeah and when I woke up in the morning I saw a text message St Louis here after the fact yeah and what did you find out what happened\nWas that he had a notebook he did is that apparently it was a notebook that he'd been using the last week that he done comedy prior to this and he just I think decided I'm just going to\nPick up where I left off and do you know how he was introduced kind of how the roughly what words were used in the audience reacting what's your record in ... the the hosts something like you know uh\nI'm actually really excited there's no need for an introduction you know this guy as we've grown up from everybody [noise]\nLadies German you know the guy from his show [noise] please make welcome Louis seeking something like that you know there was no\nAnd\nDo you know how the audience responded and that you [noise]\n\nYou know any of the examples of a joke he tried out during his performance yet that parades about tipping waitresses that what is it just that we're not very startled and Mrs\nIn a way that this will be constructed in the media and correct me if it's wrong he he does a familiar routine he does is that that is classic K. he mentions whistles\nClass of ... he mentions whistles and one of the things he mentions is a joke about a rape whistle so it sounds like classical we see Cate despite the fact that those kinds of jokes have a different entirely different residents\nWe I don't mean she was tuned in says that the joke was about his daughter said some that you know that not all whistle for clean what about the expression clean as a whistle and so we started talking about different with all this kind of with all that ... rape whistle that don't so clean and that led wasn't a rape joke by any means\n... that sounds like there was a performance that did not address what I Would regard as the elephant in the room they didn't address it\n\nIsn't nice line\nComedian Louis the case to pry their parents had a comedy club just months after admitting to allegations of sexual misconduct\nThere was no threat to women were the one\nNight eating out firestorm to not have the right thing to do that anymore and the era of the me too movement why some say it's too soon [noise]\nWhen did you realize that this was going to be a a big deal\nLike a lot of hate mail I got threats of violence really I mean what was the content of those kinds of threats were they were going to fire bombed the club things like that a scary\nCan I ask you know as this criticism is coming in\nYou identifying what you like meaningful criticisms and push back yeah and and but limited in what are they yes some of the people felt ambushed mhm you know you can imagine you wait all week to go out\nMhm you know you can imagine you wait all week to go out to a comedy club on Saturday Night and ...\nAnd you walk into something which really really upsets you and you're angry at the place for doing that so what I've done to\nAnswer that is that we have a very clear policies son she says swim at your own risk we don't know who's going to pop in ... if somebody pops and not to your liking you can leave no questions asked you your check is on the house we don't want him such as\nSo nobody can say there were a captive audience which would infuriate me to other people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy said he's a comedian\nAnd I'm like okay when do you think he could come work yeah he's like\nNever mhm might never he says never\nI said well could you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence never work again he says I don't care and never this is an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the harvest place what you would say\nParticularly to a female customer who was somebody else on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton who is credibly obviously accused in Juanita broader I mean I think nobody will expect a warning before he shows up somewhere\nNobody\nLike why were they sharing Roman Polanski as they were for years why were they giving standing ovations ... director accused of sexually abusing a yacht accused ... he did it but behind all these people you're mentioning Roman Polanski the film director Bill Clinton the president Louis became a comedian\nIs someone who gives them a stage and in this case that's you rub on had nobody cares that Mike Tyson who raped or convicted of raping somebody\nCares that Mike Tyson who raped or convicted of raping somebody performs looking only control the venue you control yes but but it's not unusual to\nExpect some consistency in the world and when you see wildly inconsistent demands if it's so obvious that the guy who Nasser baited in front of women and expose itself and women should never work again but it sounds like you're saying\nWhy should I Know I'm the owner of comedy cellar knew something out of the normal way of warning an audience\nWhy should I be from now when I'm warning you know and I said that but even though I Will do that do not expect people to the warning people outside of Bill Clinton's and that's what I'm saying I don't want my customers upset but the overlay this entire moral structure on it\nAnd they presented as if don't you understand how the world works mhm and I I look around that there was the last you know that's not the way\nThe world work in the world very much picks and chooses so I have two ways to handle it I can either get involved in that ends on this person can perform this person you can reform and explain to them well how come you lead norm go on and you ... you know I'm going to become a hypocrite overnight mhm or\nI told the audience this and this is the comedy cellar it's unfiltered and\nWe don't want you here not understanding that it's not the end of the world to see somebody that you don't like or that to you know you know but if it is in the world for some people it may be based on their their traumas in their own life are the
