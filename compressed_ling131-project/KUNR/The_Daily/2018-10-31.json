{"month": "10", "state": "NV", "station": "KUNR", "content": "A radical leftist Marxist bomber and a ... banker that Jews were\nBoth nibbling cowards and all powerful puppet masters\nThat you could be anything to anybody just as long as it's bad and all that stuff that seemed you know ... not the may be coming during the ... air of Russia but just the past right the United states was the land of the free\nThis was a backward looking world that American Jews had left Germany Russia this was not America\n[noise] it feels like you're surprised sort of mirrors our collective surprise over the past two years that\nAnti Semitism had felt like an an American problem and suddenly it was then once you saw in your own in boxing and your Twitter feed and you're a voice mail I Wonder where else did you begin to see it\nYou know you get your antenna up and suddenly as the twenty sixteen presidential campaign really kicked into gear mhm I started seeing it everywhere\nAre you familiar with this mean called Pepe the frog and\nOne of the people who caught on to that sort of pet they raised with Donald Trump junior who had a thing for re tweeting a lot of neo Nazi interestingly enough on Twitter he posted this on September tenth and there's ... right in the middle of the show solidarity with the ... right\nRight with white supremacy we've gone from dog whistle\nRight with white supremacy we've gone from dog whistles to fall on barking\nAnd because I knew it I could see things out there in the campaign that other people would just go right by I mean we're in there was a moment where\nDonald Trump is facing backlash over this tweet that included the star of David the tweet shows the Jewish symbol over images of Hillary Clinton and dollar bills the message over the star says most corrupt candidate ever\nA lot of people said wait a minute that's a Jewish star this must be an anti Semitic reference\nMegan the debate boils down to whether or not you think a big sided star looks more like a star of David or a sheriff badge\nThen they tell me how do these silly that's the share a star but because I was trolling around looking\nAt the images on these alt right websites I knew exactly when they had gotten that it wasn't some innocent thing they didn't stumble into what they went looking for that image and somehow thought that was a good thing to send out [noise]\n\nAnd then the final campaign that candidate Trump ran his closing statement for the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nPolitical establishment with the new government controlled by the American people\nWas this dark dark at that spoke of global special interests coming after America\nThose who controls the levers of power\nAnd for the global specialist a partner with you\nEspecially a partner with these people\nAnd as they ran these words global special interests you saw the Jewish faces of Janet Yellen the Federal Reserve chairman of Lloyd Blankfein the chairman of Goldman Sachs and of George Soros the Jewish philanthropist ... three Jewish images\nComing on top of those words global special interests it was just hard to mistake\nAnd we will take back this country for you and we will make America great again [noise]\nI'm Donald Trump and I approve this message\nBut I guess they're still kind of a plausible deniability perhaps to something like that and the Trump campaign whenever they were called on it by reporters always said you're seeing things that aren't there\nThat's right and remember the plausible deniability always came from the palace men that is a bunker Trump\nYou think the president does not like using a prejudiced against you think about the president of the United states you bet and you know I don't think I while I was like having to you know why they hate it thought the Haley\nThey say what wait a minute Donald Trump has a Jewish daughter Ivanka he has his son in law who's an Orthodox Jew he has Jewish grandchildren how dare you accuse him of anti Semitism\nSo what is it for though if the president does have a Jewish daughter and Jewish grandchildren entered Jewish son in law how do we understand what you're describing a kind of ...\nJewish son in law how do we understand what you're describing a kind of unmistakable appeals to anti Semitism in an ad like this being present in the campaign\nI think Donald Trump had a very hard time turning his back on his most ardent supporters he and his campaign understood that they had really riled up the far right the alt right and that included races that included an anti Semite\nI'm not going to choose them of racism or anti Semitism but I Will say that when confronted with the darker sides of his supporters he was always very reluctant to denounce them to push them away\nAnd that in your mind is just purely\nAbout an electoral\nCalculation by the president by those around them\nIn my mind I Do not think that Donald Trump feels like he can waste or lose a single vote\nSo for me Jonathan as someone who did not have the kind of\nAwakening that you did because of what happened to you on Twitter there was talk of anti Semitism during the campaign but it often felt a little ambiguous and I actually remember vividly when that change\n[noise]\n\nHe was ... it was a white nationalist\nThat seemed like it was about race but suddenly you had all these young white man [noise] marching in unison and chanting [noise]\nThing [noise]\nRight [noise]\n\nNews will not replace [noise] and I remember being truly confused by that chance like why are white nationalist talking about ... it did not make a whole I sensed\nIt made a lot of sense why\nBecause there is kind of a hand the on of evil in the old right in this new breed of\nNeo Nazis and in the pantheon the watch word is white genocide that they believe that the white race is being supplanted replaced watered down\nAnd they also believe that the white race is superior to Latinos to blacks to anyone who is not white right ten remembered Jews in their mind or not white\nBut they look around them and they say well wait a minute if we're the superior race how could it be that these brown skinned black skinned people are succeeding in white genocide are replacing us and that's where they look for the\nPuppet master and they find the Jews the Jews in the ... world\nAre the ones who are orchestrating the white genocide maybe not the field troops the shock troops have white genocide or brown skinned black skin but the orchestra raiders of white genocide are Jews that's why Jews will not replace us\nSo what's the connection why are Jews now seen as the puppet tears of Syrians ...\nWho's now seen as the puppet tears of Syrians Mexicans et cetera\nWell you know one of the central tenets of Judaism is remember this stranger for you or a stranger in the land of Egypt\nIt is actually part of the religion to welcome strangers to welcome immigrants are welcome refugees and actually American Jews really created the concept of repairing the world to tune alone\nThis kind of welcoming response to the stranger extended to the Nineteen fifties to African Americans who were then storing the civil rights movement\n[noise]\nI Love the rabbi all the Jewish community in but later on down the regime\nI learned many things\nThat most important thing that I learned in my life\nIs that bigotry and hatred\nI Know the most ... problem\nThen adjunct disgraceful demos shame for the most tragic problem is filing\nThe civil rights movement was a seminal moment for Jewish and black alliances\n\nAnd yeah and that has tremendous resonance to Jews and two of fighters and civil rights and it also has tremendous residence for the alt right who always the Jews somewhere in the background orchestrating their demise", "show_name": "The Daily", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "31"}
