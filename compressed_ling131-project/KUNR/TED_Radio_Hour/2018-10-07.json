responsible drinking and from the any each Casey foundation gets\nThe Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj and I'll show today ideas about who we are what makes us us\nAnd we've been talking to ... who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans you are you're basically talking like super heroes right like perfect vision\nSuperhuman strength perfect SAT scores right those are the yoga I think that's that's the science fictional vision of what\nCRISPR could aware [noise] we have long\nLists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated\nPerson [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leader muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology that could in theory you allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the ... version if it seems like that that technology is a promising like if it was a in a way to make a child more resilient to pan or or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select to trade still inherit from the parents something we can already do\nStreets still inherit from the parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or that disease prevention is you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes easier five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping during that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up ending that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt so I think this comes down to the question of of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted\nSomething that should remain untouched on tainted left alone of course where we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this\nVery radio issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nOr being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off\n... ... ...\n... is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and I think of all power to control an illusion you can check out his attack at ... dot com\n\nOn today's show we're asking a very important question is\nOkay like you have the answer dino who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] I I have an uh an inkling of who we are as Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature\nSet of ... what what is it that makes us who we are well it [noise]\nMakes us who we are\nWell it [noise] there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a\nFabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equipment us with a set of motives and emotions and other mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just fed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with this okay I'll do my best\nOkay just to get us started human beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors\nAre either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker ... stage back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and I meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from the historian was going to take a godsend man has no instinct and the anthropologist fast we want to do the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to not from\nHochul a scientist Stephen J gold ... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number of political reasons why people have found congenial foremost there but I get more blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the plate and some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political sphere of human nature is that\nIf we were blanks place we can perfect mankind angel dream of the perfect ability of our species to social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly interesting and perhaps some of them like Dennis To selfishness prejudice and violence [noise]\nFirst of all there are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate and some of them just come from a common sense as many people have told me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperament and talented\nDoesn't all come from the outside oh and anyone who uh\nA child and a house that I certainly noticed that the child exposed speech full acquire a human language whereas the house that won't presumably because of some innate difference between them and [noise] anyone has ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men in the minds of women are not indistinguishable\nSo for years that debate about nature versus nurture has been jets\nHere's the debate about nature versus nurture has been just that that debate it's one or the other but Steven Pinker has mainly argued that this\nShouldn't be a debate that who we are comes down to both our genes and our environment it's a mistake to think that uh if\nThere is in effect of the environment that shows that were blanks weights or conversely if there is such a thing as human nature than we are our robots and we're programmed to a or walk into walls and be completely insensitive to our

what it means to be conscious like why is it [noise] consciousness is\nThe most familiar saying for any of his name we all know the difference between being conscious and not being conscious\nThis is an out fast he's a professor of neuroscience at the University of sex in the u._k.\nConsciousness is any kind of experience at all whether it's a visual experience with the world around us whether it's an emotional\nExperience of feeling sad or jealousy or happy or excited or from the experiences of intending to do something or being the cause is something that happens consciousness is the word that we use to sex inscribed\nAll the different kinds of experiences that that we can have [noise]\nI think pretty much sympathy for conscious system there is something it is like to be that system whereas for something that isn't conscious [noise] better than [noise]\nAnd how consciousness even happens and if we can recreate it artificially it's a question that we're still trying to figure out because what's more fundamental about being a human then knowing we exist\n[noise] and I'll ...\nHuman then knowing we exist [noise] an al ... explains more from the pet stage [noise]\nLast spring this question is so important because consciousness for each of us is all there is without fifth as well\nAs myself there's nothing at all and when we suffer we suffer consciously whether it's three mental illness or pain and if we can experience joy and suffering what about other animals\nMight they be conscious she did they say have a sense of self and ask them she says get faster and smarter maybe they'll come a point maybe not too far away when my iPhone develops a sense of it saying existence now I actually think the prospects for conscious I pretty much\nIn the store I'm going to tell you our conscious experiences of the world around us and about films within it\nAll kinds of control to these nations that happened with free and the causal all living voting [noise]\n\nUm I Love this idea of a controlled ... nation\nIs is that is that what we experience is that how we experience the world that it's\nIt's a control to loose nation we are just essentially hallucinating all the time\nI Love this rise I Wish I could take credit for it but but I Can't but I Love the fries because\nIt points out that everything that we perceive consciously or unconsciously but let's talk about consciousness for now is a construction of the bright I mean it's easy to think that we are in our eyes and objective reality is revealed to us ... through the windows of our eyes again what conscious perception is is basically just\nIn somebody's sitting inside us go looking out there and they see a red table they pass in ... well gained\nLooking out there and they see a red table they send you a passing\nA law again there's batter writers ahead\nThe real reality [noise]\n\nThat's right but the truth is that both perceptions are acts of interpretation that act of informed guesswork that the brain appliance encounters sensory data I think that the way I Can't think of this is is that there is no light in the skull and it's nice sounds that\nWas going on in the brain or electrical impulses whizzing around and complex pop in and out of all the oldest passing much in the in the brain ...\nAppears [noise]\nAnd in some sense we we've known this for a long time since meats and it's been pretty clear that colors red yellow green seven colors and no objective properties of objects in the world they are attributes\nOf of reflected light and and the brain the visual system will make inferences based on wavelengths of light and about what color or something is\nA ... something as basic as color is not something that we just passively receive from the world we activity attribute\nIt to things out there on the world and the idea of control to the nation is is just that well this applies to everything and this applies to everything that we perceive and not just perceptions of things out there in the world but also it applies to our perceptions about self\nAbout Bodie about memories of a sense of agency about sensitive election that every\nThing that we see is a construction but it's it's not a random construction its construction\nIs a construction but it's it's not a random construction as construction that's a best guess but it rained in by the
