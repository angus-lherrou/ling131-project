have a face for TV not right now that is true this is ... she's a standup comedian I'm slurry and everyone thinks I'm drunk [laughter]\nNow the reason why may soon as a little self conscious about doing radio is because I'm a disability she has which in her stand up routine she tackles head on here she is on the stage\nAnd I am not drunk but they\nMe was he called my\nThinks different\nIn six

the audience and you saw it live young the so called so when you came out and you started to talk of the audience was like kind of uncomfortable right because you\nYou were talking about how you shake like ... and and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire\nYou know massive room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially\nI Do naturally because men stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy I was ... New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian\nWith me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is I I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I Move on and a strong funny relate of away people are able to move on with me\nBecause I think for for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's a comfortable like we're not used to that do you think so because\nI mean this really has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television this millions made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bullied when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pain don't walk but my parents didn't believe in can't my father's monitor what you can do and yet you can can [noise]\n\nIf my three older sisters we're mopping I was often if my three older sisters went to public school my parents went through the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aid we all got my mother slipper [noise]\n\nFather taught me and I walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just\nBy placing my heels on his feet and just walking I Know they tactic that he used this he would dangle a dollar bill in\nFront of me I have we have [laughter] my inner server was very strong and [laughter]\nBy\nI was walking like a champion who had been punched one too many times\nTo so when you were a kid I mean for ... you described like but up until the age of five you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk out fine but I had to be able to walk in order to be made streamed into public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning really no\nOne was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg and when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she use comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are\nMy TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior you know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were\nNot typically beautiful possibly had disability you know had different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm hysterical [laughter]\nYou know it's it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons right or their challenges through humor right in\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well I've\nNever tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and justify telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven in New York City\nMy friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happened to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just wanted to talk about beyond say I'm I named my cat beyond and people are like\nAbout guys are talking about several probably talked about you know like ...\nTalk about all the talk about you know I'm like I really just want to talk about beyond say the cat [laughter] so it gets exhausting having to constantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life it's important now that I Do battle because having grown up\nWith you know one fight in Jersey and one foot in the middle East I'm really worried\nAbout where we are right now in this country and when I did that Ted Talk I didn't know how important it was to say a Muslim in front of every one I really thought it was the disability that was going to be the thing that I was championing\nGrowing up there were only six Arabs in my town and they were all my family now there are twenty hours in town and they are still my family [noise]\nI don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian [laughter]\n[noise] this\nJust live journalism event is about the

comedian again for ... and she in a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they were trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required to little patient\n[laughter] yeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nSo that trip and again took was the other comedians they turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming in too long after he came up something happened back in New York a place where again usually felt welcomed than accepted\nAnd group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the NCAA that's the New York city subway system\nMoslem poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be bigoted you might as well use a better font but\nNot to watch her own poster campaign right the nice things about my lungs so myself\nComedian dino be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign we raised money work with the NCAA for over five months got approved and today\nWe're supposed to go up a the NCAA decided to be the poster citing political content let's take\nAt a couple of those posters here is one of them can do more Muslims [noise] let's\nGreat for recipe\nFor us are considered political by the MTA that or the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we decided\nTo change our fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign and try to the fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBags comedians took on a major in New York City agency and the comedians one [noise]\nA very weird feeling I was like a blonde girls feel like all the time\nWork is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me\nEmail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or don't kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but just changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nSo you talk a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment in the film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful yeah so I mean you know when I first talked with in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called me about religion\nWe're going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was all\nNew Testament or the Koran\nDoes your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous prize is like an outdated calendar salivating already and\nRules are salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that which holy book stipulate for the girl who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death or because\nOf her own it is the\nMan [noise] people guessed wrong on because they just assumed everything that was the violin um came from the Koran Mary\nLord how can I have a son when no man has touched me\nAnd I don't we just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half crazy stuff in them so why would we hold Islam to a separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my gosh\nAnd you could see them having that moment of like oh my God you know a lot of difference between the three of them do you know [noise] it's incredible that I mean that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nThe American people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off you are a coffee and they wanna open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get love and return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslims thing performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found a way I like to look at it as you\nYou got one person to live in a couple of you will laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people ... and those chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular um shift in perception\nAnd that is social change but it takes time and it takes like millions of these chuckle [noise]\nComedian again first she's the author of how to make white people\nAnd she also hosts a podcast called the the nation you can find her full talk to dot com [noise]\nI'm sure it's very painfully funny\nOn the show today painfully

comedian\nRelations users these that are [noise]\nHe's actually read since she's ... she's ready for him though [noise]\nHouse event it was hard it is [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is like Kevin does for a living\nBut being funny\nIs also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation or\nA shield like you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young person\nWhen I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas thoughts in stories that\nMight otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning\nIt was more of a shield than an invitation\nI was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and felt like I was shattered in just a million different pieces I mean it's like kind of ...\nFelt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean that's like kind of grief that to this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuated in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in\nWaves and you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark helpless place\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly minimum wage I didn't want people to see that I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight of shame and embarrassment and killed\nKevin briel tells his
