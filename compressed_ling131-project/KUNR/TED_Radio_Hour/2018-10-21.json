it just suddenly struck me why I just go home and start to do things differently I got an a train and I just made up incredible edible [laughter] and it was a really simple model really simple um it was just like see my gym wherever we live in a ... a neighborhood our town a village whatever what is it any scale\nWe planted edible landscapes everywhere that we could you just could like empty lots and just start planting stuff that you leave once you plant food right um and then we've got picked up the show people what's growing that\nFor the tide radio our comes from Amazon Web services used

change so much\nAbout the way we live I just bought a bottle of water and on the label is head gluten free interesting\nWell and it is [laughter] for his food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marketing describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat have become staples of the western diet\nThing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government's through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time planted in one crop an endless rows that are all\nCultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century it was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer\nI think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown and now I Know it was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nWe got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the troops there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\n'cause all who can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there\nMost bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or\nThe stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew\nThey became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either some of us reading and good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat\nAnd spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home at the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden\nSo now you got here pizza night so you got your microwave lights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the various stuff that will kill you\nGet ... and ... like what you were saying earlier ally that has to do it with the fact that like we think we should food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this can go back to cooking because\nOne of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking it\nIs abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need to everything but you you are a guy that a lot of people look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of luck that men and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWell I Do think you know I did this book called the ... going before six or\nA few years ago and um\nBasically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever but I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know or the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because that are broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules you eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOverconsumption of animals and of course John food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there is no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that class and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients in plants it's the plants it's not the\nBeta carotene it's the carrots the evidence is very clear\nThat plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming of this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer\nNot bad\nYou live longer not bad but back\nAnimals and junk food we don't need either of them for health boats have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not born craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for every one that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path\nYou [noise]\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at ... dot com um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I tell you the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next ... who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago was that pasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs\nRe ... the great use of sardines great how can you not eat pasta ... you can get sweet potatoes pasta which is which isn't Haley of kind of um uh I don't think Boston's gonna kill ya\nMarket menacing that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but they had to estimate\nGrocery stores isn't real food but but if you had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate it's Seventy four percent I Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] is it [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nThis is Dr Robert Lustig he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco so there are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know ... it was shown on digital them or are that's even has the most famous now\nApple puree or evaporated change yeah my favorite because cages so you know juice healthy right what happens when you evaporate changes you get [noise] sugar\nRobert Lustig studies sugar how it's managed to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they processed food diet because it's cheaper it's portable it's convenient kids like it and it's addictive\nAnd like any addictive substance Robert says sugar can be toxic especially because so many of us eat too much of it has Robert less taken on the stage\nDoes sugar cause diabetes or everyone says well yeah but it's because of the calories sugar empty calories\n\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from life luck life luck with Norton works to help protect identities and the information on devices from cyber

taste food and ... and yet that's an illusion in the sense that uh most of what you're tasting the fruit you the ... the boon to the smoky are actually being because you bought nostrils but operations wonderful ... and\nThe information I get from my nose and makes me believe 'cause if it's coming from I ...\nThis is Charles Spence a head of the ... research liberal tree Oxford University what is the cross metal research laboratory [noise]\nUm ... having the psychology department where we look at how the census interact\nAnd yes our mouth and nose interact when we eat\nAnd yes our mouth and nose interact when we eat the mouse and our ears\nAre we doing experiments where we're feeding people up potato chips and each time they put it into a potato chip we would change the sound that they could sometimes making their own crunching ...\nSometimes quiet sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel show you that as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas to crunch the freshness or these other attributes that\nCharles how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might call a white wine artificially ... within ... tasteless food dye\nAddict and appropriately you'll find the experts the winemakers will get fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think is a red wine [laughter] all the ... the tobacco and the top chocolates in the state and fruit since I don't even know what they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about ingredients here's Charles Spence on the head stage\nThis morning to I'll tell you about the perfect meal rural convinced we can taste the food we can enjoy the flavors and aromas of the wind and the glass\nReflects little what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question is how to study how the measure is I'm a tendency among the scientists that been your guest strong as it does take people like your eye and a brain scanner give them something to eat something to drink and see which parts of the brain light up to that kind of your brain on flavor or New York astronomy\nRunning is one problem here which is that in fact you mentioned something about it\nOne problem here which is in fact when the mattress off one of the brain scan is lying on your back where they had climbed stale with Cuban your marriage\nThat periodically square sin ah some drink you call it can be full of your head all kind of a jolt and that ... that the brain scan alignment but it's kind of tells you something to do something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal and one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\nI must say it's probably a different for each and every one of us make some very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as as best meals but ... would I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining a I have no one has ever had that perfect meal when the fighting with up hot in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with doesn't resonate in the end and you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed fewer holiday less stressed Tripoli with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met a friend who's just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red line that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were thinking\nIt that phenomenon has a name that we've all learned versions of its um I was going to problem solve rose a paradox instead use to describe a northern Europeans um but to kill the guy for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nOr not sitting somewhere on a on the side of the sea sipping that arose they wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\nSuffering that arose they wind up looking into that love his eyes\n... they can hear the sounds of the sea smells associates all laugh and not tasteless like the best glass of wine you've ever had\nSo great that you want to buy a Baltimore case and bring it back to share with your friends and chocolate could taste you have an ... or you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed\nAnd your friends are like this is really cheap ... yeah I understand what happened is it something about when the buttons when they're playing with a cold and I you know sport the wind things not about a tool we never eat or drink no we're always\nSomewhere in a certain environments in certain states would mind\nOn all mental state and the environment both together that kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile anyway some myths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation\nAnd put some of that pleasure into what we think about the food\n[noise] in fact says Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nIn a good mood food tastes good if you're in a bad mood I never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but I'll bring everything else the sound of a single the smell of a salty sea or the warmth of the songs on our backs all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chef capturing that insight or in the dishes they are so that any of that too much sense to a restaurant in in Switzerland when he got his tuition star restaurant\nA white table cross\nWas not popular on the table was no glasses when I play like nothing was just a plastic car people wait say well he tells me here seven o'clock hour here on everyone's here in the restaurant and I can say well we'll tables are full\nOur here on everyone's here in the restaurant and I can see what will tables the full nothing will happen\nUntil somebody picks up seriously that plastic how I Wonder if they get up you know there\nIs a little one euro tower and it makes it moving sound and sort of some of those types of it that will be laughing I didn't even guaranteed within a minute you'll have a whole restaurant full of moving fire was laughing Dina's and that\nIs the moment when it first comes out because then he had successfully nothing more than one euro table in the mood and he knows that will improve even the type of uh two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise]\n[noise] wow so it's like from from a neurological perspective do we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case [noise]\nUh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all kind of classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with ... which is if you have here in London and he's been I'm sending a question as several weeks have to ... his restaurant\nI'd say what'd you remember yeah and he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something they remember the experience they felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they reaching\nOur most chefs that you talk to are they on board with with your ideas did did they think yeah it is it is about the experience he's right or they or did they say that this is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nAh still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in color rich school days just the sourcing the preparation but nothing else but he says their case from your restaurants um do you serve the food we near plastic cutlery known as a silver and where's your restaurant exactly\nDo you serve the food in their plastic cutlery known as a silver isn't it and what is your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking at that nature so the the St Louis things in the one hand but clearly you can never sort of ... through just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment\nThere's going to contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] so I certainly I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now putting up starting their own venues\nWho who I really think for the first time in history saying we don't need to just now about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were sitting\nCharles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book is called the perfect meal\nYou can see his entire talked at Ted that NPR got dark\nSo let's get she still a little bit more creative about what's on our plates because that's what ... does okay my name is Marshall bicker and you are in a while I get in again where it's like an Indian\nRye for him it's very difficult for you to promote you can't do that you were out in the center of the Netherlands\nAnd in the center of the Netherlands about once a week or so and his wife have what some might consider an unusual ingredient with dinner\nAnd it's something that's stuck reports for
