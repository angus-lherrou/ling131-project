you I guess you you started out as a as a public defender right I did um I became a public defender immediately upon graduating from law school and what was what\nWas your idea behind that you thought okay I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants in criminal cases [noise] that's right\nAnd I like lots of people had no idea what was going on number little system and my daughter in law school [noise] um I joined a criminal defense clinic at NYU and step into Manhattan criminal court\nAnd never with that but luckily again this is Robyn Steinberg [noise] what I saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this passage project\nUm and I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true well\nWould you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is how we defined crime policing occurs in this\nWe defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts is deeply deeply defined by class in by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nBut definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients that their families and their entire communities here's more from Robin Steinberg on the stage\nFright um nonsense of fundamental to the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution\nAnd yet in America I'm\nIs addicted to imprison us from slavery to the massive ... it always has\nWe all know the shocking numbers the United states and crush rates more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet\nBut what you may not know is that on any given night in America almost half a million people go to sleep and those concrete jail cell who have not been convicted of anything these\nMothers and fathers and sons and daughters are there for one reason and one reason only they cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom and that\nIs calm down\nHow much does it generally cost to post bail so when somebody is arrested um judges can set bail and an amount um in their own discretion I have seen it as low as a hundred dollars for the people that we representing the clients that we see ...\nPeople that we represent and the clients that we see bail is typically under five thousand dollars but that is way beyond the reach of most families their families are making decisions about buying a gallon of milk for their children or putting that money towards bail\nIt's inconceivable to lots of Americans that you can't just go to an ATM machine and pull at five hundred dollars but that's the reality for most people coming through the criminal legal system\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from Amazon

changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes here Steven was\nWhat have you worked at the pencil it's a thing it's a legal thing\nIt's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing [noise] it's so rare books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing the great age that you'll stay behind me they too are legal things\nNow I can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese Gray Davis you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James mouse and he wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes they're legal things\nSo so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times uh thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nAnd the person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way I mean like\nYou mean like ... men\nOr actually Freeman or persons but slaves were\nNot sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now are all human beings are considered to be the person [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons because it's more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so it can you explain\nHow that works so a person and thing are both terms of art and and that's\nSo a person and things are both in terms of art and and that's up to the legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example in the last\nFew years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia as a person who has real legal writing\nIn Stephen why these recent changes as positive steps toward broadening the definition of legal person to include animals ... he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation Peter Singer\nNow I read Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I had become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless descended defenseless and I'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless the billions of\nHuman animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realize that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little\nKnown about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time\nIllegal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time\n[noise] so your objective at that time was to essentially changed the designation of nonhuman animal some illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia about Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and\nHe got there James decided he was going to escape\nOne of the first things he did was to get himself baptized because he wanted to get a set of God parents because when they ... century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with\nFall Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law the heaviest corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and get a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty\nWell lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible\nFor a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that\nHe would assume without deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should the writ of habeas corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain the ship there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support in the order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate ... the free man\nWho walked out on the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as long as concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case\n[noise] so inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers at of course a non human version of James hammers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find a gym summertime we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far or chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition\nOf chimpanzees that we can gather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear\nThat they are autonomous being that they are conscious that\nThe are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on\nWe filed a hundred and sixty pages of half a day that and we say\nAltogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively\nComplex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being\nTo being slave D is something that grinds against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise] so\nSo how did you identify the chimpanzees you want to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction the law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York\nI Would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York once we understood that we decided to simultaneously file suits on behalf of all five chimpanzees who we could identify who are being held captive in the state of New York and where were they being held captive\nWell Hercules and Leo were being held captive at Stony Brook university at the age of two professors had taken them from their mothers and\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from like fuck lifelike with Norton works to help protect identities and the information on devices from cyber criminals learned more life lock dot

the show today ideas about hacking the law and we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I Would make a voluntary once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nThose who was to interest in that you do a second random selection of those interests with making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the country so I'm making sure you had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest you would eliminate the\nHe's the structure of the lowest you would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better from my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it than that already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection buddy ... wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John had as some people\nI'm not tonight I'm Sorry I'm like it's got to the galaxy guy at Douglas Adams is that it was it's just I just got my dog of atoms saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people to all three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years of that kind of income I Would of\nProbably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change is one elected and one randomly selected in fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that was\nA regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a helmet in the world to instigate a one day like the chamber in one solution chamber once will titian buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people look at the ... and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busily back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political power place and go well why do we need that for his chamber a but this is a path to this idea\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute this in out parliament's tried to say to your friends I think we should populated out parliament with randomly selected people\nRely judging what if my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling thoughts\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these Monday examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least it's obviously yes\nI mean when you're less likely is it is something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nWe have out strategy or and that is yet to to first\nWe have our strategy or and that is yet to to first get these ...\nAssemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so\nI can see that the wood is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people who take notice maybe spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example\nA U.S state legislature with a second buddies selected bustle titian that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge surely a meal battle to try to convince people and then in French powers to um to try this\nYes uh yeah it does it I'm not I think it will be easy to political changes every easy ... ah especially fundamental political changed such as this but\nUh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to own innovate on to try something new I think half system's broken and unknown a sea

we want to build together\nWhat do we all want to know that we want to go together and then law is the thing that takes the conclusion the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual
