the solo as well\nTo be honest I think I'd rather be sitting out in the audience [laughter] it's difficult because um when you're in the audience you know you have parental janitors and nerves um but when you're on stage and you're actually functioning and trying to play or violent you're trying to concentrate on what drew is doing but at the same time not dropping my bell jar yeah exactly\nDrew growing up with such amazing musical parents I'm guessing there must have been a tiny bit of pressure to achieve\nYeah that's a question that a lot of people ask me I'm actually it wasn't as bad as you you would think they obviously [laughter]\nWhen I was really little they obviously like hammered and practice practice practice and I was like you know right [laughter] and it was it was hard at first and slowly slowly year after year I came to do it myself and have the drive myself\n[noise]\n\n\nNice in\nWashington they learn to read it in the journal\n\nNation would have been leading and

I'm a minor\n[noise] so she's she's she's got her full time job just keeping up with you and he's got really quite a quite a career going I don't know what is your brother do I know he played for a while but now he's in the other competitive endeavor\nHe's very smart guy amazing with academics and everything and as a hobby he speed skates and he's quite good at it [noise]\nExcellent so your brother's a speed skater but you yourself I I hear what you told me you're not very athletic tell everybody the story about what happened on the first day of pie in seventh grade\nSo I Walk into the gym or starting off by doing some warm up exercises specifically this one was a tiny running exercise\nAnd I somehow manage to smash may need against my thumb and I sprained my thumb didn't you have do we have a competition coming up and keep in mind this was one week before a huge competition that I was taking part in ... he can I just as he could have imagined I'm I was terrified\nAnd at\nHome I made them and I practiced away from the piano by looking at the music and studying and it's kind of like looking at a textbook memorizing the information and I think it was a great learning experience because I was able to develop a new way of practicing and the competition\nUp a new way of practicing and the competition turned out great so\nMalls or will ... will I mean gosh take care

can see how much of a tremendous musician you are and how much passion you really have keep going crazy stuff\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nThere's some\nVenture\nAnd this is one of\nIt was such a pleasure such a great honor to play that what you eat place so beautifully thank you so much as we said that you spend your school year at the interlocking arts academy where have you called whom the rest of your life\nHave you called home the rest of your life\nWell when my parents were younger they both lived internationally all over the world and so they wanted the same thing for my sister and I so in addition to living in Montana in Washington we also spent time in France and most recently we've been living in India\nWow so you've learned to accommodate all sorts of costumes and cultures in your life in India you also had to accommodate the monkeys [laughter] hurry [laughter]\nOh my goodness I Am terrified of monkeys they're all over the hillside um where are you still live and uh gosh they've been in my kitchen in classrooms um you know there's even bars on the practice room we chose to keep them out\nBut I think the most memorable experience I've had to think he's was on the way to rehearsal one day\nI I ran into a troop of about thirty recess monkeys and I was running a little late so I I couldn't go around them and I decided to go through them and said\nAnd uh that was that was a mistake there's like three cardinal rules or when you encounter monkeys one is don't make eye contact the other is don't share your teeth and the third is don't get between them and their food\nAnd I broke the third one because they they were\nThey were uh they knocked over some supposedly a monkey prove garbage bans and so I was like picking my way through all of this food debris you know trying to avoid them I went around this motorcycle trying to put like a barrier between me and the monkeys and instead it was used as a launching point for one of them to jump off of an onto my back [laughter]\nAnd so I ended up running [laughter]\nAnd so I ended up running running to the school you know it's one case and monkey bouncing behind me screaming my ... my ...\nShould have taken your horn out because as you know music suits to Savage beast\nOh they tend to avoid my horn I don't know you up to you to decide whether they have good taste or bad [laughter]\nAlways a critic I guess well the monkeys would have loved his performance on positive as we all did great on a plane with your lives with best of luck St Elizabeth posted into an Eighteen year old French horn player from Washington and\nHalf\nHalf the from the top featuring bonus content not heard on the radio broadcast are available every weekend from the top that or the appearance of Ethan trying in the ... next on the program is supported by the ... foundation or being Caesar fun\nPrint today we're featuring teenage soloist playing with the buffalo filler Monica in front of an audience of middle school and high school students and it's time to hear the whole orchestra again\nAnd to welcome back they're wonderful music director joann the letter Joanne you've been a champion of new music and new composers and we're going to continue that tradition now or would you introduce the teenage composer whose music we're going to hear next\nYes we're delighted to welcome to buffalo Ethan try him in for the buffalo premier his piece welcome\nEthan or we're going to hear a short piece of yours called Saturn's rings tell everybody about the workers ration you came up with in order to evoke that image\nLarge part of my thinking in this piece was trying to trace sound physically throughout\nPeace was trying to trace sound physically throughout the orchestra as pitches are passed around in a way that sort of mimics the orbiting Saturn's rings around the planet\nThe other thing I was thinking was trying to make each part really comfortable for the player who's playing it and in the program back in Los Angeles that I'm In the Los Angeles philharmonic composers fellowship program\nProfessional musicians from the Los Angeles philharmonic come and speak to us about their instruments and they tell us all sorts of things that\nThey like to play that they don't like to play that we should stay away from as composers things that make their life needlessly difficult or things that a function really naturally on their instruments so that's something I tried to think about\nGreat knowledge to catch up on Joanne anything to add about ... piece\nJust that we're delighted to add another new piece to our repertoire Ethan and we hope to see more of you in play other pieces as well\nThis is a beautifully concentrated miniature this peace let's give this a spin so to speak this is Saturn's rings by Ethan trimester\n\n\n\nOoh [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nPlease you're thinking [noise]\n\nRumble Ethan I I understand it's one of your first or casual pieces and it just sounds so masterful the way you command in various different colors of the orchestra and I could hear that\nIntense sort of standing around\nIntense sort of sending around in in terms of Saturn's rings the sound of the notes from one section of the orchestra studio they're really quite a brilliant concept of in the great tradition of composers just starting out\nI Know you started playing piano initially your first couple of pieces were in the style of famous composer so who're you emulating\nWhen I first started writing my own compositions I was playing a lot of uh WC and Gershwin 'em and sort of by happenstance but actually just because I was accidentally plagiarize and my competitions would incorporate um elements of their work um until\nWeeks after writing it I listen to a piece that I wrote and go oh that's directly from you know this piece or that these and sort of\nBy conglomeration of all there's different styles I started emerging with my own\nYeah well it it's ... ... of course you know the the way we learn I mean I I guess without stealing the notes for instance you can hear record in the orchestra and like the way that its position with the flu to soon and clarinet and say oh I'll use that exactly", "show_name": "From the Top", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "15"}
