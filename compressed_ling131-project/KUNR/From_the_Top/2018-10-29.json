French horn but you know eventually she came around and\nYou know she's been really supportive of me my entire family has been really supportive of me and you know they've suffered through many I'm late nights of very loud practicing so I'm really grateful for that and\nI'm very priests and your and your mom was you know right you know because the the the quintessential sound of a joke\nWhy why is a trombone yeah I mean he had it right from the first got but I'm Glad she's glad she's into it I Love the trombone Carl I don't know how your parents feel about you're taking on the trombone but they sure love vinyl records yes they\nA my actually my parents met um my dad was huge and ... into collecting vinyl my mom was too but uh there were at a social gathering at college and um my my dad looks over and there's this there's this girl looking through his eye\nMy my dad looks over and there's this there's this girl looking through his final and first he freaked out because he was collecting that in his favorite thing and then it was like what it's like I'm going to go and talk to her um and so now our our entire living room is sort of turned into this big library of vinyl records that my dad is sort of turned into as he calls it the listening room\nUm and yeah so it's it's quite literally been the the center of our household you guys reverse in the listening rooms sometimes\nI guess redo my sometimes get in the way that all that final trying to get everything has quite a challenge [laughter] Jonah you have a very deep and profound reason for choosing jumped on um yeah I really liked to fly the thing that's really the best\nReally is makes the most expressive no bras instrument I I think that's unquestioned roughly ... your family saved a bone rangers concert from disaster they showed\nIt well back then it was my first week of being in the ... I was the newest member and so we had a gig\nI grandpa votes at Chicago Illinois and I was going to fight it that I got that we're going to get to perform these guys here\nAnd then all of a sudden it started pouring rain though it was just\nThe one it was horrible and we were we were afraid that no one was going to show up because they moved on to a tiny ten so we won't we won't get wet and those I barely like four or five people into and we thought and the one was going to show up and it's all like I have to pay back to the songs like supposedly we were going to call the other day\nBut also thought in my family\nBut all of a sudden my family or friends show up to the performance and it's just like\nWithin a split second it turned into just a sweet little elderly couple in our coach Tim Reardon sitting in the back um to them this huge caravan of ... showing up and that sort of English show and ... there was just like this monsoon is rather going on and so it made it a little bit more bearable diving audience\nYeah Shonda Noriega areas right there were there to to to take care of you guys and of course with the monsoon like rain the only thing that can cut through that kind of

[noise]\nWelcome\nMaxine what are these two contrasting worse so I'll be playing the six minute about the second part\nSo I'll be playing the six minute above second partied ... bringing about the Eighteen century and then I'll be playing ... six contrary to toss her all written in Nineteen eighty four stages yours\nMm\nMm [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nWhich is the second bird feeders monitored by your boss and the sick of contradict used by Nikolai\nPublished dean performed worse by Maxine park Thirteen Years old or piano from Hanover New Hampshire mixing you tackle that music was such great confidence but when you were younger you say that you were afraid of the spotlight\nYeah so my first aside all I was playing Yankee Doodle with my mom and it was a ... and I was playing the melody park on the top register of the piano and I'm On the plane they come from it on the bottom register\nUm but I thought the audience is too close so I wanted my mom to play the bottom part of the top part says that she could hide me from the audience that I could just play in the back [noise]\nUm yeah that didn't work out too well but [laughter]\nBut uh your mom is also somebody who's contributed some a great thing I Wish somebody said this to me a long ago\nA social psychologist and she taught you something that helps you quite a bit as a young pianist when you were more nervous\nYeah so my mom used to tell me a lot when I was little don't compare yourself to other people because you'll never be happy with how you do you're just trying to do better than somebody else all the time um so I Can't remember this is the word no social comparison\nUm and that's really helped me a lot with piano especially because when I go up to play or even to practice I'm thinking about what do I want to do to improve my past self not trying to improve basis\nProve my past self not trying to improve based on somebody else or something like that [noise] um and also when I perform I can just go up there and have fun because I'm not really worried about doing better than something or having a stern outcome so I can just have fun\nSo strong was and we should learn from them that's beautiful or your parents are both avid amateur pianist and there was a joke about what you have to do to be a member of your family\nYeah so my parents met in college and my dad is playing the ship had any minor concerto um and my mom was also playing that concerto at the time so she came over to talk to them and at first he thought that he was impressing her just like plaintiff he's turned out she was much better than us and he was um [laughter] but um\n[noise] so there's a joke in my family that you have to play one of the two Chopin concerto is either the F ... fighter because they both play both of those can chair does um and so I'm not a member of the family yet but I'm working on it which one are you working on I'm working on that flight and my favorite\nToo [noise] so your parents are very strong musicians but neither of them chose to pursue music as a career I also know you love math and science so where do you think you'll end up\nWell I guess I don't really know right now one of the things that my parents have kind of taught me is that you don't have to play piano professionally in order to still love it and enjoy it\nI'm so definitely still want to keep playing piano and enjoying it when I get older um but I think it really depends a lot on like the people you meet because I've met a lot of mentors who've changed my perspective and the things that I wanted to do so I don't know maybe I Will become a professional pianist or maybe not really for it\nThat's for sure Maxine it was such a pleasure hearing you and I hope we get to you again sometime give thanks vaccine\nYou're you again sometime yeah thanks Maxine\nBack and forth or even a half or [noise]\nBack on stage with me
