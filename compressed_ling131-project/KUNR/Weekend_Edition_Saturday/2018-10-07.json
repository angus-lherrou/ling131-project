Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up he'll suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court [noise]\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do with the Constitution's says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial of being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we left that\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that\nEyes are on the Supreme Court well\nI guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether\nThe employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex\nCovers gay and lesbian employees just as Kevin out of places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the courts swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement and June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new worlds look like\nI'm closely contested cases you will see a\nCourt that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment for the ability of the federal government to regulate\nFor the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power or not\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thank you need us so much

know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate treat you as was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you're of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody\nElse how's that different what what are the challenges that you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me to say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and they're\nLike there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents experience as white

of sexual assault supporters uh with Roy Moore in Alabama President Trump on tape saying he has sexually assaulted women and now ... Supreme Court justice where does this leave\nThe country well like a week ago when a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI investigate what he said was this is ripping our country apart\nAnd that is really how it has felt at ... the whole episode has been sort of an ice pick into our nations rise wounds if that's not to grow to be an analogy\nI thought you know I think people were already angry but the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled a lot of these questions are and how emotional they are for so many people as you said on on on both sides uh uh\nUh left that was already I quite exercised particularly ... particularly women uh\nAnd uh on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the president\nYet the midterm elections are less than a month away and President Trump has this a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is closing is the wind up the president's back now and the Republicans\nDo I think I have no idea\nThe president's back now and the Republicans do I think I have no idea frankly [laughter]\nIt's close to an election it's it's hard to tell what is signal and what his noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national sentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republicans seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them uh but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nI ... and the trajectory is still rather remarkably as you said a those statistics are very good for the party in power usually a president with this kind of economic strength\nIs pulling quite high and yet the president is quite unpopular and that has rubbed off on the Republican Party and we have seen Republicans are really struggling to

Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nWe're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina Hi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non\nAnd the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up bill suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court [noise]\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do with the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have\nTo figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial and neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we left that\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for example future this term maybe\nFiled for the short term for example future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based\nOn sex covers gay and lesbian employees just as Kevin on a places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the courts swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement in June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new worlds look like\nI'm closely contested cases you will see a\nCourt that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment for the ability of the federal government to regulate\nFor the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power or not\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thinking you know so very much thank you my\nName's Nicole Chung was born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted by a white couple when she\nWas an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence how it was attributed to God or to state you know as if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it's\nAnd um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because the story was all I\nKnew and it was so important to all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions in a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family\nDidn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate treat you as was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody\nElse how's that different what what are the challenges that you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents first of all\nWouldn't have occurred to me to say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents' experience as white Americans I really remember feeling as though\nAs white Americans I really remember feeling as though I Can't tell them like it will hurt them I have to protect them from this knowledge and if I tell them they might not understand anyway because they're white\n\n\nOn trial Snyder with these headlines\nPresident Trump is calling Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court a tremendous victory and at last

Arabian journalist at the Saudi conflict in Istanbul\nTurkey and Saudi Arabia are at odds on the world stage and the accusation by Turkish investigators that Washington Post contributor ... was killed inside the Saudi conflict has ratcheted up regional tensions\nThe Saudis have strongly denied the allegations NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us from is simple now to sort through the story I'm good morning I live\nIt's a very confusing tale um talk us through what do we know\nWell we know Jamal ... walked into the Saturday constantly Tuesday around one in the afternoon he needed some paperwork relating

consulate closed a says he never came out\nA Turkish police opened an investigation and then came the surprising reports at first by unnamed Turkish officials now on the record by an advisor to president ... on that investigators believe the show he was killed in the consulate are aired on says he's saddened that the journalist disappearance but not much more than that so far\nWe haven't seen any evidence to back up his claim that the show is dead just the persistent question if he's still alive where Izzie\n... what is the Saudis and saying well\nThe Saudis are basically denying everything except the fact that they show you did come into the constantly Tuesday Afternoon\nOr the Saudi press agency quotes officials saying he left the consulate Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg News they're very keen to know what happened to him a there is no evidence on the outside of whoever to show that show he actually did leave the consulate\nUh the consul general invited Reuters reporters in showed them around there was no sign of ... he said that constantly has multiple exits but why would show the lead by another exit if he knew his fiance was waiting out front\nSo lots of questions this advisor to president air to one says he's convinced to plane loads of Saudis who arrived in this stumbled on Tuesday the same day could show you went into the consulate were somehow involved he also says he doesn't believe the Saudi claims that there is no camera footage of the show ... either inside or leaving the council\nAlright two questions in the first one is um why is this important what does this mean for Saudi relations with turkey and with other world powers\nWell it could be very important but a lot will depend on what we learn from here on about ... disappearance what happened to him that seems likely to be further blow to Saudi turkey ties are relations were already strained Turkey's been siding with another Persian Gulf states Qatar and a bitter dispute with the Saudis\nStrange Turkey's been siding with another Persian Gulf state cutter and a bitter dispute with the Saudis\nAre some are wondering what the American response

Administration it it's not happening in public\nAnd why would show the Leslie had been on someone's list them and why is he someone that is of interest\nWell that is a very good question to show his

questions and a reporter asked him what message she had for the women out there who were devastated feeling devastated by this result and President Trump said that he didn't think there were any women like that women\nI think that's sort of [noise]\nFeel we're anywhere is wrong\nA lot of women that are shrewd way from Memphis that's\nAn echo of something that he said at a rally last\nWeek a in Mississippi a rally where he turned on Christine Blasey Ford and and really went after her and attacked her for her lapses in memory and Trump said on the plane yesterday that he believed that turn that rally really helped push Brett Kavanaugh over the finish line\nAnd that's something that's being echoed in talking points across the Republican spectrum tickets to the rally of this isn't your first Trump rally and we've heard so much about how important the Supreme Court is to rank and file Republicans was that have had in the crowd with these values notably happier and more satisfied than Trump's crowds pre Kevin\nWell they definitely seemed to be in a good mood but here's something that I found really fascinating when President Trump talked about Kavanaugh they cheered when President

these are the people that he has already persuaded why go to Kansas\nThe president is going to a bunch of states where he won in a big way oh one reason for that is he loves doing rallies where there

S. where NPR's Jackie Northam reports Washington is pushing back\nThe U.S is unquestionably the leader in advanced technology think artificial intelligence robotics sophisticated weaponry it's what's helped give the country a national security edge\nThat something China has recognized and one's in on says James Lewis a specialist in China and technology at the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThe Chinese figured out the technology is key to ... an hour and the source of technology is still the west for China so how do they get their hands on that western technology\nThree years ago Beijing unveiled it's made in China twenty twenty five strategy which calls for the country to become a world leader in advanced technologies including artificial intelligence AI\nAs part of that China is forming global partnerships pumping massive resources into tech firms at home in Europe and here in the U.S\nSay they're very systematic very long term in their approach and it's very well funded\nMichael Brown is with the Pentagon's defense innovation unit in Silicon valley he says there's serious concern in Washington that China is acquiring\nSince they're serious concern in Washington that China is acquiring too much sensitive us technology and transferring it back home\nThey don't play by the same rules that we do so a cyber theft is on the table industrial espionage was on the table which can include recruiting key talent a networking events that are sponsored by the Chinese government working with us universities\nJust last week Bloomberg reported to us was investigating whether China allegedly infiltrated the Pentagon and major companies such as apple and Amazon by building spy chips into server mother boards and mother boards were manufactured in China that companies denied the allegations\nBut there are other ways China is making inroads to capture American innovation [noise]\nThere's a quiet leafy part is Silicon Valley called Sunnyvale and a lot of the tech giants have a presence here there's Amazon labs linked in Yahoo and coming up now to a Google complex and I can actually see some of the workers city a picnic tables and enjoying the fine weather\nJust behind the Google complex is a Chinese company called ... and it's ... arrival\nBy do is China's largest Internet search provider it open this innovation center here in Silicon valley with a focus on self driving vehicles and other Chinese tech powerhouses Alibaba ten cent\nAway also have their own research and development centers here instead of buying an existing us business the Chinese tech giants come in and build a new company from the ground up these moves are called\nAnd build a new company from the ground up these moves are called Greenfield investments and they hire away a lot of us workers says the C.

Lewis\nPeople change jobs frequently in the tech industry and you say I'll pay you a little bit more than the market rate you'll get a lot of talent this is a way to acquire no\nThere's also been a surge of investments in tech startups to Chinese venture capital Adam ... a senior analyst at rodeo group an economic research firm says there were more than ... Thirteen hundred rounds of funding for us start ups with at least one Chinese investor over the past eight years\nIs very common for Chinese firms to have some sort of ties to the government it might just be because they have to answer to the government of party leaders back at home and the first the state some level of control\nLike shingles says this has become a concern and national security circles because the nature of emerging technology is inherently you'll use in other words the AI algorithms used to help speed up your smart phones could also be applied to weapons on the

that\nVenture capital and other minority investments provide Chinese investors access potentially sensitive technologies particularly ones that are in a sense an early stage where us governments haven't had a full chance to evaluate the implications of those technologies\nBut for many American tech startups Chinese investment can be critical\nI think we got lucky and got a beautiful shreds it

until you can realize your ideas into\nSky mind now has funding from some major American venture capitalists and a few smaller Chinese ones Nicholson disputes that venture capital investors automatically gain access to start ups research or know how\nLater stage investors putting in much larger amounts typically ask for things like information writes import seats Nicholson says no investor has ever ask I mind for confidential technical information\nRight now we have to see what it's me and my co founder of Americans\nDecades funding for firms like Nicholson's was through the defense department it helped create technological breakthroughs that led to things like semi conductors in miniaturized GPS\nBut that funding over the years has become slow and cumbersome well

with us but have a great capability that we would all benefit from\nThis alternate funding is one way Washington is trying to counter Chinese investment\nThe Trump Administration has also been aggressive in blocking several large mergers and acquisitions of us tech companies by Chinese firms\nAnd Congress is beefing up laws on the books aimed at protecting us technology from foreign governments it will allow closer scrutiny of all sorts of Chinese inroads in the tech sector says Mario ... a trained lawyer was Kirkland analysis\nI think some deals where there are Chinese investors

were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish and this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the president\nYet the midterm elections are less than a month's away and President Trump has this a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is closing is the wind up the president's back now and the Republicans do\nI think I have no idea frankly [laughter] this

think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for

being fair and impartial and neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment\nThan we left that um this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for example future this term maybe even next term sometimes you can of ah avoid

you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nThink it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate to choose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you are you're of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought and trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nDidn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else how's that different what what are the challenges you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically
