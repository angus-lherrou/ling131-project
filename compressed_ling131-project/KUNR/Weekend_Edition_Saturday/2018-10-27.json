from traveling since his father had left the kingdom to go into exile\nOh there's no question the royal family had banned him from traveling since his father had left the kingdom to go into exile and

efforts by the Russian backed Internet research agency to use Twitter budge to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew beaten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem to beaten joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nWhy was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane of the anthems well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues\nSixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just people that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this\nWas an issue that reached the top of\nThe food chain what did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets had gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players\nIt's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\nMm So it it it wasn't direct the TV in a certain result just to to stir things up apparently yeah\nAnd the result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught contentious issue\nAnd also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right yeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with these it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the interesting notes that the clubs and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations and they're continuing to weigh in\nOn controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on\nYears is not a lot of time if you're say Betty White you know what's good for twentieth anniversary is drier Lynch and we have a whole lot of it on our way to

have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job in the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues\nAs your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions they're inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill Curtis yeah how could you not and I miss Carl Kasell\nWe all you've had

in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ed these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\nWell it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that\nWell it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit the policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those\nTogether you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah have you\nNoticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting a job on\nYes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter singer of the season on through\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have ...\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in\nWays that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being connected to terrorist organizations and that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been sent out to a number of people and and questions are being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boat in college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being

[noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen to Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was an absolutely riveting and in stunning\nEighteen pictures used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best picture on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter he didn't even throw the ball or does is anybody left to throw the game tonight\nWell the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex Cora still haven't decided who he's starting later today in game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all these Scott six innings in relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches he was brilliant and of course max\nShy of a hundred pitches he was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker bealer regattas a healer dealer [laughter] my God he was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and asked to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no teams ever come back in the world series from a three oh deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal\nWhen with Walker bealer being the start of the night does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win ... that's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into game for but both teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the one thing we can say we've got a series now\nAnd uh it's fun Tom Goldman thanks

Scott Simon\nLast week federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described efforts by the Russian backed Internet research agency to use Twitter budge to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including issues raised in sports\nAndrew beaten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players shouldn't deal during the plane of the national anthem just beaten joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took a near not during the plane or the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets had gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan\nOr is which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that break down wonder how that influenced the conversation\n... so it it it wasn't director achieving a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nAnd the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught\nContentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate [noise]\nUh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right yeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with these it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations and they're continuing to weigh in\nOn controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charge moment and then that's the type of things\nColin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in Andrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being

Scott Simon negative campaign ads have become just about as much a part of the season is pumpkin spice in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ed these days it's not negative am I just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen but one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is\nSo as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content on line\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter singer of the season aren't you\n[laughter] uh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being\nConnected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been sent out to a number of people and and questions being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nYeah this is a tough one to decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between boats\nI think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boat in college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and brown weekend edition Sunday Lulu

what a game unbelievable I I watched all of it well kind of all of that I I watched um [noise] you know there were some times maybe ... fourteen through Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but in general it was absolutely riveting and and stunning\nEighteenth pictures used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best picture on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter he didn't even throw the ball a does is anybody left to throw the game tonight\n[laughter] well the Dodgers have named the starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex ... still hadn't decided who he's starting later today and game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker bealer we got to say dealer dealers [laughter] if I got he was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe

neighborhood um we are kind of thing at an intersection at pretty rainy and cold and\nNeighborhood uh Pittsburgh which is a traditionally Jewish neighborhood um we are kind of standing at an intersection it's pretty rainy and cold and there are a lot of police cars a lot of ambulances\nUm and there are members of the community some are crying summer not really sure what's happening and then you know you see people who haven't heard anything about this so far who are on a morning Walker morning run and then they see these police cars and they're not not quite sure what's happening\n[noise] do do we know anything about the density of the victims at this point\n[noise] um we have not been briefed police have yet to do a another update with us at ... the last I heard which was about an hour ago um they had a suspect in custody they were not commenting on victims but there were ...\n... and there's still a morning for residents with the neighborhood to shelter in place which would suggest that they they're not your altogether shirt and that it's just this one person they open toasted it wasn't true\nYeah that's what I Would assume too I mean we don't have any information about that but the the police are asking members of the community to\nStay inside um this happened at a synagogue is just a couple of blocks away from where we are now um I've been told that you know usually on a on a Saturday morning like this or fifty or sixty people who might come to a worship\nThere and um so it's it's it's right in our neighborhood rate here so we're not quite sure what's going to happen\nThis is a famous neighborhood in Pittsburgh has been for some time isn't it\nYeah it is this world here in this world will neighborhood um is is traditionally a of a Jewish neighborhood neighborhood here and\nI was told by I'm a member of the community who's the head of the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh that over fifty percent of Jewish residents live here I live in this concentrated neighborhood it's a beautiful neighborhood big\nBrick houses I'm a Jewish community center is a couple blocks away and so this is a really important part of the Jewish community and that's part of Pennsylvania\nAnd we will we will turn our listeners\nPart of the Jewish community and that's part of ...\nAnd we will we will tell our listeners we are aware of the fact that there are a multiple numbers that are being reported on various social media platforms and in fact uh\nUh some social media platforms who purport to know the identity of the person who is in custody we do not report that until we can certify that as a fact uh and and so it was Lucy I'm sure you're aware of that but officials\nHave not for him that identity of you have they\nCrack at the gym\nOr um the I Know you and other members of the media going to be on the scene it must be hard to get to gain access but I gather that police and and perhaps the mayor will be having a press conference right\nYes there are represented from the police department here governor well uh it's actually also here and I'm told that I'm the mayor if you're obviously but I'm told that either a politician and lawmakers from the area are making their way here to offer as much help and support as possible\nLucy Perkins of one of our member stations W E essay in Pittsburgh thanks so much for

of sober thoughtful news exactly we knew that the people\nHere's of sober thoughtful news ... exactly we knew that people just didn't take NPR seriously enough with all your frivolously\nAnd high jinx so we decided that we needed to finally try to acquire a reputation for sober consideration at this network and I'm Glad to have done it thanks so much I'm Serious question yes um\nThey're serious chilling events a school shooting range church bombings in this week along thankfully no one's harm bomb threats\nSo much harder than others to have fun with the news Oh yes but we know that we have a particular role or handling all that stuff\nThat's your job and we know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff and focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad\nThe more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really bring the silly [noise] you've had so many um famous gas including of course of a president of United States to two presidents of the yeah we had the rock Obama before he became president but I'm taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to me since [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appear to host president say that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions they're inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill Curtis yeah how could you not and I miss Carl Kasell\nWe all you've had some great partners I haven't I've been blessed and I have stood on the shoulders are next to the shoulders of giants as everyone knows are not only was Carl Kasell original judge and

sense of humor gosh yes yes and he runs a little shall we say salacious I Believe is the public radio word will use and every now and then our audience gets a glimpse of that but my favorite thing is when off air he'll let loose with the profanity\nAnd it is stunning to hear that voice using that language\nOh my gosh you can it can boil the hair right off the it was quite fun\nWe go who richer the music the music of course was written by BJ Lederman what a coincidence coincidence ours do did you ask him what the heck that noise is at the beginning of our theme almost as if\nHe's starting to the
