Navarro\nThe midterms are less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate House and many will also choose governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the geo Pete is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break 'em down he Jessica\nLulu so Ken Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors they haven't really good chance they could pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it's a good sign for Democrats math is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month of the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida's always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these were the purple states and so that's\nAnd when and these sort of purple states and so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santas it's going to be I think a really close race still\nNext door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams will be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's we're always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it sort of a mixture of things you've ever really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by five super education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican some polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising and notable for Republicans and how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection they could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank\nYou so much thank you abolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the call

politics for political and he joins us now on the line thanks for being with us\nBy driving so first off you grow up in Key West you're a native Floridian and a Key West injured or not just over a year ago you've seen a lot of storms come through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction that's caused\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of Cleveland in Mississippi\nLooked a lot like Mexico beach looks now there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs and then all of\nThe associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once lush area into a desert just stripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation construction no trees\nJust a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson and a charismatic ... out of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against Ron dissent is a former congressman\nWho also has a lot of support in pockets of a Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nFlorida you know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likeliest scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing\nTo run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally risk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over ah both physically in these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of been the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee the mayor\nBut it was pretty hard\nIt was hit yeah a ... Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as a Mexico beach right in the uh the the county Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent run the census for his leadership during a storm hurricane her mean this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seen a visibly\nIn in one case actually chain sewing trees away [laughter] and\nI'm moving debris really so he's changed on your trees well he's he's making sure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so everyone\nPerceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone's trying to capitalize on the on the media moment and and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess it remains to be seen a what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they are going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nShort we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire paying ... impossible you can't get a hold of you know in a sense of the people\nThat political as more computer joining us from Florida this morning thanks so much thank you\nTomorrow on MORNING edition after a big win on the Supreme Court Republicans and conservatives seemed to be at the height of their political power but will that change after November tuned in to MORNING EDITION to hear what's at stake for the ... and their majorities in Congress you can ask\n'em you can listen by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your member station by name and\nSears the chain of department stores has been a part of American culture for a hundred and twenty five years the commercials from my childhood set a goal\nAnd more [laughter] [noise]\n\nI won't be able to get that out of my head now but the auto center hardware appliance and clothing store is approaching\nThe end of its long slow decline Sears Holdings the company that owns years and I should say Kmart needs to pay back a hundred and thirty four million dollars of debt by tomorrow or faced bankruptcy Jerry Hancock is a Sears fan and historian and he joins us now thanks for being on the program\nThe problem thanks for having me how are you feeling about this moment as I said\nNo problem thanks for having me how are you feeling about this moment as I said Sears has been struggling for a while but tomorrow's deadline looks serious and reports are that it's big lenders are pushing for liquidation\nYeah it's um it's sort of sad really uh it's Sears is an American institution you know I was listening to the commercial you were just playing and it brought back memories for me as well I mean I think that's really a big part of the the staying power is it it's sort of nostalgic you know for older generations\nStay tuned wait well don't wait wait don't tell me\nOn trial Snyder with these headlines\nSaudi Arabia is threatening to retaliate after President Trump warned if a severe punishment of Saudi Arabia is bound to have been involved in the disappearance of journalist ... the government issued a statement today after the Saudis stock market plunged Trump born of consequences that an interview with CBS is sixty minutes\nBut he among the crowd packed into St Peter's Square today we're from El Salvador they traveled around and watched Pope Francis canonize of seen archbishop Oscar Romero Romero was proclaimed to St alongside pope Paul the six and several others\nAnd Somalia is marking the first anniversary of the deadliest terrorist attack in the country's history a bombing in the center of Mogadishu that killed nearly six hundred people a year ago\nOn trial Snyder NPR News from Culver City\nCalifornia [noise]\nSupport for NPR\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from indeed used by over three million businesses for hiring where employers can post jobs and use screener questions to build their shortlist of preferred candidates learned more it indeed dot com slash higher\nFrom American Jewish World Service working together for more than Thirty years to build them or just in Des quotable world learn more at age eight W.

I've ever felt all my children survived all my grandchildren survive will say well rebuild will be good\nRobin and ... of Springfield and Sally half Callaway, Florida to communities that were particularly hard hit when the eye of hurricane Michael pass through joining with the latest on the relief effort is NPR's Joel Rose in Myanmar Beach Florida the morning Hi Lulu\nOr you've been in Panama City and the surrounding towns I mean tell me what you're seeing\nWell ... it feels like the relief effort really is getting underway now at least in and around Panama City it took a few long days after the storm for the official response to sort of get off the ground\nBut I really saw a difference on Saturday there were multiple locations in Panama City and other towns where emergency officials are handing out food and water like we just heard of the top\nBut that said there is a huge need for basic supplies and not just on the coast storm did a lot of damage in small dirt road towns forty and fifty miles inland and there are very long lines for supplies all over the region lots of people need help\nYeah and the pictures of devastation or are incredible and much of this is still without electricity right any any sense when it's coming back\nThere are still tens of thousands of people without power the local utility Gulf Power estimates it's going to restore electricity to most of the region by the end of the week but that estimate does not include some of the hardest hit areas right around Panama City which might be without power for weeks\nIs right around Panama City which might be without power for weeks I Would say maybe months just driving around in Panama City I mean that's unbelievable the number of electrical poles that are down you see power lines in the street everywhere you can't really drive without driving over them\nAnd at the same time there's no water nominee gas stations are open the ones that do have gas have really long lines so I think things are gonna be pretty rough year for the foreseeable future\nJoel what are people telling you they're going to do it they're going to stick it out are they going to leave\nI think a lot of people may not have any choice I mean both in and around Panama City and out in the countryside it's one of the poorest regions of Florida are places where people a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck\nAnd just you know right now a lot of the people I've talked to her are focused on just getting through today and tomorrow you know trying to get water an ice trying to get a tarp to cover up the hole in the roof maybe before it rains um although luckily there's no rain in the immediate forecasts but you know that's where people's minds are\nYeah we've heard they were really big problems also with communications is that getting any better\nOr not that I've seen I most cell carriers are still down in around Panama City I mean many even emergency officials don't have phones that work um so it you know it's a big problem people can call their relatives to say they're okay um and and it's I think has to be one of the things that's really slowing down the rescue and relief effort\nOn

... edge among governors they haven't\nReally good chance they could pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats\nAnd this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them\nWhat states are you watching heading into this last month the campaign I mean where they're really tight races\nSome a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida's always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santas it's going to be I think are really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams will be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's the states\nAn American woman ever elected governor and and that's a state that is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question and then they're sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt um Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but\nThen Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's a mixture of things you really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by five super education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican or

going to do respiration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the element\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they\nWhen asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills\nAbout one in ten said they'd accepted twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says is a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where

struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led to the states he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year

governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far that Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of been the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee mare\nBut it was hand pretty hard it was hit yeah a ... Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as a Mexico beach right in the\nUh the the county Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent run the census for his leadership during a storm hurricane her mean\nThis time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seen a visibly in in one case actually chain sewing trees away [laughter] and\nI'm moving debris really so he's changed on your trees [laughter] well he's\nHe's making sure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone is trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess it remains to be seen a what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nThe what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nShort we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire entitles your meals a right now she can't get a hold of you know ... percent of the people\nThat's political as more computer joining us from Florida this morning thanks so much thank you\nTomorrow on MORNING edition after big win on the Supreme Court Republicans and conservatives seemed to be at the height of their political power but will that change after November tune in to MORNING EDITION to hear what's at stake for the GOP and their majorities in Congress you can listen by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your member station by name and\nSears the chain of department stores has been a part of American culture for a hundred and twenty five years the commercials from my childhood set a goal\nRight out more [laughter] you know [laughter]\n\nI won't be able to get that out of my head now but the auto center hardware appliance and clothing store is approaching\nThe end of its long slow decline Sears Holdings the company that owns years and I should say Kmart needs to pay back a hundred and thirty four million dollars of debt by tomorrow or faced bankruptcy Jerry Hancock is a Sears fan and historian and he joins us now thanks for being on the program\nNo problem thanks for having me how are you feeling about this moment as I said Sears has been struggling for a while but tomorrow's deadline looks serious and reports are that it's big lenders are pushing for liquidation\nIt's um it's sort of said really a Sears is an American institution\nSad really uh it's Sears is an American institution you know I was listening to the commercial you were just playing and it brought back memories for me as well I mean I think that's really a big part of the the staying power or is it it's sort of nostalgic you know for older generations\nI mean I grew up in the seventies and she was still you know a gargantuan at that point a lot of people would say that that was sort of their pinnacle a the sixties and seventies the post World War two era but if you talk to some of the retirees and folks who used to work for years\nThis afternoon two o'clock at you and ours night and guilt concert hall tickets in Reno chamber orchestra daughter word [noise]\nI'm Barbara Klein with these headlines several communities in the Florida Panhandle are finally getting badly needed food water and fuel after being slammed by hurricane Michael last week tens of thousands are still without power\nIn a rare public disclosure the Afghan Taliban say they've met with the U.S special envoy for reconciliation and effort to end Afghanistan Seventeen year long war the Taliban is demanding fond forces leave the country [noise]\nGame too of baseball's American League championship series is today the Houston Astros start a head beating the Boston Red Sox last night after game two of the national league series the Los Angeles Dodgers and Milwaukee Brewers are tied one one I'm Barbara Klein NPR News\nNew to me [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from indeed used by over three million businesses for hiring\nIndeed used by over three million businesses for hiring where employers can post jobs and you screener questions to build their shortlist of preferred candidates learned more it indeed dot com slash higher\nFrom American Jewish World Service working together for more than Thirty years to build them or just and equitable world learn more at age eight W.

hard by hurricane Michael Parker elementary school just outside Panama City National Guard troops headed out water and ready to eat meals to residents\nWe cannot because we've heard out they were passing out food and they go out we can get I'm Alive\nWas evidence on again and then if I bought it at times it's the most devastated I've ever been but the most less I've ever felt all my children survived all my grandchildren survived will say well rebuild will be good\nRobin and ... of Springfield and Sally half Callaway, Florida to communities that were particularly hard hit when the eye of hurricane Michael pass through joining with the latest on the relief effort is NPR's Joel Rose in Miramar Beach Florida the morning time loop\nOr you've been in Panama City and the surrounding towns I mean tell me what you're seeing\nWell it feels like the relief effort really is getting underway now at least in and around Panama City it took a few long days after the storm for the official response to sort of get off the ground\nBut I really saw difference on Saturday there were multiple locations in Panama City and other towns where emergency officials were handing out food and water like we just heard of the top\nBut that said there is a huge need for basic supplies and not just on the coast storm did a lot of damage in small dirt road towns forty and fifty miles inland and there are very long lines for supplies all over the region lots of people need help\nAnd the pictures of devastation or are incredible and much of this is still with\nOf devastation or are incredible and much of this and it it's still without electricity right any any sense when it's coming back\nYeah there are still tens of thousands of people without power the local utility Gulf Power estimates it's going to restore electricity to most of the region by the end of the week\nBut that estimate does not include some of the hardest hit areas right around Panama City which might be without power for weeks I Would say maybe months just driving around in Panama City I mean it's unbelievable the number of electrical poles that are down you see power lines in the street everywhere you can't really drive without driving over them\nAnd at the same time there's no water nominee gas stations are open the ones that do have gas have really long lines so I think things are gonna be pretty rough year for the foreseeable future\nJoel what are people telling you they're going to deal with it and stick it out or they're going to leave\nI think a lot of people may not have any choice I mean both in and around Panama City and out in the countryside is one of the poorest regions of Florida are places where people a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck\nAnd just you know right now a lot of the people I've talked to her are focused on just getting through today and tomorrow you know trying to get water an ice trying to get a a tarp to cover up the hole in the roof maybe before it rains um although luckily there's no rain in the immediate forecasts but you know that's where people's minds are\nYeah we've heard they were really big problems also with communications is that getting any better\nOr not that I've seen most cell carriers are still down in around Panama City I mean many even emergency officials don't have phones that work um so it you know it's a big problem people can call their relatives to say they're okay um and and it's I think has to be one of the things that's really slowing down the rescue and relief effort\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from

Navarro\nThe midterms are less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate the house and many will also choose governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the geo Pete is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break 'em down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors\nThey haven't really good chance they could pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats\nAnd this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them what\nStates are you watching heading into this last month the campaign I mean where they're really tight races\nSome a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I\nSay some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida's always you know the ...\nOr Florida and Georgia Florida's always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa's it's going to be I think are really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams will be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that the state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the Midwest and in the sun belt um Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but\nThen Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by five super education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican or some polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally he only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but what's surprising and notable for us\nFor but what's surprising a notable for Republicans and how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott or off favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that\nSort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you\nAbolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the call gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but you don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining to take it up in Congress\nAnd yet progressive activists have won a number of victories convincing local governments to stop detaining immigrants and their jails for the federal immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that cats with member station WNYC reports\nIn Hudson County New Jersey a routine contract renewal turned into a political firestorm\nTo the issue was a deal the county has with immigration and Customs Enforcement agency pays the county to house immigrants picked up by federal authorities more than half of the inmates at the Hudson County jail or ice detainees activists urge local\nThese activists urge local legislators to pull out of the contract last week one of them called Schwartz other counties shouldn't profit from President Trump's immigration crackdown\nBecause you'd night you can you do have power and it may not be a lot and maybe for one county in one eight over one did anything better but if we can get anything got down here and I think county we can do what we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five ten sours Hudson County voted to end the eyes contract but not until twenty twenty that way to county would have time to replace the tens of millions of dollars it gets from ice\nThe all democratic ... as the county legislators in New Jersey or known a short residents that action would be taken here's Anthony Romano\nIs a strong possibility we will be phased out is it [noise] so it's not just rhetoric\nAcross the country local officials are responding to anti ISIS activism in California Contra Costa county Sacramento County and the city of Santa Ana I pulled out of their contracts with ice in Williamson County Texas a detention center will no longer hold immigrants\nAnd in Atlanta the mayor issued an executive order to stop accepting ice detainees\nBut all of this is not happening without push back\nYour job is an attack of town\nYvonne balls or a lifelong resident of Hudson County accused officials of putting immigrants ahead of us citizens she says the ice money helps to keep her taxes low some immigrant advocates also opposed ending the contract they warned of unintended consequences Brian ...

conditions for immigrants before the end of the contract the gel has been plagued by problems suicides poor medical care bad food several former detainees testified at the hearing last week visited
