Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire\nSince a Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate and assemble that's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region and she'll be with us\nMy pleasure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nClimbing governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many events issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and ah and king self and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents [noise]\nAnd those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society and trying to figure out\nThose are members of civil society\nTrying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east in American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract this much I think leverage is possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activist and the others and so there clearly not the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending a you know uh this one man jumped on and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important important important price uh from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey a what would what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated debt\nOr they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange innate investment than he'd investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with ... with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWe can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult [noise] uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looked like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University

and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been had it on this has published an exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version they're Mexican Government said that the army and the fact that I Believe they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends these W she'll start eat what I have seen all these years four years of investigation\nBeing all these years four years of investigation is that all the official ... is our ally is not true its ally [noise] so tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the for the police not just where not these about wild west happening that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just these\nEven more I have reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up all these white chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the I was before that that\nSo the federal police and the

bus has disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside buff is\nWhy they did was just too and so these two bosses what exactly they are two bosses that the army and they said that police start to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before it I mean these two bosses was that the boss is where the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students the than now it\nFor the army and for the police they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims\nOf circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what these west side really tragic accident they didn't\nThese wise that are really tragic accident they didn't know\nHow you know that heroin was hitting on that bus [noise]\nI was

[noise] um\nMe about this demonstration and put it into some context was this a surprising turn out for a ...\nUm say the organizers say there was about seven hundred thousand people that are in the metro simply said ... confirmed the numbers but sense and they ... as you said hundreds of thousands of people by and that was well above what the organizes on the police and I think the media themselves expected\nI'm so huge China from people rights across\nBritain and our ... she's coming down from Scotland\nPeople flying in from Northern Ireland coming in for whales that even people from your effort to from Germany France and eight today that traveled to London for the march so you know some of the city's most famous street people marching past that would ban has like been Brexit\nBrexit stole my future people wrapped up in a huge flags\nKind of children in ... with ease flags face paint on and it's kind of very British thing for people like to\nTake the dog ... um that I Love dogs with that kind of dressed up in a you out but we live on the radio and I I'm not the dog didn't look about happy about that but yeah lots of lots of ... and has a real of a lot of young people on the smallest with you there especially people that couldn't vote in the last referendum ... they were too young\nAnd they were the ones saying that's what I being they think that being saddled with a mess basically which is severely affecting ... so a lot of them are really pushing for all these people buy on any kind of ... that deal the British Government um agreed\nWell ... is another referendum even possible I mean we have these very chaotic negotiations um the prime minister they're really struggling to hammer out a deal um it is a vote possible\nSo legally if possible we could have ... uh the prime minister Theresa May have said\nThat's not going to be another ... but that could be one technically however it would take months and months to plan a second vote to get all the legislation in place and she said at the beginning what a ... to leave in March they probably if there was going to be a some kind of peace\nThat I ... in place and he thought the getting what effort sneak you to leave in March\nThey probably if I Walk and be some kind of people that it would have to ban that the day and not would have to be put back for the British Government would have to agree to that and all the other countries in the ... I Try and keep up and all that kind of [noise]\nYeah it would have to agree to during that so it's a it's a big asking this amount of time reading\nThat's the b._b._c. Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests\nThere's more at stake in the state house races and purely local concerns and that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his productions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats\nAnd that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be ... and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nMight have said they're just going to maybe ... just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states\nCats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states that were really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad potholes\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nConnecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases\nHave traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nA lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nWe'd Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard Nixon's Saturday Night massacre President Nixon had up ended the Justice Department having let go of his attorney general deputy attorney general and the special counsel investigating the Watergate scandal\nPresident Trump is vocally frustrated with Robert Mueller's investigation so could it happen again here's Ron Elving NPR senior editor and correspondent

we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view the way politicians express or suppressed their identities\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas in a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival down overworked has long used for\n\nCruz himself hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nWas your name is Raphael you know you go by kid that's an angle sized version of it he went the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA tests\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example here's our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we can over you decide that they can\nBring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them and were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading best\nStill matters in the world whether in her man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut it matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em to seriously other many political context um [noise]\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say maybe that the most important thing for them is that they should uh be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who is best for you and other grounds so you have to balance it out\nIs the role of identity and politics and how should politicians approach in and talked about it without either alienating or collapsing\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly constantly [laughter] I I think you can easily go wrong hair I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive why\nAnd that leads down a terrible road because once you've created essay racial divisions it takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds\nAnd um it's a temptation for politicians around the world and and you know well through the twenty century they're drawing people together a through making them feel ashamed of hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now\nThe labels conservative and liberal are\nAssociated with sort of tribal feelings with a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election results and then whoever\nOr you lose the sense that in election reserved and then whoever wins or when you sort of gather behind in order to run the country is\nConcerned do you I mean I'm I'm hearing a real noticed concern um that identity um and the politics around it has been weaponized and and it's certainly\nI think I think it is wearing I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities then we are around policies\nSo that if we just don't using our identity divides we could probably come to reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us\nBecause of the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is not coming together but losing\nLosing to the other side\nAnd in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nYeah now the question is whether you could do that with what your cold Rodney weaponized identity\nAnd I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies democracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity as she makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University

weekend edition from NPR News I'm Luke ... good morning\nIt's been a long road to get to this milestone in Afghanistan there were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats\nI'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years\nAnd the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul dozens or dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is reporter Jennifer glass she is in Kabul thanks for being with us get to be here and they live\nSo were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep\nAway you know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he detonated his explosive vest outside\nOr in the north there was shelling and couldn't use we know that they burned down one polling center outside of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local ...\nOf conducive city and there's been some irregularities as well one local

governance and announced its arrested a ... a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful science though this time around as the number of women running right over four hundred what will just\nMean they are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that\nHas held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things and just briefly what is it signified\nOf the vote was held after so very long it's always important to remind people that this is a country and conflict to conflict at the United states is involved and\nIt is and there was a lot of controversy about whether this vote should be held at all but Afghan officials were adamant and international officials were adamant that they were going forward this vote and I think today they might be happy with their decision more than three million of eight point eight million registered voters coming out there\nThree million of eight point eight million registered voters coming out there trying to show that the that Afghanistan is making progress and the battles insurgents around the

Navarro\nSaudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire since a Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate and assemble ... is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region and so being with us\nMy pleasure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nFarming governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty at many events issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and ah and king self and of course that the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of a lot of fear a lot of worry that the people who are active\nAnd of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of a lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion a main fact to be threatened now are there is a real great too I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\n[laughter] you're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking information it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very calculated the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison to many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not the beacon of liberal democracy in the region\nWhat they've been able to play this role of of basically defending a you know uh this one man javahn and of course uh it really extracting I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey a what would what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they are facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that\nUh they need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange the need investment investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by other allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the ins or to one was very clear\nCan't be provided by other allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the Atlanta or to was very clear about that and so it really depends on now countries with with with liquidity\nI and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult [noise] uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to hold sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was the best and among many a political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty four teams students from the teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we're presumed killed in and around the town of ...\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very asleep blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups in the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been had it on this has published an exhaustive look into the events of that and I had her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version the Mexican government said that the army and they say that I Believe they didn't know anything about what the west\nAnd they say that I Believe they didn't know anything about what was happening and they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends be seized official store to eat what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official ... is our ally is not true its ally [noise]\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the for the police not just where not these about wild west happening that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just these\nEven more I have reports on the show to report that proves that the army ... white chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the worse before that that\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive near while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move that to both is where they were transferred dating inside to the CD\n[noise] to be able to take the more buses mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to the protest to Mexico City so they went to both the station\nThey do do that you bosses and when their students were trying to escape unborn obese by bus\nWhen their students were trying to escape unborn obese by buses ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staple east is that to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're all ... of that back way to process\nFrom these two buses disappeared all day for a three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students on the buses disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside boss is that good was just too\nAnd so these two versus what exactly they are two bosses that the army and they for the police it starts to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses would that do bosses where the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students didn't know it\nFor the army and if the police they knew it so the ...\nAnd if the police they knew it\nSo these

very long time to explain his death and many details at those explanations and seem difficult to believe but the president wants to give the kingdom the benefit of the doubt well the Senate allow that\nWell the Senate needs to have a a very intense discussion about this because uh basically President Trump is a giving a sense that this was a credible story this half ... half baked story\nAh they um instead of sending a powerful message about American support for human rights and and free press I mean this uh it just seems like almost like our ministry Asian tripping his regime is working hand in hand with the Saudi Government to take a very serious situation and tried to dismiss it\nWhat should the response be what you got powerful message be\nWell the message to start by saying this story is completely unacceptable is full of every kind of Hall's not given it any sort of of credibility and that we have to get to the bottom of everything that that happened\nSecond is we need to realize that this is this is one piece of a broader set of issues we have to address a prior to the incident in the consulate the Saudis were using an intense a team of folks on Twitter\nTo discredit crush Yogi and and other dissidents or around the world\nAnd furthermore they are involved in this or a horrific war in Yemen where we are actually assisting them and this is a situation where you

Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\nA\nLittle more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash scheduled I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state well\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican tickets\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be ... and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or a U.S house seat might have\nSo they're just going to maybe boat just on the party line\nOr U.S House seat might have said they're just going to maybe ... just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two state to a really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad pothole\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same as you\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah\nThe taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue\nYeah but taxes are a big issue there to\nTaxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the ... the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happen in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nLead Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday

weekend edition from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro good morning it's been a long road to get to this milestone in Afghanistan there were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats\nI'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years\nAnd the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul dozens or dead but the vote went on and to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is a reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us get to be here live\nSo were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away\nYou know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we've really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he detonated his explosive vests outside\nOr in the north there was shelling including Jews we know that they burned down one polling center outside of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of cobble a brought his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent\nOther people from getting to the polling stations so\nNot by far the cleanest elections the Afghan government announced its arrested a ... a few days\nThe Afghan government announced its arrested a ... a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around is the number of women running right over four hundred what will\nJust mean they are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that\nHas held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things and just\nBriefly what is it signified of the vote was held after so very long it's always important to remind people that this is a country in conflict to conflict at the United states is involved in\nIt is and there was a lot of controversy about whether this vote should be held at all\nBut Afghan officials were adamant and international officials were adamant that they were going for with this vote and I think today they might be happy with their decision\nMore than three million of eight point eight million registered voters coming out there trying to show that the that Afghanistan is making progress as a battles insurgents around the country the Taliban are resurgent Islamic state was against the vote and yet still Afghans came

expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region and so being with us\nMy pleasure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nClimbing governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty at many events issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and the un kings and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worry that the people who are active as journalists dissidents [noise]\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion a main fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence service\nUm the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking information it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very calculated the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not the beacon of liberal democracy in the region what they've been able to play this role of of basically defending a\nYou know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really extracting I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey a what would what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they are facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that\nThey need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange the need investment investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult\nThe power playing out well in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult [noise] uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was ... a political scientist at

ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of ...\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very slowly blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been had it on this has published an exhaustive look into the events of that and I had her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version they're Mexican Government said that the army and if it ... they didn't know anything about whether it was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends these W she'll start eat what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official better showing satellite is not too\nIs that all the official ... is our ally is not true it's a lie so tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the ... not just where not these about wild west happening that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just these even more\nI had reports on the show to report that\nProves that the army and if it up all these white chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the worse before that so the federal police and the army were chasing the students how the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for them then the students decide to move that two bosses where they were transport dating inside to the CD\n[noise] to be able to take the more versus mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to the protest to Mexico City so they went

that to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're all ... of that back where to process\nMhm they they're always at the end of that back way to process from these two buses disappeared

disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling in spy boss is\nWhy they did was just too I'm not so these two bosses where exactly that two bosses that the army and they said that police start to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before it I mean these two bosses was that the boss is where the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss the secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students the ...\nFor the army and if the police they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims of circumstance they had\nThey had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what these guys that are really tragic\nAccident they didn't know how do you\n...
