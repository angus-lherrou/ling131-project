thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi or explanation by the president of how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nHow much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nWashington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response to it let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council\nSecond lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis the end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to ... the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid unborn society\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to a\nPoint of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then\nJust killed and in Turkey that Mr Putin's denial of it a lecture and interference in our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAnd we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the in the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral\nValue of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just to expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments of that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can\nFind ways to put pressure on the Saudis that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've ... top two weeks is unacceptable even colder thank you thank you\nSo during for profit is it new you probably remember hatred mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War\nBut American mercenaries working for foreign powers that something that ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news and joins us in our studios thanks so much for being with us like you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about during restoration such demand\nFor the last Seventeen years seals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have X\nThis is an other parts of the U.S government have excelled at this modern style of warfare at uh the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that said the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of the changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and uh we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is mhm but\nYour investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden in twenty Fifteen\nThese special forces and and see veterans Navy SEAL veterans' day deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the eight and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen as soon as long as the party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political leader does he\nAnd Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebel\nSaudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should just in the story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was reservists and he was a seal reservists he he was at that level of of command of one of the the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had his top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nI guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that you are citizens couldn't do that there are laws that govern whether the U.S whether you as\nIndividuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nOr you've seen how Americans have served in the French ah well I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are not ... a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during World War II sure right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries\nBut I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the Taliban or somebody with fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is against the law ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\nIs this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or they're the only ones who've done this or the other countries who try it's um are there other Americans other than the ones and\nIt's um are there other Americans other than the ones and other Americans who believe you've uncovered yet right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm gonna keep on looking at it and\nI've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working as Secret Service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work\nWell there's several reasons one is there's a lot of money involved but\nThey also argue they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the UAE he's doing U.S policy the U.S has not spoken out against the war in Yemen we fuel airplanes we sell them bombs we sell them guns we train them we can do to train them\nTheir argument is they're doing what the you you know basically the U.S U.S foreign policy anyway\nSo they they suggest you which patriotism yes his era must an investigative

of addiction can be just about any face\nAn obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of smiling face of metal Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from its perch on her back that photo shoot a good day for Maddie\nBut she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old introduction continental highschool party a drug took hold of her life\nShe was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and Lynch in near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary in joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you\nFirst we're [noise] we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be\nAn actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using\nInjecting heroine she tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty\nThis past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um\nThe case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program I gathered\nYeah she tried many [noise]\nWhat made you ... or\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and sit and not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted now um we carry the hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nI also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier to recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about Matty with her son in her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nUnderstand there's going to be a service for ... some day there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing Bonnie rate song she's just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more of that kind of sharing on Sunday\nWhat bunny rich on man [noise] I Can't make you love me\nIndeed I don't know\nNeal wrote about her sister Maddy Lynch in there and the Vermont were seven days thank

have now abandoned\nIts intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual and that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales President Trump made that clear this week while\nHe was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this

that clear this week by spelling out his agenda like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about Kavanaugh the caravan law and order and common sense\nAnd the president and other

Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the United states so the president is using them to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop\nAs for law and order that's the phrase is oldest states' rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally to all but the phrase has also been used\nAs

substituting right now for the border wall which the president has made the symbol of his immigration policy and much more and which so far he has not been able to build\nAll be noted uh it does seem

sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier

and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nWashington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut

countries\nHow the U.S response to let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United

supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to ... the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries um to\nA point of value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and

the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week\nIt included a photo of a smiling face of metal to Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for muddy but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old when production ... high school party a drug too cold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and Lynch in mere died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her\nSister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me first we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing I she wanted to be\nAn actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe had a long time to run it\nBut what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using\nInjecting heroine she tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie\nThis past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we're all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um\nDisappeared again drove more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nKnow it never really occurred to me not to share ... addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lift and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted now um we carry the hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nAnd our hope also now lives with policymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for a highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about a Matty with her son and her ... in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\n[noise] understand there's going to be a service for ... there is yeah or were you and your family\nMatty on Sunday there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWhile through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing Bonnie rate songs he's just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and not spend a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more is that kind of sharing on Sunday\nWhat

but President Trump's priorities often reflect his interest as senior editor and correspondent NPR's Ron Elving can tell us Ron thanks so much for being with us\nGood to be with he's got let's begin to of course with the president's reaction to the Saudi explanation as it stands now it's been in several different places for the past couple of weeks for the death of ... or the president calls it credible lodge and Congress don't\nSaudis say he was killed in a fist fight with Fifteen men\nAny child in any school yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of the story the Saudis have now abandoned its intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual\nAnd that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales President Trump made that clear this week while\nHe was seated with the executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is focused\nBut president made that clear this week by spelling out is gender like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about Kavanaugh the caravan law and order and common sense\nAnd a president and other Republicans have been treating Brett Kavanaugh as a martyr even though he was in fact confirmed and is in fact on the Supreme Court now the caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to\nGo far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the United states so the president is using them to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop as for law and order that's the phrase is older states rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally to all but the phrase has also been used\nAs code for resistance to social change and common sense is another familiar phrase a recently used as a political cultural\nBy the Tea Party as you mentioned round the caravans been a feature of the the rallies that President Trump has been addressing but\nHe's also threatened to withhold some foreign aid over it has me yes the stopping the caravan and the threat of\nWithheld assistance is substituting right now for the border wall which the president has made the symbol of his immigration policy and much more and which so far he has not been able to build\nAll be noted uh it does seem those at the polls have tightened in recent days I haven't they yes\nSome of the polls have tightened down for a variety of reasons among them that this is October and that's what the polls usually do in the month before an election especially if we've seen one party or the other getting well ahead in the early fall in October that lead shrinks sometimes that means a close election\nSometimes it doesn't but the more lightly attached voters in either party tend to come home in October and that's been especially true of Republicans in recent years\nSupport

administration's appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nIt took the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space\nThis week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on his face at least a friendly visit three on for talks with both the king and crown prince Pompeo told reporters on his return to the U.S the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nWe have a long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n... is right about that for decades us presidents from both parties who felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly enlist in residence at the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nTrump has no artifice about him so he's quite up front about this sort of transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed or inhibit it to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military those are the biggest orders in the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states the kingdom as pledged forty five billion dollars to help it\nStates the kingdom is pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like ... than lucid motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard in Georgetown and foreign policy think tanks here in Washington\nEven before the Saudis acknowledged ... death some recipients were trying to distance themselves from the kingdom's money but it's not easy says Rachel process and author of the book sicker than oil America's uneasy partnership with Saudi Arabia\nThey invest in long term goals they invest in real estate they've been lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions in art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both us and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War of the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on that front is mixed former President Obama took a step back from the Saudis as part of his diplomatic overture to Iran but Bronson says Trump has embraced the kingdom more tightly than ever\nThe Trump Administration has put all of their ... and they've been very very public about that\nTrump has sided with Saudi Arabia and its regional fight with cutter and encourage the very public romance between his son in law Jared Kushner and the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nAs the president said yesterday before the Saudis acknowledged ... death that makes it tough for Trump to crack down now say maybe as many great\nIs that is why this is so\nAs as well this is so\nSad but\nBronson says Saudi Arabia was all ready backsliding on its pledges of modernization which is part of what made ... so critical\nWhich I'm On a show he represented for many of us was this belief in managed change in Saudi Arabia which is very slow he could be patient and he he expected to be patient about when he didn't expect with the reversal that he was seeing with ... in some

have excelled\nAt this modern style of warfare at uh the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's

reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have

sources told us even when he was doing this very\nA top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know I guess I Am among

listen foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced in what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nOr you've seen how Americans have served in the French uh I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces and these are not Maryland\nAnd lots of a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during World War II sure\nRight yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you then join a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is ... ... this is a buzzfeed story\nNot an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it [noise] um is this an anecdote or a trend\nRight is this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or oh

happening in in theaters around the world I'm going to keep on looking at it and\nI've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working as Secret Service agents

and to see the child the diving driving under these circumstances with this world famous case is obviously enormous the gratifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we may\nHelp us understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors didn't hear\n[noise] yeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three ... we would give this child HIV back the other thing we had to wait is that the child had been on a waiting list for and live a diner\nThe child to being on a waiting list for liver Darnah for three times the average and the child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated\nAnd we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV what did the parents children\n[noise] so the parents were saying to us\nWhy ... nights where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy wouldn't you consider us so they were sick need that to wish from the parents and the mom particularly who was the Darnah that she could be in Darnah and we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promote sending harms the autonomy of our patients as far as possible\nSo it was interesting that in this case it was very much motivated by a request from the very brave sets of parents who wanted to save the life of their child\nGoing through juice in this uh this case the more people know about it we'll look contribute something to lifting the stigma they try to be in so many countries around the world\nWould like to her so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted so for us in South Africa although we have this very well integrated national um aids treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in normal life then that should preclude you from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you for having those\nYou from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you for having those options that HIV negative people would have\nAnd we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this that that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma\nThat carried Etheridge medical bioethicist at Vince Donald Gordon medical center in Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us thank you

G died while visiting the Saudi conflict in Turkey on October second\nAfter weeks of denials they say some kind of fight broke out shortly after Mr ... who lived in Virginia and wrote columns for the Washington Post arrived at the embassy that day to complete paperwork for his marriage President Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing he did not\nCriticized the Saudis and beer Don Gonyea was with the president on the campaign twin out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saudis the Saudis announced a confirmed\nThe obvious mister show jihad died\nOr in their custody the president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step but it's a big step to a lot of people a lot of people involved it I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people Trump's referring to the tune of ...\nI'm a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what\nElse did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called cause showed used at the unacceptable but also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWorth a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution a cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact checks as is the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting uh give given up quickly in the past\nHe has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like eh not so with the Saudis now all of this comes up its\nPresident is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talk about how does he present\nLater today what does the president talk about how does he present his argument at his rallies\nHe is really trying to get the base his hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle to confirm justice Brett Kavanaugh calls Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh an unhinged\nAngry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and ah\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of a ...\nAnd here's John ... thanks very much for being with us thank you got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death of Jamal controlled gee\nWe turn now to even adult or he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us glad to be based on all of your experience does the Saudi explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than they kind of complete thorough and transparent\nYou know I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise\nRather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response to let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies at first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits\nAnd the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries um to a point of value and that is not the most effective way to do\nOh yes the export of democracy to foreign countries to a\nPoint of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we do with them it does not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that\nDo not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we're getting from top two weeks is unacceptable uber gold or thank you thank you\nInstead of your brats 'cause

Simon\nWe've learned over the past few years the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any face\nAn obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of smiling face of metal Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for Maddie but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old introduction cotton at a high school party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and Lynch in near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me first we're we're sorry thank you\nWhat can you tell us about your sister\nThank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be\nAn actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using\nInjecting heroine she tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty\nThis past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again for drug ... more than ...\nOut and she sort of um\nDisappeared again drove more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this and you're a bridge or\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and certain not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted now um we carried out for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive\nOpiate based pain killer but to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier to recover\nThat stigma and shame or a huge barrier to recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her use and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service from ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWhile through song of course they'll be performances and we actually have a\nA video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate songs he's just sitting in the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more of that kind of sharing on Sunday\n... rich on
