lots of folks without power and the situation seems particularly dire in Panama City and some of the smaller towns in Bay county along the Gulf of Mexico\nThere in Panama City there's no water no power and no gas most gas stations are still closed 'em and and as you head out of town to find the stations that do have gas or very long lines\nMany folks have evacuated from this region but for those who stayed behind it is getting increasingly difficult just to find the basics like to find food and and to find water\nAnd you were in Panama City yesterday I gather which which would like

when he says loved ones are missing or can contact them it's a it's true that cell phones are not working very well not only in Panama City but all over bay county so it remains really difficult to communicate and find relatives who may have stayed behind in the storm\nBut still you do get the feeling that the number of fatalities is going to go up and maybe way up when we start to get more

us about your face which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a face has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has that effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you know\nIt hurt reading the report because I was reading about these parishes that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and whatnot but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was the early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was a thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ... and a church or face\nI think that's a difficult

to tell no\nI did not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with do you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who had been\nHarmed it certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops and people whose names are plastered up on church buildings back in my area hearing that they spent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up\nJust to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for\nThe heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever was involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area and starting a new a new part of my life and since

was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home\nAnd books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now\nBut that right only practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the terror that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't really think so to the outside\nWorld your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know when I was around nine or ten\nShe started to uh with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police why people would be even a harsher and those beatings just things started to give progressive Lee worst\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life\nFrom our town and her partner also started to get progressive

looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing a ...\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the baby in June dirt from your mother the beatings the she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that as I was gonna say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just traumatic thing but I Will say\nLayers of particular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I\nThink led to me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em an individual you started to start as a way of attempt in the high end tempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of veer between of which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something right\nNow the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball and the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days\nAnd there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lotta times that starvation and I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police as I get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay like people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body ...\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life oh man\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how did that Andrew your life oh man\nI'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overused ... wrote from not sleeping and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to their brought me some sort of Philly was gambling and so every since then I made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and it was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi and so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame\nWhen we show people into people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to keep right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the white told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I Want it to drive back home that two hours feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually do the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse or addiction the gambling both as my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now why do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and\nTalk to your mother now why do you hear what she thinks oh I Love my mother to death\nAnd I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher and my mother not love me enough to instill a practice\nAt an early age and his books in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing can save and I don't know if\nThat's true but I Know I'm a writer Norman America and read it and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I'm trying to do with this book\nHere

Virginia resident and you're right there are a number of things that we could do I'll tell you what I focus on the first thing the Senate did this week the members of the Foreign Relations committee on which I said is we sent a letter to the president to trigger\nIs a review of whether this treatment of trauma show you violate something called the Magnitsky Act Magnitsky Act\nAllows the White House to put sanctions on individuals if they engage in human rights abuses when we send a letter it triggers a hundred and twenty day investigative period where the administration has to report back to Congress as to whether there have been a human rights violation and what they're going to do about it that's number one\nNumber two um we have been in the Senate increasingly concerned about Saudi Arabia and working to potentially seesaw\nWe have been in the Senate increasingly concerned about Saudi Arabia and working to potentially cease arms sales to then we had a vote a few months ago were forty seven of us\nVoted to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of their mishandling of the civil war in Yemen and the massive humanitarian crisis there so a second thing that you are likely to see I think Senator Paul and Murphy\nHave talked about this is additional action to block arms sales President Trump reacted very negatively that the other day you'll see that and then the final one is us support for the for the Saudis and the UAE the war in Yemen and I think there is increasingly a desire to just\nA cease us support\nFor the war in Yemen which is a massive humanitarian disaster so I think before we get into embassy diplomatic relations we've had a long standing relationship with Saudi Arabia but I think there are there Magnitsky arms sales and support for the war in Yemen\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed of financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement more at alliance for lifetime income data work\nFrom the three I O T powering enterprise digital transformation with artificial intelligence predictive analytics and diabetes solutions learned more it see three I O T dot AI and from the listeners who support this NPR station\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon hurricane Michael several records when it came ashore this week on Florida's panhandle it was the most powerful hurricane ever in that part of Florida and brought nearly an eight foot storm surge that's an area in Appalachia cola that's at the heart of Florida's oyster industry\nNPR's Greg Allen visited the area and filed this report Appalachian coal\nThe area and filed this report Appalachian coal is a small city just a few thousand people\nBut it's tight knit and self reliant on friday two days after the storm makes your restaurant was in full swing on a downtown St hadn't gotten meals hamburgers sausages chicken Mac and cheese Lindsey shepherd says people in restaurants in town donated food we\nYesterday to not sit around and get\nA lot of times on in the community\n... Johnson who's lived here for two years since Appalachian coal is community that takes care of itself look around and she said you don't see one city official or county officials here\nThe people here we are a community of individually and people who survive on the edge of everything here we're a hundred miles from anything and that's why we're here we like it it's a lovely wonderful can\nPeople have to get here\nAfter hurricane Michael accessibility was a problem the storm surge washed out entire sections of the main coastal road highway Ninety eight it also temporarily forced the closure of a bridge that links Appalachian coal live with its neighbor East Point\nNow the bridges reopened in this another coastal communities mandatory evacuations were ordered but many decided to stay Anthony

over three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters\nGroups are showing Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state the campus also they Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman of member station WAMC in Atlanta joined just Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe is missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about\nWith your photo ID and then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting\nYeah and of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about uh not just conventional ... vote fraud as we've known it in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we're we're we've certainly been concerned about that what is the complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following state law in his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race has meant\nShe is really going after a camp for this um she says everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy I'm On the other side ... campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis but for both candidates motivating the bases really keen\nFactored crisis but for both candidates motivating debates is really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters

Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe\nIt's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe in most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out there's some are about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you know\nYeah it hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about these parishes that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was the early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ... and a church or face\nI think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a

story to tell no I did not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with do you think the church cared more about it ... as an institution and less about the people who had been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops in people whose names are plastered up on church buildings\nBack in my area hearing that they spent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for\nThe heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever was involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new areas and starting a new a new part of my life and since

Mississippi joins us now from Oxford, Mississippi thanks so much for being with us\nThank you so much for wanting to talk to you [noise]\nWhen someone says do you tell me about your mother [laughter] it's not a simple question is it\nOh not at all not at I look forward to it to my mother's ... incredible model and like most Americans she just had a rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patches she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home\nAnd books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a writer Lee practice that I still have now\nBut that rarely practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into\nWell um [noise]\nDid not want me to write into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't really think so\nTo the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like the shards of abuse and you know when I was around nine or ten\nShe started to uh with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looked at me because when I Would face or police or why people would be even a harsher and those beatings just I think started to give progressive Lee worst\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town from her partner also started to get progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the beatings that she endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOf the things I just want to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say layers of particular kinds of abused really personal and structural I think led to me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily\nI think led to me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em any new eventually I started to start as a way of attempt in the hot and the symptom and disappear\nYeah in the book you kinda veer between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in the morning two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and as a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay like people wouldn't see me as such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body ...\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how did that Andrew your life oh man\nI'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overuse wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of Philly was gambling and so every since then I may from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in the book\nYou are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nYou're the victim in one and you're there and the sense that perpetrator and the gambling\nWhile I'm definitely the perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame\nWhen we show people into people that the money that we are able to make we aren't able to keep right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to when the when I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that two hours feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually do the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still\nCan't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher\nAt my mother not love me enough to instill a practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment\nComing full circle she really believes that reading and writing can save and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better we can be better\nUse my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better we can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I'm trying to do with this book here say lame in his book heavy and American

member station WAMC in Atlanta joined just Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe is missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID and then you can still\nTo the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting yeah and of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about\nA ... not just conventional vote fraud as we've known it in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading\nThe voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is it a complaint that show rights groups are making\nAll the groups point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race has been it\nShe is really going after a camp for this um she says everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy I'm On the other side ... campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis but for both candidates motivating the basis\nIt's just a manufactured crisis but for both candidates motivating debates is really key in this

now blamed for at least fourteen deaths NPR's Joel Rose in Miramar Beach Florida Joel thanks for being with us Hi Scott what is the situation seem like today\nWell as you mentioned there are lots of folks without power and the situation seems particularly dire in Panama City and some of the smaller towns in Bay county along the Gulf of Mexico\nThere in Panama City there's no water no power and the gas most gas stations are still closed 'em and and as you head out of town to find the stations do have gas there very long lines\nMany folks have evacuated from this region but for those who stayed behind it is getting increasingly difficult just to find the basics like to find food and and to find water\nAnd you were in Panama City yesterday I gather which which would like they're\n[noise] it's a small city about thirty seven thousand residents 'em before the storm on it's on the bay it's not directly on the Gulf of Mexico it's not all the jury's town\nIt's not directly on the Gulf of Mexico it's not a luxurious town I mean the houses are set pretty close together\nAnd right now it's like every block is is that almost like a scene from a disaster movie like their trees down there are wires in the street seems like every building sustained some kind of damage\nOr either to the roof or to the walls I mean I saw a church that was missing two of its walls and and you could just see from the pews right out into the the blue sky outside um churches schools public buildings hospitals all of this has sustained a lot of damage a and I think it's starting to really down and folks to this is going to be a very long recovery\nRight now fourteen the desks or fourteen people have been reported and confirmed but I gather nobody there are things such as that the final word\nUnfortunately no I mean I I think people do think that the death toll is likely to rise up so far officials here have been pretty tight lipped they don't want to release numbers until they've finished the search and rescue process a bay county emergency chief mark bone was asked yesterday about the number of fatalities here's what he said\nWhat we have is a lot of people missing I Want to be very careful about numbers because are they missing because their loved ones can't contact them or are they missing because they were you know perished in the store\nAnd when he says loved ones are missing or can't contact them it's a it's true that cell phones are not working very well not only in Panama City but all over bake county so it remains really difficult to communicate and find relatives who may have stayed behind in the storm\nBut still you do get the feeling that the number of fatalities is going to go up and maybe way up when we start to get more information\n... is going to go up and maybe way up when we start to get more information from the waterfront communities or you know to the south and east of Panama City places like Springfield Parker Mexico beach in Port

to be here\nTell us about your face which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I\nIn my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has that effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out there's some are about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nYeah it hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about these parishes that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was the early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was a thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ... and a church or face\n[noise] I think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church\nI don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to tell\nDo you know anyone who uh who has their own story to tell no I did not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with do you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who had been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops and people whose names are plastered up on church buildings\nBack in my area hearing that they spent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for\nThe heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in\nPreserving their own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever was involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area and starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking of of all these news stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I\nStill

now from Oxford, Mississippi thanks so much for being with us\nThank you so much for wanting to talk to you\n[noise] when someone says do you tell me about your mother [laughter] it's not a simple question is it\nOh not at all not at I look forward to it to my mother's ... incredible model and like most Americans she just had\nA rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home\nAnd books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a writer Lee practice that I still have now\nBut that right only practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the terror that I think she probably did not want me to write into\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't really think so to the outside\nAnd we do have to get to that don't really think so to the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications\nUm she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like the shards of abuse and you know when I was around nine or ten\nShe started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looked at me because when I Would face or police or why people would be even a harsher and those beatings just I think started to give progressive Lee worst\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to give progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world in our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the beatings that she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOf the things I just want to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause traumatic thing but I Will say layers of\nParticular kinds of abused really personal and structural I think led to me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other big\nLuckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em any new eventually I started to start as a way of attempt in the hot and the symptom to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of veer between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in the morning two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and has a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushed my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I've had lots of running as police as I get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay like people wouldn't see me as such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body ...\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I've made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in the book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWhile I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi\n... well I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi and so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe are unable to cheap right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through\nMy gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood my mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually do the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about\nThe physical abuse or addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still can't\nReally honestly talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now why do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and\nI'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher and my mother and not love me enough to instill\nA practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment\nOr coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing can save and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I wanted to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell
