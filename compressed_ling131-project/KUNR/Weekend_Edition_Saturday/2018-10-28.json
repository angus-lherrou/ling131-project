in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock are we getting it\nFor a moment and take stock are we getting it\nGetting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric thing also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nOr we'll Schachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the elections\nNow we came back from the precipice turning the presidential campaign but now here we're at that\nPrecipice again and it's a similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peas position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election\nThe nation attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act so we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders uh we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacists in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise] what sets this moment apart in your view\n[noise] the phenomena we're seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls from major U.S corporations we're product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society that is different and new [noise]\nI mean I Want to turn to you now I'm the Kevin of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum ... has been in the news is you know\nUm you have actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions are in the context of immigration so you are looking at how the way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed\nWe discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect on how we as individuals view an entire group of people\nAbsolutely yeah so in in one reason study with Renee floors who the sociologist at the University of Chicago we found that white Americans\nOverwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about the many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America it's\nNot hard to guess what is driving the stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is the people who are anti Trump in general also absorb this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we ... we hypothesized we would find something different that you know we have we are living in these um echo chambers where we're consuming very different news and media and we thought that that would be reflected in the types of ideas and stereotypes that that a liberal versus conservatives held and yet\nA

if you have a heroin problem in your community and I I remember thinking most impossible standard than heroin is in big cities you know was homeless population does not in rural\nAmerica for decades heroin was a big city problem but no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened in the last five years\nNow ... agrees a few years ago he was elected sheriff of ... county he toward the jails and saw that is\nVery very sick very very sick people because detox and from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can have people burned out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time around half the inmates were withdrawing from heroin it was a dangerous and expensive situation\nIt took becoming the sheriff to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts in the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had we had to change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand what is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the opioid epidemic as if it were a natural disaster the same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic\nSnow how much county is the first county in the

of that and all in coordination with each other all the same objective which is like fifty\nCoordination life safety what if they used that system of everyone working together across government

goals are really long term I mean they're going to take years decades ... is also the spokesperson for this group\nShe says the key is to be realistic\nSo she set an objective for yourself to just end

special coverage from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro we're watching a press conference is about to start in Pittsburgh this morning\nEleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people were injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning Hi Lulu\nOh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims\nWell what we know is that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nIt is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the death of those eleven people and\nFacing twenty nine federal charges and the death of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the mode of how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities\nSay the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a it as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\n[noise] put this into context for us so there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRight I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um well it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil in eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in decades\nYeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um I went to the scene this morning it was\nRight um I went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um\nAs far as I could could go and and you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials\nI'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a ... a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner and and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and\nUh people are grappling as they as they do and and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\nWhat are they mention there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um\nAnd and so uh that's just one small thing that can be\nAnd you and so that's just one small thing the communities doing to try to help Stanley's a Jewish and otherwise throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and the people are trying to make sense of it yeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n\nA incredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nUm something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the Santa God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there'd been mass shootings in recent years thinking\nSame time you know there are several other states where there'd been mass shootings in recent years think of Texas that actively carry out that's at sentences but unless the president is is calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRate and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was a you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that when you walk\nAround Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it or what are they saying about um why this might have happened well\nI I think in these situations and and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for a crime so they can prosecute investigate and so that they can\nTo the motive for a crime so they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that there is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we've said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant uh motives\nThat tells us something about why this might have happened again that's still under investigation but uh it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happens and also we'd like to know more about about the victims soon\nWe're going to bring in ... or Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara a good morning It's MORNING\nSo set the scene for us the president's response and and basically how we are actually starting this press conference now I'm willing to go there live here we don't\nOffer our most heartfelt condolences and prayers to the victims of yesterday's

in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's ah the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources\nMake all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are we getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a\nSoccer and body building and nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger or in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is we know lived in a van he hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort

start talking about Sandler he loves Hitler Hitler and we should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much thank you living\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity and politics weed and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by ... Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program\nThank you for having me so\nWe often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voter though the teen of voters are any racial minority they're presented as a model with black voters think this election\n... they're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so\nI have to eat it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nI I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election what we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because\nWe did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because\nBy ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue and in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack and so by and instead\nFocusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why but our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so there is also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut why voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and when everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also the sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media\nThere's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things than fit when you're trying to discuss some of these racial divisions in this country\n[noise] one I Would clearly argue we're all biased I think the way that we covered the election showed that biased to be very glaring clear because we were ignoring miserably with voters on the ground were saying right ... voters on the ground where say\nNo I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt and we're like no no they don't know what they're talking about ... ...\nWe're broadcasting from the University of Nevada Reno this was eighty eight point seven or Ninety One point seven tell you when our Reno Ninety One point five K.

NPR News San Pedro Sula Honduras or\nWell now going to take a look at this moment when things are feeling frankly scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock\nAre we getting it getting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric thing also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and Carolyn Lucas Meyer is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from that precipice during the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at that precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting republic\nAttack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peas position on health care [noise]\nDefinitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\n[noise] there is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders uh we've had moments of turmoil I'm thinking of you know white supremacist in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise]\nWhat sets this moment apart in your view [noise]\nThe phenomena are we seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls from major U.S corporations we have product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society that is different and new\n[noise] I mean I I Want to turn to you now I'm Kevin of Central Americans many of them\nSee you know I'm the Kevin of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum has been in the news is you know\nI'm you've actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions are in the context of immigration a so you are looking at how the way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect\nOn how we as individuals\nView an entire group of people absolutely yeah so in\nIn one reason study with Renee floors he's a\nSociologist at the University of Chicago we found that white Americans overwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite\nBut when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about the many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America\nIt's not hard to guess what is driving the stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is the people who are anti Trump in general also absorb this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we ... we

mail this is a fraud political moment and here to help us make sense of it as NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson good morning thanks for having me [noise]\nSo obviously I'm a terrible news out of Pittsburgh we got the names of those who I'm actually were killed by this in this attack\nI'm actually were killed by this in this attack\nYeah let's just make a few things clear this was the worst anti Semitic attacking us history it occurred just days after the largest\nAssassination attempt on political leaders in this case all Democrats and targets of the president's in us history and we're not going to have the big debate about whether extreme rhetoric including some of the president's rhetoric\nHelped insight this but the president has made a lot of unifying statements he said these acts were evil he has also\nGone on to campaign and hold rallies kind of partisan politics as usual although he said that he's going to try to tone it down a little bit and he did but just before a rally in Illinois over the weekend he had this to say about his tone\nI Would like to be able to have its own that I have because I feel very strongly about it\nAnd I'd have a much different tone frankly if the press was\nEven handed Russia was fair I'd have a much different tone all the time\nSo in other words the press is still at fault but as I said we're going to have a big debate about whether some of the president's words helped create the climate for these kinds of attacks he's not responsible for the acts of crazy people\nBut there's what the president says and then there's what people here you know the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted without evidence that George Soros was funding the caravan he talks about global is a lot and in the right wing media like bright\nGlobal is a lot and in the right wing media like Breitbart the Daily Caller global list is a synonym for Jew\n... this is a president who has not really embrace the role of United and chief\nNo he doesn't believe in that other presidents have seen their role as sort of the moral leader of the nation but he doesn't believe in that I don't think he'll change he's over Seventy years old and this kind of extreme rhetoric has worked for him he believes it energizes his base\nHis closing argument in this election is based on race and fear of crime fear of immigration and it's kind of a social media business model you know the algorithms that YouTube and and other social media organizations know that more extreme content keeps viewers\nOn longer and this is what the president feels works for his base and that he might tone it down a little bit but I don't think he's going to give it up\nAs you know mid term elections are just over a week away well the events of this past week affect the elections and if so how\nI think for the most part the fundamentals of this election are set they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races leaning towards Republicans in the house the trend seems to be leading towards Democrats I think the biggest way this might affect\nThe elections is that it crowds out talk about politics the president has complained about this he said Republicans were honor roll we had momentum now all the media wants to talk about are these in quotes bombs\nSo that might be the biggest effect\nNPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson ... thank you so much thank you\nThis morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week\nAbout the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case she's or say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida at the morning\nIt's MORNING with the [noise] All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are we getting a picture of how he became this extreme\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen you had a very troubled life lots of arrests\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and bodybuilding night life and then two years ago all this anger a in a political anger starts coming out in in ...\nGr a in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is we know lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale in Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nIt's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I begin making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and in Soros in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you've spoken with coworkers including one who was in that town [noise] [noise] yeah\n... was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWhat satellites that left me last Hitler Hitler and we should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much thank you lose the leading up to the midterms is election season we've been looking at what voters will find on their ballots the governor's races the different kinds of ballot measures well we just got today and one more Sunday before election day so it's time to look at\nWell we just got today and one more Sunday before election day so it's time to look at the two biggies house and Senate well do the Senate first and we'll do it with NPR lead political editor and medical to narrow good morning to medical good morning ...\nA third of the seats in the senator up as the constitution requires Democrats were facing some tough mass but then we started hearing about a blue wave how's that water looking\nWell look the blue wave is certainly real but it's more likely to be in the house then in the Senate and that's because in the Senate there are a lot more uh seats that are held by Democrats in red or states that are up you have the worst landscape since the direct election of senators\nIn Nineteen fourteen for either party that's because you have twenty six Democrats that are defending seats and just nine Republicans so will the Republicans pick up seats and\nIt's very possible in fact a you know some handicappers are looking at a potential a best case scenario for Democrats being net even right now it's fifty one forty nine in the Senate\nAnd a more likely scenario something like two to three seats lost from when I talk to Democrats at the beginning of the cycle and through this cycle they were hoping to sort of be able to hold serve so that they could have a better landscape and twenty Eighteen where they could go on all sides\nThe best target for Democrats is in Nevada with Dean Heller and Heller is actually started to do a lot better a lot of those Republican a defense is a lot of those those Senate seats or Arizona Tennessee Texas Nevada they all started to try and a little bit more Republican in recent weeks while Democrats like Heidi Heitkamp\nA are not looking so good Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Democrats are really really hoping that in Indiana Joe Donnelly can hold that John ...\nReally hoping that in Indiana Joe Donnelly can hold that Jon Tester in Montana can hold and that Joe Manchin of West Virginia can to I'm going to have to bring up Florida because that's where I'm from uh what are you seeing there it's such an interesting ways\nYeah Florida is one of those races the Democrats are starting to feel a little bit better about you have the incumbent\nThere a Bill Nelson and they're feeling better about it

conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity and politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me [noise]\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters\n... but when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true yeah\nAnd and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so I've\nThey're all in some sense right white is the default so\nI have to eat it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also just a accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\n[noise] what are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people\n[noise] well I I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because\nBy ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue and in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack and so by and instead\nFocusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nWay politicians may not explicitly say white but our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics Oh absolutely\nThe words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and when everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously that most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nSo how did those two things then sent when you're trying to discuss some of these racial um divisions in this country\n[noise] one I Would clearly argue we're all biased\nI think the way that we covered the election showed that biased to be very glaring clear\nBecause we were ignoring literally where voters on the ground were saying right ... voters on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt\nAnd we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about ... ... it's it's\nEconomic anxiety so that's biased but also when we talk about fairness is it fair is it accurate to say you're talking about suburban voters if in fact you were only talking about\nSay you're talking about suburban voters if in fact you were only talking about a segment of those voters were white to me that is not fair it's not fair to all of the people in a country that at this point is about forty percent non white who we are rendering invisible and our coverage\nNicole Anna Jones of the New York times magazine thank you so much thank you very much for

have steadily declined since deporting the country more than two weeks ago\nSome of dropped out some state in Mexico and others have been deported she reports many have landed back in the place where

twelve people were gathering here at the bus station ready to head north\nBy nightfall thousands were on buses out of this violence city more than a third of the country's homicides are committed

Kahn NPR News San Pedro Sula Honduras\nWell now going to take a look at this moment when things are feeling frankly scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock are we getting it\nGetting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric and also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nOr we only Schachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign that\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from the precipice during the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at the precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peas position on healthcare\nAbout the geo peas position on health care [noise]\nDefinitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric [noise]\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders oh we've had moments of turmoil I'm thinking of you know white supremacist in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise]\nWhat sets this moment apart in your view [noise]\nThe phenomena we're seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls for major U.S corporations we have product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society that is different and new [noise]\nMean I Want to turn to you now I'm the Kevin of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum ... has been in the news is you know um you live actually\n... has been in the news is you know I'm you've actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions are in the context of immigration a so you are looking at how\nThe way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect\nOn how we as individuals view an entire group of people absolutely yeah so in\nIn one recent study with Renee floors he's a sociologist at the University of Chicago we found that\nWhite Americans overwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about the many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America\nIt's not hard to guess what is driving the stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is the people who are anti Trump in general also absorb this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we ... we hypothesized we would find something different that you know we have we are living in these um echo chambers wherever consuming very different news and media and we thought that that would be reflected in the types of ideas and stereotypes that that a liberal versus conservative held and yet\n\nI'm Louis ... only what these headlines the suspect in a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue forty six year old Robert Bowers faces twenty nine
