are you doing today show up Hi Jason Smith Tommy Caldwell basketball John Dickey the pro rock climbing pro free use of the really the greatest brave to keep paying travel the world and climbed the hardest in most exotic\nIn two thousand north base sponsored the for them to climb in the mountains of\nPurchased on the scale famous yellow [noise]\nThis location in Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there so for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year so how do you mean they got a destination yes\nThe climbers we're used to massive peaks and dangerous clear faces but still as their helicopter descended into the care to valley and the yellow wall came into view they were blown away probably what\nImpact of this none of us that we weren't ready for with me the scale of the Himalayas just how much bigger than mountains Arlen everything we have over here at first it was a little bit difficult to wrap our heads around\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if you didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nAnd ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle\nI was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute\nAnd I think that's probably one John's frame of mind starting to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from the area and he was patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padded among the switch shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our characters in us completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause and we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and um to try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they praying they mind their own business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge for a really bad guy elected himself president for\nLife and they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time there was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nExplained that John but we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss was going to get on the phone call\nGo to this other place and then his boss was getting get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then when we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to skate by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned the job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and um my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember back in myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as is evil and you might think even though we have seen them murder somebody I very much saw them as victims of circumstance in some ways I specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired\nMercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nJason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice\nIt's very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to make for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throat so am I going to jump on this guy and just by just throw his teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker raw and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nUm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain one of their captors ... split on now is only two characters with guns to foreign climbers they walked and walked for a whole night and the message for a day and then did again and they did this for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time [noise] um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was\nAnd you start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again and then finally one of his\nBroken asks what time it was when we take guesses and it turns out than five minutes\nAnd I I think that's probably one Tommy changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering on your teeth were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long they did have a few things going for them\nJust felt unbelievably long they did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it does hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guns Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of started as weird where we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come in me to [noise]\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and obviously a myth that he has bombed the story that I spent a week selling to us and bought a hook line and sinker [noise]\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and back then to not [noise] a shirt pleading with him not to go\nIn danger is out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was had to tear himself away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him enough ago he he has this look of like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up dual tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew led to up the mountain now it was four to one [noise]\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode there is just as ...\nGoing to explode there was just this ball and excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy has got to guns and a hand grenade a knife and you remove like all of that and you leave flight one down kid with a gun\nWith four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate they basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on this sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night and so John and I'm immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that they was game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up that\nMountain together and I'm always trying to find [noise] uh\nI'm trying to always kind of direct to away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nAnd you could tell that they were there like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with Beth and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it\nAnd she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything to them than believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive [noise]\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and were racing up the class and it just\nSort of scrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all and but as I\nJim and she wasn't expecting it at all and but as I was reaching out to grab his guns drop the sense what was going to happen\nAnd he turned towards me up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping a poll as hard as I could and you just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of wanting to sparks through them in like an eternity looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact the whole way down\nAnd so he had the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and\nHis whole body let us really horrible uh cracking sound because really loud and then he tumbled off of the darkness and\nI sat down and I just started falling um [noise]\nAnd then Beth [noise] showed up you know right after that and she sort of sat behind me\nI like that I can unjust zone out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to really like look ahead cranks revolving\nJust felt like one two one two something like that you gotta you know you had that sense of joy and you're just like find out it\nAnd it's been too was always happy and healthy\nUntil one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old since you started getting headaches to theory terrible headache and he was diagnosed with a now formation in his brain\nI mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain Mel promotions\nBecause here's what's crazy Spencer ... ... email formation had nothing to do with one another but spenders brain to Jewish and didn't seem like it needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would resolve\nThis was about the time when it's been two became very adamant with one request I can remember driving home from one of the appointments and\n... I can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery no matter what\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the NATO rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his and but\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to end how strongly did you feel this way I Would say it's about ... about eight and do you remember what you might have been scared of\nAh does not spread coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is when I was scared of\nA different person [noise] Spencer was scared his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes people experience\nLots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous like there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture\nFor the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him spent he was worried that if you changed his brand new changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything was them all met are familiar made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery is a connection\n\nRisky surgery instant connection changer even if they help you know\nThere was a conversation I had with him at some point [noise]\nOoh expressing from my regrets about my own surgery is because I still\nHave symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every day\nTime\nMinute compare it to him or one of my biggest regrets with the surgeries in in my surgery as the sun it's made me a [noise] somewhat better person at times\n[noise] um\nAnd I get a little philosophical with you there's like ... okay [noise] um so in like Julie ... story with Amy I'm been forced to\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so and I'm Wondering if that's intended by our brain or something less physical and I wonder what your thoughts are\nMy only problem in mind the intersection of all of those things somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly even play the physical to their ... it's been too having severe headache again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I and Spencer was just talking about or J. British and shortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that\nShortly after we arrived she began thrashing around I was at that sort of as bad holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restart is I read and there for a few minutes as I watched and try to\nCatch his ... I I I thought we witness and\nIt was really hard when I first comment from Los Angeles and got to spend ... hospital room in the ICU [noise] to see them [noise] in a coma in\nA condition than I hoped only I Would have to have dealt with and\nI Wish I could have been union\n[noise]\n\n\nGoing to take a short break and when we return we'll Spencers family as they make the decision that you know family should ever have to make snap judgment the override episode continue to stay [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThey just snap judgment on K you in our public radio Michelle Rivera with you this evening and look at the forecast clear skies mid to upper thirties Carson in season bill near forty overnight tonight in Reno funny tomorrow with a high\nNear Seventy for Reno in season bill in sixty eight for the state capital [noise] overnight clear skies alone you're thirty one for Truckee thirty\nOvernight clear skies with alone you're thirty one for Truckee thirty seven for incline village and twenty nine for South Lake Tahoe tomorrow thanks guys with Mitt upper sixties tonight clear skies\nOver elbow and when America with a low around thirty one tomorrow sunny Anaheim you're Seventy one clear tonight at mammoth lakes with the low around twenty three degrees and sunny tomorrow and the high near fifty seven and for bishop an overnight low near forty and clear tomorrow sunny the Jaime\nOr Seventy four to green [noise]\nSnap judgment is supported by target presenting future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie and Catherine ... cats are found\n\nWho must be studios will come back to snap judgment override episode when it was in Washington\nAnd we left off young men Spencer he lay unconscious some hospital 'cause all the Mel formation in his brain and all that his family knew was that no matter what he never ever wanted to have brain surgery\nSpencer and had a stroke and while he lay in the hospital bed sedated his family his mom and dad Steven as British do had to decide what to do is simply they had to decide whether or not to operate\nThey're surgeons name was Dr Keim and Dr Kim told them that if they did not operate now they were the one to five percent chance it's been two would have another stroke and that chance would increase every year of his life but the surgery he was proposing\nWas very risky when Dr Kim would explaining\nHe was posing with a theory risky without the came with explaining very daunting odds any recording yeah you could go back and listen to what he said over and over\nAt some risk associated with it about\nFive to ten percent chance of major complications from surgery or mine or ... or anything in between um\nI Know that my surgery before this half [noise]\nI think that the situation is dramatic changes and knowing that we know now with all that you know what you want to do and I think that's the position of putting your guys in is to make that\nDetermination nobody in the world knows better than review\nUm so it's not what you want or what I Want to write or when mom or dad did\nHave you ever performed another surgery with a difficulty but cut I heard of a brand new naturally yes that was in that deep Kevin ...\nSort of come up so I Know that there's risk but it's not a theoretical risks are real risk getting if it\nHappened all those particular surgeries which are drawn to that area what was the outcome will go to ...\nPercent of them five to ten percent of them will have a bad outcome\nOne that they wish they hadn't done the operations\nAnd you'll go crazy trying to convince yourself that you can figure out if he's going to have a ... and you can just keep going around in circles wondering like well\nYeah I think it's important that it's an intellectual decision but it's also an intuitive one I think the best decisions of life you have to feel good about it not just in your rationalizing and so forth off the air\nBut not just in your in rationalizing and so forth also you're Scott and listen to your gut instinct", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "19"}
