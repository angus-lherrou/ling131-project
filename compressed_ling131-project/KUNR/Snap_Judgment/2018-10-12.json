possible side effects of a frightening [noise] on that region rent [noise] and how he might not turn out nearly the same afterwards it was very risky\nThey all turned the questions over and over in their heads for twenty four hours the truth is that they were faced with the small but very scary possibility that Spencer could die without the surgery so like most people do when faced with the options they opted for life with at risk that that life would be depreciated they opted\nFor potentially worse off life over the fear of no life at all and that Thursday they watch this and to wield off to a brain surgery\nThey pay the holes in the hospital they bought rounds of coffee in the cafeteria just\nLiterally watch this analogue clock on the wall kind of ... through the minutes and\nOnly go to the cafeteria and playing the piano ... for gas and that calmed me down a little bit classical uses those things out of the time\nYou know finally Dr Kim uh came through the double doors into

piece in my school for no reason no how many weeks like ... three weeks\nSomething like that and there's like a picture of me in the hospital has made a tape my brand of my head as you said you know just all and like I Can't I honestly can't remember like anything before my whole\nSurgery so this was his worst fear supposedly becoming a new person but ironically it doesn't matter because he doesn't remember that old person who feel that um\nI I Can't it's like I woke up in a new wife so different person you know it's like two separate lives\nYou gotta pay with you is that okay with me yeah\nI mean it\nDoesn't matter if it does or does it like that is what it is I there's been times when I haven't been okay with it but but I get worked up and it's like why am I getting worked up or something I can do to change it so I've learned for it to be okay and I'm totally okay with it now but maybe like a year ago I wouldn't have been okay with it\nIt doesn't get hearing aids I think you
