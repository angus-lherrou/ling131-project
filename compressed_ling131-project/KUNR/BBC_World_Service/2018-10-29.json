I don't always have to\nFull or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if they have to say that they want to show in the video and then I have to take that into consideration\nOkay now can eat as much to me somehow either from page to final put up like what are your technique\nSo you know they gave me the fall I go back I could listen to a song and meeting yesterday snatch is of pictures in my head like I Do see like still frames and I just have to read those things together\nAnd sometimes it takes me a long time I got to you know please don't when I'm brushing my team got a point when I'm cooking when I'm speaking from why\nBecause the thing I'm trying to the way from is thinking about the idea is never watch for me I don't think about the idea and then she\nWould come to me in ways and you know when I'm seeking and that's why we have looked at when I'm speaking with a pen I just get up and I write it all down but then I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I tried to make it as a visual as possible in words\nI Try to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I signed up to them and a hundred percent of the hundred the article I Love that idea\n[laughter] really a hundred percent I I don't know I didn't I didn't believe I I I Do have to say that's that's what it is I Am very choosy and thinking about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point to the level of trust that has come in in in my career based on\nPresident of course it gets to a point I was like OK me say this is what we need to do I trust that this is what we need to do I because I'm equate deposit I'm the business press in\nSecond to last me quit to Boston but we're not pitching while cutting an idea very passionate about it I can see I can taste it I can feel it I Do everything from but when you look the dress you're going to win the props usually the entire\nVision is once you just have to show up in your boxes\n[laughter] you know let me let me I'm ... I'm\n... talks about repeat to listening so this film over and over again she's brushing my teeth when she's drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that vision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore [laughter] oh [laughter]\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't ... it ... you know you almost like gas yeah you don't even Hitler acts anymore you just feel it [noise]\nIt's good to just sit with that you know if you count the problem is sometimes you get a track and I like to get as a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday\nSometimes you get a truck and I like when you get the treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so that's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market will maybe I'm just not as popular with director Comey but\nYou know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors [noise]\nSo that's a little trickier because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many hours\nI recently pitched on the cot is a ... and Jay Z and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and I knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in a busy schedule I'm not sure they had time to talk to Cuba so [laughter]\nSo I just had to come up with an idea and like what's the best you know I didn't quite nail at that time but that's the part of being a director is that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success rate for sure\nBut maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... it can potentially be more competitive out that because I Know there's a lot of directors out there\nIs the biggest skill you if you're fishing for me on the energy the margin [laughter] that's a that's a larger scale I mean the odds you need to walk him of course with some amazing art is but then I think I'm lucky by the time to come to me that kind of meet up their mind but then again it's not genes look beyond\nYou listening to the conversation my guess will to what we need music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you've been operating at a level where many of the odyssey worked with a huge big names and know exactly what they want\nTo think can be specific examples where you have to navigate\nSpecific examples where you have to navigate accommodating to holding on to create a vision and under him you said you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points for somebody one can be a little bit differently so it just it does make you\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't this way because I mean I have to put myself in a specially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course jumps going to lead because it is a male dominated field and then at the end it cross all starting off\nOn television so I was the printing person that now want it to to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was every time you get the opportunity\nYou have to knock it out the park the first ever project that I did one official project and I did music video was a music video for an award ceremony\nAt I was one of the house\nAnd they had a a song that was going to be the theme song on and they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know I Do not like you know I'm a direct analogy but yeah I mean this is what we want you to start when you come out of state and things like that and I mean I'm not just from\nOne thing I had one day I had a dream about the concept to try to be a visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know who's running the show\nAnd he called me like it was like actually love this treatment and bite off your and like that's the I call that one and I need to make a decision on to them I said you know what how 'bout you do this\nHow about you don't pay me\nGave me that's what I Need to execute this project and you get a better job because of course you're going to have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute them\nGet a better job because of course you're gonna have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point that caught that chalk eventually to position myself I wasn't heritage that I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten a lot more boosted tuition but that is the only project I've ever had to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business card to you know a lot of people call me the New England but I'm a girl so [laughter] because it's just the music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nOkay can we talk about how much you're charging [laughter] I'm very expensive very kinds of honey you're not going to be holding Jesse fan you don't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging a fence it depends on the project\nThat things I charge denied that things are charging dollar a dip ... their partners like I'll give you figured that projects do that I Do for\nNothing at all that what has lead me the most money when you came to me my budget was a little bit too much for them I really love the project I wanted to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in\nAnd that particular project might not have\nLightened my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the most money down the line because people have seen that and gone I needed to work in this project\nRight for them with their figures are going to be given to me I mean you can get\n... now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much she or challenging and it's funny because actually my family has not increased [laughter]\nBecause they're the rule of thumb that older actors get temp set of budget is what would be typical budget I mean can you give me an example of the budget are we to reevaluate pan hundred thousand us donors are we talking about ten thousand US dollars\nI'm Out of hand hundred thousand us donors are we talking about ten thousand US dollars\nIt can be that it can be either um let's say a low budget project is around ten thousand oh and that means that direct to get a thousand dollars but that would be like a month what\nSorry you would get more working at a supermarket [laughter] because it's a matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and literally just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can you end up with a little bit of caution you pocket\nWhen you see the dynamics tempest and what does that mean I tend to sign of the total budget so who gets the budget well normally the\nBudget comes from the label\nCan in your experience how a male and female all its history to different the pie they record labels\nWell in my experience and is obviously general conversation and doesn't apply to everybody of what we thought it really depends on the artist and like how much they already have to bring to the table\nBut if it's somebody who has to be young and like a little bit lost and not really shore and that super talented and have an amazing voice and maybe the songwriting needs a little bit of collaboration with all the riders so it it it you know that's when the label get really involved and I've noticed that it definitely happens a lot more women than men\nInformation at Nevada fund dot org ...\nThere is eighty eight point seven in Ninety One point seven KU when our Reno and Ninety One point five K. and see the outcome\n[noise]\nIt's six o'clock in

agency owns have reached the area where officials believe the plane had crashed into those waters off the coast of cut out long ah which is not too far away from Indonesia's capital city Jakarta where the plane originally took off from\nWhat to be such an rescue agency which is responsible for these sorts of operations\nIn Indonesia what they've been able to say is currently they believe they found debris from the aircraft as well as possessions that they believe belonged to those on board but at this point they still haven't found any survivors they both are sent helicopters to scour the seas\nIn the nearby areas to look for any people\nAnd charisma I understand that the crew had asked to return to base shortly before the crash are the rescue officials or any officials in Indonesia reading anything into this as to the cause of the crash well China\nWhat they do say that they can confound the cause of the crash until they find the flight data recording of obviously that's also

the airplane\nBut he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plane looked like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of\nLevel balance from the point that it took off now\nThose reports that you were talking about the pilot had\nAsked to turn around soon after takeoff\nThat's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though\nIs that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will reveal more information about why this happened encouragement give us an idea what do we know about lying air and their safety records\nWell lion air is Indonesia's biggest budget and line it's the airline that you would typically take to travel from one part of the archipelago\nTo the other it has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy safety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia a few years ago covering the crash of ally an air flight\nWhich crashed in Bali luckily for everybody on board miraculously in fact there were no casualties from that particular incident but\nThe safety record of this airline has certainly been spotty to say the least over the last several years however aviation analyst have also said to me that lion has taken safety most seriously over the last few

partially a vote for ... above anything else they vote of rejection towards the workers' party and he was the candidate stepped in body the most and in the most efficient manner does rejection towards the workers' party\nThere are also many concerns that some people have for example he expressed admiration for the dictatorship his comments against the L. D. V. T. Q. community and he made racist comments about slave descendants what is his presidency going to mean with all of these comments and concerns that people have\nOkay I think that all those concerns are valid these world polling remarks\nProbably from an individual who never thought that he wanted to reach where he did a I Believe that the Brazilian institutions and the president political environment is strong enough to avoid and to prevent that ideas like this\nAre transformed into public policy and I'll do these remarks are are terrible\nI Believe that hardly they can represent anything practical in terms of a presidency because of the strengths of their president legislative and judiciary system\n[noise] now those who voted for him but his vote against the workers' party justify that a single really want a better economy from Brazil and he's our best option for that well\nHe gained a lot of strength and supports particularly with the president market when he chose

it by those tourists and some which\nFlights over the sea from other countries I spoke to ... vice presidents at the Seychelles who's at the conference with the announcement was made this morning\nLast year we generally think Seventy two thousand tons of waste and setting percent don't this is plastic waste so you will appreciate the manager of the problem we consume plastic but we do

as harming the environment is pushing tourists away something so many people depend on for their livelihoods\nBut they're not pushing tourists away but they have the potential pushing pushing tourists
