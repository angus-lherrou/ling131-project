best man album kind of blue and he was one of the original African American icons of cool\nThe term that I'll be ... with my guests on this for him from the BBC well service on the origins meaning of coup I'm Bridget Kendall the\nIdea of who has been the most allies in music poetry and praised fashion and films the why does find its way into many different languages it's something that millions of people across the world is spot you and today it's practically a commodity a way to help sell products\nBut what exactly is who and why did it come from some even argue that it's impossible to define\nThough I suspect that my three guests today will try to convince you otherwise joining me from the United states is Joel dinner scene a cultural historian a chilling University in New Orleans and the author of the origins of cruel in postwar America\nIn Massachusetts is Claudia Springer professor of English in film studies at frowning and State University who rate James Dean trying to get the many faces of rebel iconography\nAnd we'd be in the studio is the writer and Theresa Carol ... professor the Chelsea College of arts in London who started the concept of cruel and her two thousand and sixteen book the boss of cruel style narratives of the African die\nThat's a cool style narratives of the African diaspora welcome to all three of you and just start with I went to us each year in time if you could just pick one example of who or watch is the perfect example of cool for you personally and why do\nWell I don't like to choose an epitome of cool because of the concept changes every generation a little bit but since it started out as a set of strategies to defy racism I Will choose Muhammad Ali the heavyweight boxer\nAnd Ali although universally admired now a mostly white Americans hated Ali when he took them do some name and trash talk as a boxer so he grew up watching musicians which was Miles Davis but he knew that cool had to change into something more confrontational\nAnd so she didn't fight in the Vietnam War and he went to prison for three years at the prime of his career forfeiting probably ten million dollars and earnings\nAnd he famously said about Vietnam I'm not going to fight white people sending black people to fight yellow people to protect the country they stole from the red people so he was an activist even though Americans thought he was in fact sort of not keeping his place as an African American\nClose yeah what about you\nI'm going to name two people prince and David Bali epitomize cool they had called styles and they made cool music they were somewhat mysterious and unknowable and they continue to define cool even after that deaths in twenty six team\nWhat about you [noise] I'm gonna reference to people family holiday and Mrs Gloria banned from Duncan string south Yorkshire and the reason why I've chosen to women\nAnd then he terms of his um style there was a way that he dressed and made use of Ivy League style\nAnd this man I'm Chuck it and yes small jacket and tie and things like that he would buy clothes from\nShops on university campuses in the United states whether it's bound with play citizen I'm an open colds amusing of miles and he's on the front cover there is no graphics [noise] so it's very unusual but Nineteen fifty five [noise]\nHe's a nine um since the jacket beautiful pastel colored fight club for cap and no shit underneath the jacket [noise] there's no smiling he's talking directly into the camera and\nFor me he's saying I'm black that far I Am dealing with it\nHe's playing with this time he's saying this is a sort of preppy style or young white men you choose expense of universities but on dressing like this is\nKind of claiming it for himself ex athletes not just for one group it can be for me I'm like why wasn't\nThis emphasis on style on the on the looking good visual pose what we're talking about public tickets hat but more generally in sexual terms because he said something about your family you know how this relates to use so when they\nHow this relates to use so when they came over from Jamaica\nTo England in the Nineteen fifties they where we still British colonial subjects posed was important to them [noise]\nTo stress this idea of visibility that sense of pride making a life for themselves and Britain despite all in spite of\nThe racism to pull up our system that was rising in Britain the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties so there was this continuous actually feel like you have to present yourself the best way that you could but it was on their own terms in terms of how they wanted the will to see them\nSo up to this point we defined coolest largely an African American concept something that was to try to adjust musicians as a result of being on the outside not belonging being the other but well John's was at the height of its popularity the idea of coup was manifesting itself in other ways like for example on the silver screen\nSummer Nineteen forty one ... one time is now [noise]\nHauling gin joints and all the towns and all of them were\nShe walks in a mine [noise]\nHumphrey Bogart as Rick plane on duty Wilson asylum in Casablanca from Nineteen forty two directed by Michael countries including this was a new type of coup which ... the concept\nIncluding this was a new type of crude which ... the concept the Hollywood movie audience with the new ... what was known as filmed wall how does filmed while relate to who\nWell film water protagonists are disillusioned I'm cynical loners who often get embroiled in criminal activities this type of terse on ruffled male character was influenced by a hard boiled detective fiction [noise]\nIn the shadow when water world the male protagonists just out of step with mainstream culture and he's looking for alternatives he's a new kind of hero because he chooses to opt out and exist on the margins of society he's a world weary and and alienated\nAnd why don't you think there's this idea these heroes these coups here is so resonated with the audience\nI think on the surface ah America was celebrating its victory over fascism in World War two there was an economic boom happening in this country following the war I'm On the surface there was a real sense of optimism and hope for the future\nSo for film the wire to ah refused that to reject optimism was a resounding way of saying no to official culture and it did appeal to anybody who felt marginalized so in cinema\nUh there were many films that glorify the United states that were very cheerful and optimistic but film in the war was not this was a John or that was steeped in gloom and cynicism and disillusionment\nI'm Joel you said that the cooler peeled if this film law is linked to the post war popularity in front of ... century\nTo the post war popularity in front of ... says like oh but ... there's only ... can you briefly explain why in a way that is a wonderful historical\nConcurrence\nOr Albert ... who writes a book called the rebel a study of men and revolt in Nineteen fifty one\nAnd it is the first history or study of individual rebellion in the history of western philosophy and my favorite distillation in that book that is related to cool\nIs he says that I rebel therefore we exist and what he meant by that is if you're a rebellion is meaningful it must create the conditions for other people to rebel so Lester Young rebels and where's the shades and a slang and it encourages all these other jazz musicians to do it\nAnd the same is true with someone like Humphrey Bogart or Robert mentioned they establish a new way of masculine sort of toughness and acting and that provides a new model for fighting society fighting more dominant self congratulatory as a ... said Americans sort of patriotism\nAnd so it is not an accident that historically all of this happens at the same time there is an overwhelming need for a new definition of what a dignity for an individual person means in a global culture when the question is how do you matter\n[noise] we've been talking about China to be talking about film we've been talking about this philosophical approach to cool that seems to much concurrently for different reasons and in different sections of society in different countries [noise] the thing that strikes me is that ... of who seem to be men wearing the women\nThe icons of coups seemed to be men where are the women can't women be cool to Cairo\nYes they can I mentioned earlier Billie Holiday as um my example of the epitome of cool Billie Holiday was a jazz artists a jazz singer and she has to be seen as a female ... so this idea of where a woman\nInvasive maternity an expresses that in all aspects of their lives and uses clues and the way they style themselves to help the articulation of my identity and what that means for them\n[noise] okay so that's a a female coup like Conan tries to do what about in film to ah [noise]\nAh in film and why are women were often cooler than men and women refuse a docile and subservient role they pursue their own desires often ruthlessly\nUm they can be interpreted as part of the backlash against women who went to work and traditionally male factory jobs such as welding during World War two\nThe film the water from fatalities depicted as dangerous evil is a doctor is seen mostly in dark shadows at night\n[noise] okay so what do you think about this idea that maybe the ... one of the icons of coups seem to be mostly men\nIf you're talking about jazz musicians or feel more actors this notion of being sort of a rebel loner\nThat tough and stoic and stylish and brave and your art and style this was not really associated with women for quite awhile first time I saw a woman referred to his cool in a headline or as a description of her\nIt was cool and a headline or is the description of her personality and charisma was actually a Kim Gordon who is a basis from the ban sonic youth from the eighties or in the nineties and\nSince twenty Thirteen I see it applied regularly to the women who are merged in the seventies and rock and roll Patti Smith\nDeborah Harry Chrissie Hi and and uh so I'm just saying that of course there've always been women but the term cool has never really been associated them until recently the newest rebel persona I specially in music for example are all women and so to some extent\nIf that concept is going to continue to be a vital concept it's going to have to be defined and read directed by women\nWell in a minute we will be taking a closer look at how cool developed and how that rebels spirit was taken out and buy later generations that's in part to this forum from the BBC well service straight off to the news

I'm doren I'm Virginia ... in rebel without a cause from Nineteen fifty five directed by Nicholas re according to this is a film that speak for an entire generation of young Americans as you said but there's also point you know that these with the new teenagers very much opposed wool phenomenon\nYes in fact the word teenager was relatively new at the time or to some extent it was a luxury to be a teenager at a time when the economy was doing quite well and a young people\nBe a teenager at a time when the economy was doing quite well and a young people didn't have to go to work and become just like their parents at a young age so they had a leisure time for perhaps the first time in American history and uh they were also board\nUm this was a time of white flight from the city is after World War two people moved to the suburbs um and there wasn't much to do their so you've had this phenomenon of adolescence I'm at a loss for how to spend their time having the luxury of\nRebellious attitude not wanting to be like their parents because they didn't have to\nCount all the style that these films the fashion came to be seen as cruel to didn't as well as the ...\nOf course yes and it gave license to teenagers across the world to make use of everyday objects to say something new something different about what it meant to be a teenager so the classic of course the T shirt to white T shirt this everyday object which started um [noise]\nAs part of a naval uniform and around Nineteen sir teen was seen on the body of Marlon Brando in streetcar named desire than warmed by James Dean and rebel without a cause this\nDreaming white T shirt under red jacket so some things so ordinary coupled with a a pair of jeans could say some things so radical\nOne of the other major secrets from his parents we mustn't forget to and voted that rebels spirit was the thing I Elvis Presley\n\n\nSo what did Elvis fits into this pantheon of cool well Elvis fits in in both directions first of all Elvis worshiped Marlon Brando and James Dean are actually in the movie could Creole plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away\nAnd when he first ran to Marlon Brando at the commissary on the studio lot he shook his hand and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando\nSo that Elvis was a fan boy from Marlon Brando is kind of a shock looking back\nBut the second thing is coming out of African American music Elvis basically gave white Americans permission to love African American music because he was white\nHe grew up in the deep south he grew up with the rhythm and blues and gospel music and it is important to remember that Elvis's first hits were also heads on the black charts on the rhythm and blues charts he was doing something somewhat a rich you know with\nThe African American rhythm and blues tradition and so although he was often sort of seen as an appropriate or and you could say he is or is not but a lot of his African American peers at the time also enjoyed his singing and his take on NASCAR contrition\nSo Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage and he is rockets and energetic he's in control of his performance but he knows what he's doing and he once said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical ...\nUh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do it the next time so we have this real knowledge of how pop works\nThe impact to people like James Dean and Elvis Presley and popular culture has of course being huge and it's transmitted is such an idea of cool across the clay but I Wonder what you will think Kobe really talking about American cultural imperialism here is that what cool is in the end Joe no\nIt sometimes is a certain way it's the power of American culture but\nTen years ago there was a poll thirty thousand people on line of global poll and among the questions were what is the coolest nationality and to my great surprise it was American\nAnd the second question was why and this is the important part for cool the answer was because of the coolest people live there and the people they named where I kinds we actually consider cool and so there's a real sort of unconscious\nOr understanding that cool is an essential concept in American culture and in self definition now I'm not by any means saying are apologizing that there is an American cultural imperialism about consumer products and about capitalism that is of course true\nBut I think that there's both and there's a cool that's attributed to capitalism and buying things that are associate with America and then there is that cool is a concept for self definition and rebel cool in America\nClose your what's your view of the American concept is cool inspired young people around the world this isn't punch because American music in Hollywood films permeate the globe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nGlobe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nBut cultural imperialism is not the whole story in fact there's a constant cross fertilization between cultures adolescence internationally creatively reinvent the rebel icon for their own purposes\nAnd for post colonial young people the rebels style could be used a signal their dissatisfaction with the failed promises of of independence from colonialism unemployment poverty racism corrupt governments and oppression persistent both in the former colonies and then the former colonial powers\nThere was a film that picked young post colonial rebels um the French Film la Han from Nineteen Ninety five directed by much it costs the vets\nIn which three young men from the ... the housing projects on the outskirts of Paris try to figure out how to respond to police violence to bear is of African descent ... of Arab descent and Vince is Jewish\nOne of their friends has been shot by police during a protest\nAnd they adopt a cool detached style to feel invincible to feel strong and they emulate what they've learned from pop culture but they discovered it doesn't protect them\nKind of what you think about this idea of cruise cultural imperialism\nFor me it's not just about the kind of talking down if you like but it was that what ... being thing is that making use of those references to create something new and to say something new about their own experiences in particular a particular geographical space\nI suppose that's what we've been tracking throughout this parade ground the way one style of cool is being taken by another generation and turned it into it soon\nCan buy another generation and turned it into it saying and as we've been hearing coup hasn't remained static concept\nJob today everyone wants to be cruel and we're so things on the premise that that cool but it seems to run counter to the original rebellious spiritual detachment from the mainstream conformity that we've been talking about so when's cool today there's\nConformity cool marketing cool and those rebel cool and the marketing cool is the kind that people promote products and make it seem like you're a rebel if you have one or you'll be popular any of those things and then there's the grass roots rebel cool in which\nPeople and laid out adolescence choose icons that they admire that are rebels that they in a sense vicariously live through or lead them to their own path\nSo I Would say in terms of marketing cool cool is a rebel sensibility for consumer culture and that's ironic right so you don't want to conform so you pretend you're a rebel even though you're conforming but for me the rebel cool part the part that still vitamin alive\nI Would define rebel cool simply to sway the cool is how we go she ate maternity in late adolescence to icons of popular culture between like the age of Seventeen and twenty five and we're looking for self definition and you will find yourself and I kind of cool that guides you there\nHello it's time for new state owned the b._b._c.

the Supreme Court's new is justice Brett Kavanaugh of that process was held up by a series of allegations of sexual assault against Mr Kaplan I\nThose accusations were fabricated by Democrats depress and said before he apologized to Mr cabinet for what he called the campaign of political and personal destruction against him\nNow we'll know much more now about Supreme Court justices of how they're appointed and how recently certainly at the appointments system has been intensely political does it have to be like this particularly at\nA time of increasing it seems political policies on ships well next guest will tell you it doesn't have to be that way but we've been talking with professor Jonathan Turley about the general reaction over in the U.S he's professor of public interest law at

the cabinet controversy\nIt did fire up Republican voters\nAnd so many people believe that the Senate very well could stay Republican there's no question this was a powerful political moment for both parties and I think the Trump is trying to keep that fire on a Republican voters until we hit the mid term election right\nWhen it comes to public perceptions\nOf the Supreme Court which is hugely important part of the constitution the American way of life the accusations that the Democrats have\nThe American way of life the accusations that the Democrats are being ... this whole house how well is that going to run to people remember the Republicans using it some policies on value is well not that long ago I think\nThis is really a scandal in the eye of the beholder\nFor people who believed

again so that's how we got stopped it but that was nine years ago and a lot of things have changed since then so that one of the reasons why I decided to joined a business fulltime was I found that that was a gap between what consumers were looking for as well as what the industry was providing\nA lot of people go for official treatments or skin care treatments edit them at all adjust or they will get a facial or relaxing one at a spa\nThere was hardly anything that was in between to offset really really intensive facial treatments where they could heal the skin treat any problems ...

I Do believe\nThat some of the Asian type and like these conglomerates that come from Japan or Korea they are largely male dominated\nBut in fact I'm looking at a small medium enterprises in Singapore that have grown over the last twenty Thirty years were very good reputation many of them I started by women\nAnd women that are about my mom's age which is like fifty five fifty eight years old so they happen in this line for the last Thirty years\nSo I guess being the beauty industry in Singapore we are a little bit fortunate in that way where I Believe that that is a good mix of apologies for women to to be an entrepreneur and to shine and do well as well\nThe second part on whether or not women um lowly paid and why is that the situation being an industry we do\nLeap eight and why is that the situation being an industry we do know what is the industry ... especially for the front line technicians who are the duty therapists all the front lines retail stuff because ... is no minimum wage\nBut I strongly believe it is the choice of entrepreneur or a business owner on how they wanted to structure their wages if you want your employees to be that crammed cram the best employees out there then you have to pay a little bit not just a little bit or you have to pay above\nThe average not just minimum wage above average and structure compensation system such that they know that they will be compensated for good luck not just in sales and service in technical expertise and we offer a career progression so they know that\nFor example I have got a girl with us as an ... assistant who now is running my entire career and relations operations team in the last five years she's been five years and that kind of progression would have been very very ... take on how much longer\nBecause the curia progression says one there's one where you don't I just want to ... in terms of the new business things like maternity leave and paternity leave which tend to be on the coast for women in your progressing within the curies how do you personally\nWith that I Would disagree with pulling statement that it's the choice of the entrepreneur to remove the barrios the lowly wages NBC because when I said earlier that you know I didn't enjoy running this business in those early days it's because I felt deeply uncomfortable with\nIt's because I felt deeply uncomfortable with paying another go like eight pounds in Iowa it made me feel weird to do that because it just didn't sit right with me thought this is where I disagree with the fact that it's the choice of the entrepreneur\nBeauty is not seen as a essential hole a therapeutic old health giving service right\nSo because the market right for\nBeauty is in finished treatment is low you can't pay higher wages because the economics of your business will not walk so using your nails done I'm too can full of a critic Niles\nFull I've seen a critic announces low sixteen pounds right now for sixteen pounds it takes about an hour so you're taking away the wage the other's heads the costs of goods the cost of products et cetera\nYou ... then pay a higher wage so when you were doing you'll ... full custody of balance sheet\nYou will like how much can I pushed the treatment to pay my team\nA fair wage and then a wall we charge fifty pounds were critics very expensive we have a salon in central London we use the best quality products I saw it on is hygiene Nick on looks nice and isn't generally nice environment to be and\nBut because of all of this we don't might must has a profit because I'm choosing to pay\nOn now technicians fairly there any reason I can make these choices because I've another business and other business prospects\nBecause I have another business and other business prospects in other ways to make money but for the average\nThat are Reno eighty eight point seven in Ninety One point seven K.

[laughter]\nI don't know where the topic will be clean no see which when it's lumping you see the ...\nAnd I'm like wow\nThis is a good idea this idea we just don't believe in the community we just sat there and you're like wow I bet it let me think about it so let's get the pie in yeah this is Chris and yeah\nSo what about the cartels by building these area waterways shelf though is moving into that territory in a big way ... experience in states is in Kibera comes into play it sounds like you've got an enemy the cartels yes are they trying to stop you\nWe're we the people I mean it just does maybe if I think one of them are criticizing now have you had any interaction with them yes I don't mean to me that they started cutting the pipes at Fox they started cutting you'll pipe yes so that was really terrible so what I did for some of them would really be oh not too could be a wife or their children\nTo be the ones that didn't want to you know a kiosk rouse them income that's why we're able to survive than these ideally I also went by there is uh\nThen there's a delay our so well by that is that some times that they found out what time we don't stand mostly on the weekends we don't do send water for that day they said the water there this is Kenny\nOld I've a he has a run in with the cartels but instead of ending up in a battle he finds a way to negotiate his way out of the problem\nWe sent for two shootings and they said for Penn\nSo you will to it's clean I my wife is clean cheaper and cheap compared to what they must be worried about your experience offense yeah so yeah so I I Will find a way to work with them were before the ... without to it on the impact of the system that's your what's your next [noise]\n\n\n\nListening to Kenny how his life story there is some makes me realize that he really is the key to this\nSolution here and we sell always in our program it's about the strong willed personalities you can make these solutions happen and you can just hear that Kenny knows his world he's street smart he's slump smart if you'd like he knows how to operate the yeah\nDon't want to paint shelf guy as a one man band you know Kennedy just up on his own doing this in Kibera\nIt's a large organization now that does lots of different things they've got that call school like I mentioned the health clinic football team is always and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife and for all that was that they do that very well rewarded he makes a salary of ...\nFor all that was that they do that very well rewarded he makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US dollars a year and his wife used to make the same I think is now a bit less still is a little money the ... yeah I put all of that just shelf go\nThey said the salaries in line with over ... of a similar size or if things being signed off by the bullets are paying for that you know quite significant amount of money ... they delivering at the moment\nWell they bring in a lot of money shelf though just wanted to million dollar prize from the Hilton foundation the hotels ... yet the guys behind the hotels\nAnd that will help with older the what the shelf that does not just the water but there are other projects to buy the only ones who are trying to solve this problem shelf that not the only game in town\nThere are lots of different people and organizations thinking about how to live a wolf to into slums and\nJust in Kibera a United the country they all said and I'm thinking one woman she's in Wonder Woman with ... she was said gladiator a few years back if you remember that yeah okay well she runs a foundation that are also dreading bull holes that pumping oil syrup right from the ... of Kibera\nBut that delivering it in Jerry cans on caught so they're just putting it up and passing it out so they got the ... the same way by different methods of delivery yeah exactly and the Kenyan authorities themselves doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation\nBut as several experts told me the cartels can still be involved with those processes may be the most will be held legally during the daytime but then illegally at night so it's a complicated picture ... a little different players involved as you said it's how does shelf co fits into that\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this ... whole system I actually be quite limited because at the amount of water or you can produce this\nI actually be quite limited because at the amount of water or you can produce this way and he said that ultimately the real solution was what with governments and private utility companies to convince them that you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure out in the stomach itself so\nThat means working with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes that Congress and people like short Cohen Kenya but more fleet of foot because you know fast doing things on the ground you know how it works\nYeah exactly and that is the whole point of shelf cut their grass roots organization led by keep errands for the parents\nThey don't want to hang around waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem themselves why did I leave you with a clip from my interview with Kenny when he talks about how all of those mental it's been but he said he had invisible Mentos\n... mountain that unlocks the Rosa Parks this is how he said they influenced the way he thought about trying to help\nPeople in Kibera these men and women who don't just sit down and watch when this was happening and what they did they organized people transform their own life they didn't sit down and which will help and now that's not the answer for that to be a year come together [noise] you know [laughter]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nThank you for that report and thank you well tax listeners for well listening we hope you can

the day off to Donald Trump's victory so I often have the Democrats learned anything in the past two years\nSo I asked him how the Democrats learned anything in the past two years\nBut no they haven't but that's not to say that they won't do really well this fall they may well sweep Congress this fall but if they do so it's because of what you know it's for the same reasons that that they always get rescued which is that the Republicans [laughter]\nScrewed up you know that there that you've got this guy in the oval office who is this unbelievable jerk who has a antagonize so many voters\nSo now the Democrats have not taken to heart any of the things that you and I\nTalked about so long ago two years ago now\nWhy not do you think because they don't want to you know they like being who they are and they can see it as well as I can that someone like say a Bernie Sanders figure is extremely popular and the public would really go for a a you know the kind of policies that someone like that would put in place but that's not what\nThey're interested in they just aren't interested in that they're interested in something else is a category mistake that's not who they are they also\nIn in some of that primary that they have gone for more left wing\nCandidates in certain places that you had always are in Nebraska as well as in places like New York state where you might expect that so are are they are they're shoots of a different policy already starting to rise up boys you know I was just I I'm Sorry I shouldn't\nI shouldn't be so glum and so negative because of course there are the examples that you just mentioned there's a guy running for governor in Florida who looks really good there's a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in I Believe in the Bronx in New York City she looks really good and these people there's and there's many other examples\nAnd these people make me hopeful there's always some good people and the Democratic party and there's even good people\nWho are making noise is like the running for president in twenty twenty Elizabeth\nWe were making noises like they're running for president in twenty twenty Elizabeth Warren is seems to be suggesting seems to be hinting at that I think she's the best thing in the world I'd love to see her run for president but are you saying that the party machine and actually\nThe ... yes and I'm thinking more about is probably unfair to um talk about the Democratic party because the organizations in this country are so diffuse [laughter] they aren't really even organizations\nBut I'm Talking here about the sort of pundit class in America that really sort of determines what nice liberal people think and that pundits class is how would I put this a doubling down on this sort of the philosophy of two thousand and sixteen intensifying their commitment to that philosophy and how would you describe that philosophy\nA it's a professional class plus various other groups women minorities\nYoung people that is you know the Democratic party and that's devoted to the Democratic party and that's you know all fine\nBut the important thing is what do you do about the white working class what do you do about this enormous group of voters that have slowly but surely over the decades\nMoved from the Democratic column into the Republican column and for many years the answer that the sort of pundit class in America would give is\nThat's not happening we don't need to worry about that and then all of a sudden in two thousand and sixteen it became undeniable that that was happening and so their answer now is to say there's nothing we can do about it what if they're going to win big as you suggest in the midterms what's wrong and if they get power back\nThat's the name of the game isn't it it's a short term thing is the problem Democrats often when because when the Republicans screw up and then the Republicans come back a couple of years later and and get them back this is the natural coming and going\nAnd get them back this is the natural coming and going of American politics but let me remind you of the way\nThe sort of political situation in this country used to be after the Nineteen thirties and that was at the Democratic party controlled Congress from the year Nineteen thirty up until the year Nineteen Ninety four was only two brief interruptions\nOr the Democratic party was overwhelmingly dominant in this country and the reason for that was because they were a party that was obviously and clearly identified with the interests of working people\nAnd that's not the case anymore and they you know they did the Democrats deliberately turn their back on that version of themselves\nBeginning in the seventies but sort of a coming into fruition and around Nineteen Ninety four and they turn their back on that version of themselves and they have never really recovered from it you posit at the end of your book the unthinkable to Democrats of President Trump getting reelected what would you give us Jones is at the moment\nNo remember I had all sorts of coffee out there that I I said if if he you know this is all off if he gets impeached or if he if it's if he messes up the economy with one of his dumb trade wars or if he gets in a real shooting war you know which he could easily do\nThan all bets are off but the way things are going right now I hate to say this as you have no doubt guessed I'm pretty far to the left I think Trump has a very good chance of being reelected in twenty twenty\nYou don't think the Democrats have a candidate of the slave who can talk to those votes as they need to get back into the fold they do there are Democrats out there who can do that the problem is that if the country stays on the track that it's on right now the economy running flat out the accelerator\nDown unemployment getting less and less and less if that continues I\nDon't know who can I remember the period of the Nineteen nineties when we had\nAnd I remember the period of the Nineteen nineties when you know we had the sort of boom economy of the Nineteen nineties and there was real wage growth for a couple of years and Bill Clinton became incredibly popular you know like sixty Seventy percent approval ratings and this was this was when he was in the middle\nIn the process of being impeached you know it was it was the most incredible thing and I can't help but think that if you get that kind of economic situation again almost doesn't matter what the other side does\nThe American also Thomas Frank on the prospects for the
