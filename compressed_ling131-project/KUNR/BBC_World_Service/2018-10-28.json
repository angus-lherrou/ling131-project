thank you very much James great research published last week suggested using a mother's voice on the smoke alarm could save more children's lives than the conventional high pitched sounds that we associate with those loans\nA team at the nationwide children's hospital in the U.S state of Ohio carries out of the study on one hundred and Seventy six children and they found that Arnie Hoff woke up to a noise like this on a conventional smoking them\n[noise] buzz about Ninety percent of children World Cup to voice alum sounding something like this white\nCop time to get back\nWakeup depending I suppose if it's your actual mother to continue to explain why this might be we tend to Daniel Glazer and neuroscientist base here in the u._k.\nYour weight or asleep you'll since organs all taking in information from the world all the time she will sound or smell taste your eyes even with your eyes closed a monitoring the world all the time\nAnd we have very sophisticated mechanisms from bus to direct our attention to things that are important and to filter out the things that don't and actually it's the filtering out that's more important than the direction because if we were alive to everything that was happening all the time we'd be overwhelmed and so\nThe question is why do children succeed to ignore things in their sleep\nBetter than adults and this is clearly true for any of us who've had young children alone or others you can take them to a disco practically let's say to a wedding with a pounding music\nAnd once they're asleep they stay asleep through and and the answer is that ... that developmental stage of childhood sleep is more important than knowing what's going on this if you compare us let's say two elephants baby elephants ... pretty much immediately able to walk around follow the\nCompare us let's say two elephants baby elephants a bone pretty much immediately able to walk around follow the HUD see the difference between safe in dangerous places a baby humans\nAre blown dependent so at the trade off we make us humans is with bowling unable to the cough drops elves and in that time with that early stage of development the first two years sleep is incredibly important because it's in sleep that we replay the experiences of the day\nStrength some of the connections that we've developed\nAnd lose the ones that on simple so the tradeoffs that we make as humans is to\nBuild children that basically ignore everything when they're sleeping because sleep is more important than working out what's going on and that's because we're born dependent on our parents to the Gulf dress or essence can fend for themselves pretty much from both humans comes\nNow the question of why your mother's voice is more important than any other is an interesting story also about humans from before the with tuning in to sounds that message to us and so the first few months of life we're exquisitely sensitive\nTo the whole range of environmental sounds that we encounter the kind of music that we hear the kinds of language that we hear a very very young ages changes our perception for the whole of our lives and so babies tune into them up as voices\nFrom the very young age and beyond the initial period\nThat's just the sound that his most salient that's most relevant to them so it's not surprising that this preliminary results is a small sample a study that's just been reported finds that a mother's voice is much more salient much more relevant to the sleeping life of a human child than an author tree along\nDaniel Glazer who's in euro scientists where we thought we would test a couple of human voices loans which we've had specially recorded on I guess I should try and Matthew what'd you make these alarms uh which would be more effective do

I Know you've talked about alternatives to Germany 'til you're blue in the face we do every time we mentioned Germany and a political context how about the greens\nWell that's right so we have on the one hand the right wing populists ... Germany on the other hand to the left of the spectrum you've got the greens both parties are doing pretty well the greens doing really well\nI'm not because we've had a ... whole summer in Germany that's played into lots of green concerns about climate change also the green policy has really credible leadership right now so the the the scene is very nice it\n... this is already passed the ... of our national pitcher in Germany at the big main big tent policies doing less well\nBecause the scientists changed under votes is really look at individual issues ...\nIt's changed under votes is really look at individual issues rather than loan to loyalties to a left wing or the right wing policies they ... they have become quite fickle and that's why these these two policies are both extremes of the spectrum of doing pretty well\nBut what we're also seeing really is that there's a lot of dissatisfaction with the with the main policies I'm not ... connected to migration because the two big sense left center right parties quaint devices on migration\nThe greens are very clear that very pro open borders as they report says the ISD the alternative for Germany are also very clear that essentially a gates migration so when it comes to migration votes has no well those two policies think about\nAnd then not migration issue also is representative of the whole world view ready so the issue of migration hasn't actually been mentioned much in the ... elections in the campaign over the last few weeks\nBut that does play into an idea ... how votes to see themselves ... votes and see themselves as how they would describe as open minded all\nInternational tolerance or however you want to say they were the green is votes as they think of themselves as traditional they they're nervous about change\nThey might tell you the Saudis not read just about migration is about whole world view on not wells view is something that the ice the on the greens talk very well on the both parties across the United states on those sorts of quite emotional quite subtle issues\nDamien McGinnis simple in many things we're going to go to minute for quick point teach Matthew and Chitra on on your view from where you are on these German elections which sound quite important Chitra\nWell for me just listening to you ... that it strikes me how similar dynamics on not just in Gemini by now the pun intended about this move away from the center\nBut in other parts of the intense about let's move away from the center they from the mainstream that benefits those progressive parties like the queen's as well as the time right anti immigrant anti and also that this is happening in the context of economic growth and lo and employment I find quite striking as well\nMatthew ... all the point Damien made about the Green Party advancing on the fact that in Germany people are actually connecting the hot summer to climate change it sounds like they're well ahead of us in the u._k. where all the debate is so dominated by Brexit that\nAre in politics is always been more central in job yeah this will be a new door and even for that green well ... well it was quiet and I think so because he's such a huge economy in such a big global ... that we can maybe see a little sliver of hope that you're listening to the b._b._c.

might have been intrigued by the fact that sex robots Brussels have popped up in some cities on this subject it's fair to say that science fiction films\nHaven't inspired optimism from the Nineteen

to the city is having use that word for a while to death\nSo robots are going profoundly to change our lives and all sorts of ways but how will they affect all sexual behavior\nChildren after the room

row boats but were afraid to ask a new book\nIs called toned on science sects and robots and she joins us in the studio welcome Kate morning are quite positive about sex robots aren't you\nWell it away I mean I think there is potential for technology to help us with relationships to help us with intimacy on to bring pleasure to people but whether or not comes in the form of the currents ... is another story was how the collar insects robots there's really no to any\nReading it we kind of have one in prototype that's jus to ship to customers anytime now I really and it's essentially a

we're going to dispel a few minutes in a moment what do you make of the concept Chitra very briefly ... before we go on\nWell I find that really striking that human beings can do all kinds of things with technology and this is why we put a at rice\nSex robots kind of feel ... and you know divorcing the sexual act entirely from feeling comes with risks or does it\nI I don't think it necessarily does we and we know that sex toys for example looking around for hundreds if not thousands of years the difference here is that the current form of the ... is a humanoid form that's that's the problem because it tends to be a very productive stereotype of female body\n[noise] and and that's the problem why are we talking just about the female body on robots for women on the sex robots for gay women\nKnow though are not yet there are not yet at the ... version of a sex or will it tends to be a straight men that are buying the robots that doesn't\nTension venturing because on most sex toys still does which suggests that the to the classic lead on would be a you know deal do based sex robots\nNotify you so essentially there's something else here and I think there's two streams what the two lines of developmental one is the sex toy like you say this is the things like Elizabeth I breeders for years and the other is the sex all the sex still has always been a fairly nice market for manned\nOkay entitlement and some men in in sexual\nOK entitlement and some men in in sexual to ... you know this is an area that brings huge alarm bells um\nThe compliance ever willing female figure

fight on the air is as well and of course which always the hinges on a dystopian plot where the the woman got to be a potato and uh the female robots or takes over it as a threat to the mountains I think there's a certain power levels is with real life than not fear\nUm but yes it is it's just this past the female form that we have and I I strongly I've kept me from the wife not because we have technology that could do wonderful things in terms of\nHelping relationships them in terms of bringing pleasure and it doesn't have to be in this form\nIt's open field for questions Matthew I'm kinda nervous the venture into this minefield will have to admit pool when I saw that this was going to be a topic of discussion it just before eight thirty in the morning but K I honestly don't shy away you know I've I've noted [laughter] and my mom has raised ...\nBecame one can you tell us how you got into this topic what drew you to this you know I wanted to address that question [laughter] I thought it was to route\nWell I mean it's a fascinating subject area um it came up by Randy from a sitting up in a pub after a conference will come to the system was talking with a group of colleagues

the whole point is whether we like or not we want to replicate our our genes ... [noise]\nYes I mean we've touched on this slightly already by one in ... I Want to explore more are we not worried about what six row boats would mean for human sexuality particularly given that as we mentioned already designed by men woman suspended straight men\nWhat are the implications for women especially when it comes to attitudes around agency consent and rights\nAnd and also linked to that is not perfect analogy but when you look at pornography there a particular racial stereotypes um that uh uh put forward and pornography as well\nAnd I'm just wondering about I guess the the race and gender implications of a move towards um sex robots I slept ... ideas state\nYeah that's right I think it's very problematic at the moment it's very much a a male a straight while I'm ...\nI'm a last word has for norm of time so the idea that people um are in relationships are straight on on monogamous and I'm featured gender in this case um it's it's a mom and a woman and it's it's a sex that doubles Venus of China [noise]\nUm I think that that sounded problem I think um we know that the ... the ... that we have today all tend to be in this um\nSalmon I type of sexual form and the old tends to be white as well um where they aren't where they're they're adults with a different skin color they are as you say they're kind of dissolves sized um this is probably my take on\nYou say they're kind of sized um this is problematic and and I think that we do have to really address stop and look at new ways of doing these\nAnd just to check up all we ask the technological stage of development where robots can really accurately imitate opposed ...\nNot stop the other problem we're very very bad at making human like robots\nWith so barrel amazed how sexy can they possibly be wow ... ... it's a kind of the nation I think it will stay incredibly nice for quite some time but we can can you know integrate virtual reality now these the I mean showing the technology is changing so quickly this also official intelligence as hyper realistic veal I mean\nThe ... or at least if I can talk to you convincing absolutely so they had these are not in the mood give you a bit [laughter] this robot\nThese robots have personalities that are being developed you can carry around a standalone app on your phone or tablets you can have a virtual girlfriend and your phone they're working on a a meal version as well apparently um so I think that's that's probably be more realistic and convincing human than any rowboat\nWhat's being reception and fuel bookcase oh sorry to a quick point we're going to\nSay just hearing you Kate makes me I'm wonder why people need but she'll go frames\nAnd weather is is this does it say something about but apparently he got boyfriends and girlfriends does that mean let's be honest it's not boyfriends at such good friends that were talking about and does this say something about masculinity I'm In an era\nThat you would rather have a vet she'll golf and who doesn't it's not a real human being\nWith her own ideas and thought\nBecause I Know John ...\nYeah I think that's there's probably about it and I think it still stem from sort of the ... the idea that women are the emotional gatekeepers those so we of course you know we are able to go out there in ...\nThat women are the emotional gatekeepers those so we of course you know we're able to go out there and and bomb socially but perhaps men have more problems without\nDabbling all sort of turned on south science sex on robots many thanks for coming on the program big thanks to August ...

... stop too much and you can then walk out I said this pot and appears to me that the devices on all the devices seized and from that translate it into something meaningful\n... is it a bit more serious or were you have the washing machine you take a few alive you're wearing a white covered everything of course it's completely ... everyone is incredibly attractive him up and then you've got like a computer that some of the list of ... to go to ... and then somebody presses a button and a big green light flashes saying is if if they moved it must be definitely like that I'm\nA sad thing now you know what ... some fortunate they just light of computer geeks and ... days but we ... that are trying the washing machine again and again with different cycles and try and get with a fire and\nTrying to find connects to the like why that the washing machine was on trying to find a wife from the device not and why\nAnd each time just looking at a day though it was still hold\nThe data itself comes out in binary full map on from there it's just a manual case of going through and physically ... patents\nWhat was the outcome of this investigation to run the washing machine\nSay we're April ... if I was ... and I was on site on not helped to show you that the the suspects was indeed involved in the ... and\nSo the suicide of this is the ... investigative computer science this is forensics in our children and what do I guess be quite typical of the many investigations and what you're going to vote\nYes a lot of the investigations are they called in a department as well as the animal is by devices say something unusual all I really tricky binary for ... they haven't seen before and they're looking for that ... such the guy who's three\n... they haven't seen before and they're looking for that ... such to a three and try and translate that into something that can ease\nGiven that much crime and digital crime scams especially a global and then they show what role can you as digital forensics expert it's playing hoping to get some ... some of these scams for instance\nThat can be really varied depending on the nature of the devices involved but usually if we've got a device say the victims device you can find quite a lot of information about the day so that was received\nFor example when people are on Facebook you can see a lot about the people have message she have a what they said\nIt might not be able to get it all back you can get really good indication of what happened and it's about making people aware that even if you haven't got a device it was sent

flapping their are beating Seventy times per second and this is to keep the robots in the air so the wings they produce lift forest that carries the robot\nNot only that we control the we motions of each wing individually and this serves for control of the robot and this is similar to what insects are doing and\nSex also modified doing motions so that they can steer their flight\nWell it's it's the actual mechanism for slapping the wedding\nWe have to use motors that's been we have to then transformed is a rotating motion into flapping by a transmission which is a small linkage mechanism\nAnd when I think a human made wings flapping machines and this is an awful thing to say but I'm infringing those old sepia tone to movies of the disastrous flowing contraptions before in

robot flies very similar to uh fly that's let's say a research ... application\nThe robot itself it's actually already usefully ... it can carry a camera system for example\nIt can send images to the operator and you can imagine tasks like observations are explorations of a difficult to reach places\nFor future we can scale these robots down and they will become even more efficient at the technology will improve who will be able to make these robots smaller and smaller than we would like to\nRobots down and they will become even more efficient as the technology will improve will be able to make these robots smaller and smaller than we would like to upgrade them not as a single unit but as a swarm if you have many of those robots for example you could think of applications like a
