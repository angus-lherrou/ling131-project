scientists of issued what's being hailed as the most comprehensive statement yet on the perils of rise in global temperatures the report from the into governmental panel on climate change which is a un buddy since the world is failing to hit the target it needs to the topic should come down and there's two important things to remember\nAction needed is urgent an unprecedented about to say the scientist it's also\nFeasible an affordable so warning on one hand and recommendations on the other but does it all going to happen to keep temperature rise a dumb will lead to change society spend vast amounts of money and get political agreement now you'll have your own opinion on how much that's likely to happen uh let's see a rich black who's director of the energy and climate intelligence unit\nHere in London think tank up Richard we'll get your analysis on the feasibility in a moment but first give us a quick roundup of what the report is saying we've been talking for ages about two degrees limiting the rise in temperature to two degrees then saying that isn't enough why and what needs to be done\nKnow so we need to go to the Paris so it was it two thousand since the last one so that for two associate's degree political soggy but emerging from that Congress was an agreement that governments would make it\nIt's sort of agree political soggy but emerging from that conference wasn't agreement that governments would make efforts to restrain a global woman to one point five Celsius so they commissioned this report from the into governmental panel on climate change\nOn really what scientists have been done doing in the meantime is to try and work out what the differences in in pots look like at one point five Celsius well I'll just to Celsius well that is some areas there are some quite striking difference she at one point five you had half as many people exposed to wall Cisco city\nYou have one third of the number of people exposed regulating extreme heat waves and the impacts on the nature of vox V. different for example you could vote for the kids could bicycle race at two Celsius whereas at one point five up to that if you present the divide so quite significant differences between the\nTwo what's interesting is they trying to emphasize the knowledge to suddenly the affordability but the feasibility of some of the solutions that all they really feasible having a look at it would not an expert on these things are really major changes to my lifestyle to the world's lifestyle what are they saying needs to be done\nWell that's right if you put it in context we've been using fossil fuels in an industrial context for\nAbout three hundred years and the prescriptions to try and reverse that says he is so messy the Oscar I'm essentially you need to bring carbon dioxide emissions down to zero by twenty fifty just that he is time I'm now you can't\nIn Michigan emissions down to zero absolutely in every sector of the economy can do it in ... we know how to do it and ... we know how to do it in ... we know how to do and he said we know how to do in most areas of industry for example it's tough and agriculture and\nMaybe impossible in aviation so you bring the emissions down as close to zero as\nPossible and then you have to do what's cool negative emissions where you actually suck carbon dioxide from the yeah and that can be done either through things like punching forests are older technologies that do this\nAnd that can be done either through things like punching forests are older technologies that do this so it is a massive change but in each of those areas is feasible technically the question is what is it feasible politically\nRight if they want to see it they will go and of course this kind of marvel movie this is not from

have pretty high confidence in those types of events and likewise cold temperatures the reduction in cold temperatures strings cold temperatures spells though does those are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought I'm assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes\nThat right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nOne event that will that be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which rules so much damage in ...\nIn the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which route so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back\nAt the well\nLive\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains a several ways in which climate change it exacerbates it the events but as the hurricane season started his motives were suggesting we were heading for something of a coma\nMe issue me a ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these storms tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into a new ... new event as it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event in debt usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got a new ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical and sub tropical ocean temperatures then you're likely to see more\nIm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... rage with scale full wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most precipitation overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've had from friday also which is as a great the likelihood of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strength of the event has been changed\nYeah so what we're doing a slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the normal asleep on Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the natural beauty and you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nWe basically are able to ...\nBooming so we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of past research by climate scientists\nAnd that pattern is in uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so there's warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warning and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initial education so that when we run these modified forecast with our climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nWell as changes that that had on the atmosphere temperature as well as an affair temperature changes that have a choice churn the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and believes that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a changing of the F F T we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned it's something that is actually included in the set up\nThese patents have geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak because the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes\nBecause the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann particularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there's a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming that region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier were seen storms turn into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic look potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic a causing even greater along they may has been implicated in many of the events that have ... to the past few months\nSea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most some of those and recovering more poorly each winter Julian Streever of the national snow and ice data center was recently in the Arctic between Alaska and Siberia seeing herself the continuing decline in Arctic ice\nOf the things when I was

enough to support many people out there doing their their field observations\nAnd also we were trying to deploy our booties and you know we couldn't find many flows that were very thick so we're putting out these buoys and I said maybe a meter sick and you're hoping that it will still survive\nAnd locations where we put some of our buoys out already went through about twenty centimeters of melt since we had deployed them which gets boring because of the ice gets too thin and the booze melt out then we lose our data\nInstruments poll numbers so she's directly related to the climate slash whether shoes off this program\nThe reason why we're so interested in the Arctic is that the Arctic is sort of our refrigerator of our planet right so it helps to keep our planet cooler than it

wonder whether sometimes you fear that you run the risk of feeding a somewhat ... voyeuristic tendency in in us to want to know about how to December ...\nThe tendency in in us to want to know about how to dismembered body what happens to a body as it was it a sort of inroads over time we were sort of intriguing where repelled but are you feeding a voyeurism in all of\n'em I it's definitely there there's no doubt that we all like a good murder mystery and if people are going to be scared by crime I draw the they were scared by true crimes done by a solution author fictional crime that makes things totally unbelievable\nSo in your view is important if you were talking about how a ... they can be dismembered you think it's important to get into detail how difficult it all and willing to because\nThere's so few people will ever become as a member and for the chances that what I'm doing is educating them is extremely slant but those people who reads forensic novels are probably more forensic clear aware than any any part of the public has ever been before\nAnd they can quickly smell like something that doesn't find rights\nSo when I have is a huge amounts of respect for the crime writers who actually go and research what is it really like so that what they're doing is they're respecting their readers to saying this is reality I Know it's just made the salt this is actually how it would be I don't respect to that\nYou've written a book which is full of extraordinary stories and you describe so many countless experiences you've had with death\nBut what you do ... do and I

hard once they're dying\nThe deaths Wilson's hard on them being that wasn't hard it was watching what they went through in the dying process\nSo whether that was painful whether it was protracted whether it was there was somewhere that they'd they'd never wanted to be um but when that came for both of them it was an absolute sense altered release for them and every body and being that they were a lot smaller than they weren't in life\nThey look very small very shrunken but they were going on there was something\nWas amiss before opening as world you do feel I mean again it's digging

know because something happens then something changed I was there I held his hands when he took his last breath in life and I felt there was nothing more than I could've done from as adults and that it was the most privileged place that I could ever have been\nAnd it was such a gentle process for him that he decided he had enough he stopped drinking he stopped eating he turned his face of the wall and he decided he was going to die\nAnd when he took that that last breath and and the rifle that you hear when they talk about that that frontal is pretty much the fluid that goes into the lungs that comes I was the last breath then I knew he'd gone and I had no trouble leaving my father's body but I Would never have left my father is still alive and in uh\nNever have left my father he was

to him from that now good morning Jeremy good morning\nCould this be the eurozone's next sulfur in debt crisis\nI think it will be at the last few weeks had been hopes here in Brussels particularly within the European Commission that Italy's government would be persuaded to back down on some of its spending proposals and tax cuts are not tell it hasn't been the case in the sense here is that\nAnd tax cuts are not however I haven't been the case in the sense here is that there are people that the commission can talk to in room for people like for example Giovanni tree of the finance minister but then the people pulling the strings and those pulling the strings to the leaders of the two parties in the ... the leg and the five Star Movement have their own plans on ... on the confrontation\nHolds the upper hand in a standoff to think I mean at the end of the day at ... nothing else housing and interior ministers is the guiding light to the guy is is is not going to back down and say\nI mean ultimately this this country it is in the hands of particularly Mr ... who now is the dominant figure in Italian politics he's the he's the interior minister but his leg up hockey has soared in the polls it's now much more popular even in the five Star Movement which was once billed as the\nThe the senior partner not coalition and he is determined to have a confrontation with the European institutions we just heard from ... to ... talk about the European Parliament elections next year Mr Mr solving is dramatizing the idea that he's standing up to Brussels\nOr we saw for example when that bridge collapsed in ... ... ... a few weeks ago Mr solving immediately blamed your for that Europe's failure to invest in Italian if a structure\nAnd I think that's the conclusion that people here who've come to the to the Italian government particularly insofar as it's driven by Mr solving is determined to take on Europe will be seen to take on Europe and that means a major bust up over this budget\nBut do you think that there's a lot of posturing here that in the end they'll just have a line that they'll have to do that I Know who could they really take this to the brink and an ... down to where it really affects the the markets that really affects a debt on over the years and\nWhen I think I think the the the best case the optimism scene from the European institutions perspective is that the markets will disappear\nSeen from the European institutions perspective is that the markets will disappear into government you've already talked about Italian public perceptions of low spread so the the the um it's a ...\nA rising over there was a Gemini and and at the same time you hear people like ... I mean I was astonished his thinking on your interview with him that he was saying for example you know just what's the difference between one hundred percent one hundred and thirty five percent and there's no risk ... free findings refinancing ... that this is not a government living in the realm of economic reality I'm afraid and\nAnd it doesn't seem like government you know especially listening to your interview just now leaving itself much room to back down if it is a ... added to that you have to include the but the fact that there is now there's competition within the government between the lake are now the dominant force on the five Star Movement which used to think of itself as a dominant force and so\nI I can see this becoming a set of competition between the two a governing coalition partners in Rome as to who can be tougher who can take on the markets you can take in Brussels more\nUm you know we've we've seen the language escalating we've seen ministers accusing Brussels market terrorism was one phrase used\nUm and and I think this this'll this'll points in the direction of um of of of the major showdown in which the Italian government actually embraces um penalties imposed from Brussels over its budget deficit has got macho politics isn't it absolutely does does\nCloud ... of the nation how we could have a point I mean France and Germany they've gotten away with overspending and and you know exceeding their public debt limits that sets out by the e y called it and he just do the same it is one rule for them in one rule Satan isn't it\nIt's not a turkey and reasonable point and I think the the there was some in the commission particularly miss miss the most ... the a commissioner responsible for economic and financial affairs who ...\nThe a commissioner responsible for economic and financial affairs who were willing to give it to the government to bits of breathing room on this they felt that if they could be escalate to this conflict they they would actually denied the Italian government the chance to\nSee ... this is disagreements with Brussels\nBut I I think the difference I suppose picking people here in Brussels all in in the commission would say is that when Germany and France overstepped that a budget rules they would lead by governments that seemed at least to understand the importance of those rules and we're willing to die that country's back onto a sensible path\nAnd then they look for example the Italian government budget proposals and the wildly unrealistic growth expectations and there's and say this is not a government we can do business with in the way that we could do business with for example the French and German governments at the time when they overstepped the debt deficit limit\nBut the European Union can't afford to ban obviously this is this is the ultimately the big problem frankly\nToo big to fail exactly and and I think this this also interact with of course the the ongoing debates about reforming the yours and where the the commission is treading a very fine line on the one hand you have\nA countries like Italy like but it was the other other countries in southern Europe or who's the violence in the weaker and who feel that there was no ... years and who have been pushing for greater burden sharing within two years and then on the other hand you have an old and European states or one of them is Germany but even more hard line on this is the so called new ... leaks of this new kind of\nA ... in Scandinavian states led by the Dutch who who are very skeptical about any further risk chairing within the years and and that's all going to come to a crunch in mid December to summit here in Brussels\nAnd that may well now take place against the backdrop of escalating a sort of tit for tat between\nPlace against the backdrop of escalating a tit for tat between Rome and Brussels which of course we'll make compromise about some it very difficult

makes if this appeal and what they say about the legal time limit for trials of this kind that's always going to affect\nUm how many trials abroad in the future\nThat have been thousands of complaints we understand but a lot of them are very difficult to follow up because\nIt's so difficult decades later to find the evidence that prosecutors need to really bring a solid case I mean it up to the vet a himself is believed to has destroyed evidence releasing to the case he was tried on and of course many of those involved and now very elderly\nAnd innocence adopted mother in fact confessed the

without central government providing a lead how much difference could not make\nWell it makes a long term difference but I'll tell ya I a lot of people in our country a feeling like the federal government is letting us down then not following the science and not following the law they are trying to roll everything back but frankly they're not that good at it\nAnd so I feel confident that the rules will stay in place but it's that long term signal that you want to send you know\nWe'll stay in place but it's a longer term signal that you want us and you know this isn't a short term problem\nThis is this is a a challenge where we have the solutions today which is why on mayors and governors and why the business sector is really motivated to act because in the absence of federal leadership we can still do a lot of things at those other levels and in the business sector\nBut it's that long term investment that we're not seeing\nOne of the things you talked about an hour jobs and it's been the arguments of the current president and his administration that actually jobs were on the line because of some of the decisions that were taken to get rid of coal and gas how do you argue against that\nWell you probably look at facts which this administration sometimes doesn't look that closely had you know the facts are that clean energy is winning in the marketplace that's where the job growth is it is not in the old fossil fuel sectors\nWe see clean energy taking off in the United states and it continues to move at a pace that's faster than we ever intended that

backwards\nClearly one of the the way that individuals can change their carbon footprint is the type of call they drive Americans love cause and it's an it's proved very difficult to how to get America change their habits\nWe had to actually regulate a to get our car companies to sell fuel efficient vehicles that Americans actually wanted to buy which is one of the reasons they were going

strategy and they've been doing well ever since mostly record breaking years they're they're adding jobs\nThey're selling cars that people want to buy and they're saving consumes money as a result if you want to revert to really expensive fuel efficient vehicles that doesn't save consumers anything at the pump\nAnd it also doesn't save lives by cleaning up our air pollution today in addressing the challenge of climate change for all of\nUs to go outside and large look at some of the the extreme weather America seems to be having to to do with more and more I mean is that having an impact do you think on the white people look at the climate\nI Believe that it is which is why people know what's happening but we haven't yet turned from talking about how bad climate is to make the change to talking about what what is a a a future that we all want to move towards\nWe have to think about this a little bit smarter and instead of focusing so much on the bad let's talk about the opportunities\nLet's talk about how many lives saved if we move towards cleaner cars let's talk about how when you don't burn coal you don't spill mercury into our atmosphere that's an or a toxin for kids\nLet's talk about the contagious diseases that are moving in a changing climate to places where we've never had them before the droughts with facing let's talk about the opportunities we have to lift every buddy up\nAnd moved to a future that's better for everyone\nI feel like we're fighting about nothing instead of grabbing the future in running towards it\nThis report would it make any
