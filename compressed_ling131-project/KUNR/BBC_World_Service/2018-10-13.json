I was the leader of the use insects and me\nAnd I was knowing the person who would got my position when ever would leave and he was very radical and I was really scared about him and it was really hard for me to leave my place to to leave all these influence allowing within\nYes and you've by studying you've collected well an extraordinary story which you've written in your book inside I asked the ... death threats as a result of writing this book\nYeah absolutely um that was a problem before cause I was in a position to the radicals in the FD but when I leave the party then I recognize that there is no\nSelf control to some members they uh they send me a message about the ...

addicts them all and you open the last ... party Congress and then he said that it should be a resolution\nAnd this revolution should stop at the streets\nHe might say that but he and his party is standing for election yes and I let him across it can if you vote for him surely that's democracy election\nYes but we are in Germany we have to experience from the ... that there are some positions apart you should never took an in Germany we have some that red lines what you call and say without ...\nLines what you can't say without being forbidden as a party and if you say you want to attack

a better life in a rich country\n... economic migration has been going on forever or and you can absolutely understand why people looking to leave places that are politically or there's a lot of

the Democratic Republic of Congo and I just well the world Health Organization\nNow says the outbreak is at a critical juncture juicy the\nIssues with security in the region the now spread of a launch a geographical area of cases of Ebola and also resistance from some members of the community to the health care workers that are going in the southern women there are a hundred and eighty warm cases and the hundred and Fifteen deaths from the disease\nAnd has been a little bit of an increasing the number of new cases being identified but he's been very difficult to reach get\nRudy definitive figures on what's going on because of the violence in the region is making it difficult to do the basics including testing\nDifficult to do the basics including testing people who have suspected cases to see if they actually do have a boat\nAnd the security situation is making it difficult to treat people as a lot of that\nWell it's it's hampering lots of things to San Francisco to getting to patients but it's also hampering the purchase of contact tracing so the way you stopping Ebola outbreak has you identify case and then you find every single person leave come into contact to and\nYou mentioned trying to do that anyway in a busy bustling city or a remote part of the countryside is difficult when this conflict happening at the same time it's almost impossible say it's a very difficult job\nTo the teams from the world Health Organization other agencies half of them and\nThey're also facing resistance from\nThe local population you frequently see this in both cases people\nNot wanting voter used to be taken away and very safe because they remain infection risks they want to have their usual rich realistic burial processors and say they're now in some cases if

about fifty or so patients who've been given but these are those experimental drugs to ... to ...\nGiven them but these are those experiments with drugs that were talked about but never really used in the last ... really being used on the front lines for the first one\nSo in the end we should be able to find out whether these drugs really do what\nWill have a lot more clinical information about whether or not they work it's worth pointing out as we always do the\nThe way that you're going to talk about an outbreak is voice don't get it from spreading from person to person and this is an interesting aside and will hopefully be incredibly useful for anybody who's called the disease which don't bring it spreading just the way you're going to talk on the butter outbreak\nThanks very much

lots of government sent delegations to scrutinize the report and and really put the sign says through a tough challenge to justify that numbers and their conclusions\nAnd say oh did official level loss of governments have been doing this report but that's very different from saying that they'll do anything about it we certainly know that Donald Trump is in the process of withdrawing America from the Paris Agreement which is the only international agreement to tackle climate change\nThe front runner in the presidential election in Brazil wants to do the same for Brazil and Australian Government is effectively Gossett ordered its climate\nInitiatives and action so I think we've got a situation where lots of governments around the world a signed up to the rhetoric of doing things about this and some of them off Britain is phasing out the burning of coal for example other countries of ... very ambitious\nTargets of their own but some of the biggest play is particularly America

T. that was in government for over a decade\nWhich has been broiled in a huge corruption scandal which is involved hundreds of politicians across the political spectrum but there's also jail some of the main PT leaders will say he's also talking at a time when Brazil or experiencing a really deep economic recession\nThose are experiencing a really deep economic recession so people are really hurting and the country is suffering from a giant crime wave to events crystallized his support before the election\nUm one was the disqualification of the Workers Party former president we see now sooner rather silver who has been jails corruption\nAnd then there was another thing that happened that drove up votes for both so now to he was attacked during the campaign he was stopped and so therefore he got his big sympathy vote and it meant he couldn't take part in any presidential campaigns and since she's a very blunt mind this was to his advantage\nHow can the leftist candidate from the workers parties went under her bed convince voters that they should vote for him for not know how that has a real challenge ahead of him he has to placate voters who are totally disenchanted with the workers' party\nThey have never apologized for the corrupt system of politics in Brazil they've backed the newest Ignacio Lula da Silva is a candidate all the way fighting for him to come out of jail and they never went through a process of self criticism so hot that\nHe has to impress millions of Brazilians the heat isn't limitless puppet so what do people that make ... rhetoric because that seems to be toned down a little history\nThe trend in his government which is likely we got to add another poll out saying that he will not a wind and the next round\nWon't when I see is the kind of thing that both scenario has been talking about the number one priority has been the relaxing of laws and rules with security forces alone\nCause and rules with security forces allowing them to shoot first ask questions seconds\nHe also talks about uh putting more thieves in jail he's likely to give us a pro business economy\nBut it would maybe be a bit of a pro Trump trend in his government he also is very anti China just like Trump he's promised for example to stock the Supreme Court sympathetic judges perhaps again taking Mr Trump's lead\nAnd he's very suspicious of politicians and so he's surrounded himself with former generals and serving general so we may have a very conservative government very much with an emphasis on law and order\nKansas Pitt could the world's largest democracy be in the midst of a meat to store yeah oh for the phone with us movie mogul hobby once the allegations of sexual misconduct inappropriate behavior shaken the Indian media and entertainment industries\nSchools of women have used social media to give their accounts of the sexual harassment they faced many have even chosen to name their alleged terraces including some high profile men and for the first time many organizations are taking action against the accused ... explains what's changed\nLogging on to Twitter and Facebook over the past few days has been hard every all the news stories posted by women about how someone misbehaved with then touch them inappropriately or even out tried sorted then\nAdding to the hundreds of the ... that have already been shed and the conversation continues off line too\nAnd the conversation continues or flying to a\nShort while ago a friend called her telling me she just seen that someone had posted a story about men we talked about the full we chatted with each other how we felt uncomfortable around him and I told her about how it eventually blocked him on my food\nIn a country which consistently ranks among the worst in the world to be a woman sexual harassment is rampant so none of the stories coming out of the past week surprised anyone here\nBut for the first time we're seeing so many women willing to name their alleged harasses even if they're high profile powerful men\nThe person who started it all was form a Bollywood act a tunnel street duck thought she recently chose to speak out again about the alleged ... she faced on a movie set ten years ago\nWhen I interviewed her a few days back she told me the incident caused has so much trauma that she left the movies\nShe says she filed a police complains back in two thousand and eight but nothing happened\nThe act to she's accused is a senior figure in the film industry he's denied the allegations and I said he's looking at legal options\nBut the fact that a woman was willing to take on an influential man seems to have a boat and others to share their own experiences we'd also just seen the Brett Kavanaugh and lazy forward story play out in the U.S\nSome of the accounts and in women have shed ... years even decades ago but the anger seems to be fresh\nAnd for the first time we've seen consequences\nAnd for the first time we've seen consequences\nA few journalists have been forced to resign and many news organizations have initiated inquiries against employees who have been named\nA major Bollywood studio has been to spend a comedy show has been dropped by video streaming platform a big bully Woodstock has refused to work with the director who's been accused of sexual harassment\nIndia's new that has killed on a buddy of food producers have both sent out strong statements urging companies to take action when necessary\nYet so far this storm seems to be largely limited to the media and entertainment industries\nWhich not only have more female employees than most other sectors in India but you're also known to have more outspoken women pretty much all the stories we've had in the past few days have come from women living in India cities because here there's more awareness and better access to platforms like social media\nTo follow the meat to stolen hasn't even touched small towns or really India\nBut as a glimmer of hope that even if only a small section of women is feeling empowered at least it's a start somehow feeling triumphant than men guilty of sexual harassment must be sending sleepless nights wondering when they might be called out\nOf course there's also a worry that in this plus no testimony let frenzy innocent men might also find themselves being publicly maligned even before they have a chance to defend themselves as a journalist covering the story\nSays as a journalist covering the story the last week history get so many memories over the years a silence code has been formed

so one thing is all these protections are against a changing global climate was presumably if they didn't have it\nSo it is that if you were to implement all those options that we analyzed and hopefully we could avoid dangerous levels of climate change we know if that were not to happen then for example be critics bagged reductions in yields yet other changes in diet of people that might make them an healthier\nAnd also it might be harder to really implement some of the adaptation measures like building I dance and all that that would be needed to protect yourself from the impact of climate change so if we go on on our trajectory what we protected might be an underestimate accident\nMarco spring been from the opposite Martin program on the future of food renewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming was looking for\nThe big weapon in the fight against global warming we're looking for any source of electrical power that doesn't put CEO to into the atmosphere and may grilling false making a quarter of world generational ready and moving to sued by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University's David Keith backs solar power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power\nSuggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he took me through his logic\nFundamentally is to do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and\nSome of the simplest ways to think about wind turbines think about every winter buys being independent from every other stuff you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power I went to the next and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent in the end\nThe atmosphere is one big heat edge and it's driven by power from the sun and that power is always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite the argument to most a\nA very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third if ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest is heat and the energy of evaporated water\nSo that direct consequences at that point three percent is almost irrelevant but it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere\nOf course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct\nJust a patient at the energy and the winds that matters that's hardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heat in momentum at that in turn can\nRedistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate consequences\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind farm might be all said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a wind farm so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because there's more solar energy coming through this because you don't give a cooling effect to the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil will motives that it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night wind turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nAnd especially at night when the atmosphere is quite stratified when you have warmer airline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to warm the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then the biggest effect is at night yes how much of an effect on me I can understand that too you know that could be a bit of a tweaking but that wouldn't be with publishing\nI mean the effects in the region where large wind farms are seem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degree centigrade or a little bit more something like that but\nDegrees centigrade or a little bit more something like that but the issue really is how to think about the benefits compared to the harm so wind turbines are immensely better than coal and we have to be carbon Massey Energy system this is all about choices we make as we did carbon eyes\nI suppose what I'm saying is one when I'm On a global scale I don't suppose has a big effect you modeling is for lunch numbers of wind farms\nYeah but one wind farm doesn't have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs that's not just true for wind power is true for any kind of interesting\nSo one wind turbine does a very infinitesimal amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduced as climate change over the whole next century over the whole world\nThat one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs is just slightly venting the benefits of wind farms or want to get out to all together\nDon't think he wipes it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution impacts\nAnd given the very long time scale of us have to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon when power but I think it's important that the community begin to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we do carbon eyes\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density as of winter brown and raise basically how much power you can get from a single square kilometer of land with wind turbines and\nPeople have suggested it's a very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts per square kilometer we've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you that location\nWe've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet and we get a number and it's more like a half a watch per square meter and that's you know a factor of\nBetween a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWill not see important because I Know that you were very interested in some of the power and I believe that the ... ... square me to you can get from solar power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more was per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only them often would care about but the point here is about how much land\nHumans have to dedicate to the energy system which will you have environmental and social impacts\nNothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be in a free burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transition we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power what have you and the big important are finding I think is that\nThe land footprint of solar is something like ten times smaller than the land footprint of win for the same generation and in addition wind has this climate impact and these

insects maintain that balance when apple and my colleague immediate ... ... from the leader such a high Sondra yoga\nMichael on a study was to understand how flies are able to maintain balance twelve line and then one thing we already knew about flies was that they have these specialized ... called ... and oh tears are basically the fly equivalent of your inner ear because they'd be alert system so they use them for balance\nAnd size can't fly if they don't have their health care so one thing you can do is actually removed the hulk cheers from a fly and they can still take off but once they're airborne they just lose complete control tumbled through the air and\nSo that's not new information the first time someone to do that experiment was Seventeen fourteen I think but what we didn't know what how the whole cheers actually work though what information where the whole cheers providing to the fly so in order to figure that out what I did was to record from the whole chair neurons\nAnd I found that the timing of single spikes with different when I recorded the hulk here near on in a position that stimulated straight flight versus when I recorded while the health care was in a position\nThat simulated a fly rotating so basically my data showed that five can tell the difference between stables light and rotation simply by paying attention to the timing of the spikes coming from their whole cheering her on\nA boat with targeting as well because they have that ability to kind of over at the same time the girl so\nQuick that of getting away yeah\nSo these center there more reflective so they're on the canals sensation that sort of how you feel as opposed to vision and the reason they use these are there more reflective behavior just because it's much faster than fish until it's kind of like they can immediately detect a rotation and correct it really quickly\nWhat's important about funding\nSo it's important for us because this research has shown away that complex aspects of an animal's environment can be broken down to the timing of a single spike so this is our brains initially\nComplex aspect of an adult environment can be broken down to the timing of a single spike so this is our brains initially represent information in the world the truth single spikes anything on there\nOn every side and experience you've ever had that can be broken down into the activity of these individual neurons and Pfizer no different just easier to study fly because they have a lot fewer in Iran than a human what [laughter]\nWhat will it mean for for humans this information\nWider than human neurons work exactly the same way\nSo it certainly helps us to understand how different organisms sensory systems work in order to understand our own\nBut there's also more immediate applications for this type of research that one example would be flight technology why is it had millions of years to evolve fast and efficient mechanisms for why so if we can figure out how they do it we can use some of the same techniques to build our own bio inspired technologies\n... yoga and now before we puzzle here at the news room ... mind to all of our main news at

report calls for the well to aim to keep rising label temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to come at a price\nIs the well on track to me or anything like that target festival\nOn to clarify that the report doesn't call for anything the report also is a question that the governments have to ask the IPC\nIn two thousand Fifteen in the Paris Agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warming to one point five and now this report\nClearly shows that there is a important difference between warming off one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into raising rich global warming can be limited to that level\nAnd so just to be clear is the well them try to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to rule is knock on track currently the pledges of the countries that they submitted under the Paris Agreement lead the to increasing emissions over time and to twenty thirty whereas in mission should be decreasing very very steeply or by twenty thirty\nSo paint a picture of Warsaw the consequences of temperature is rising\nIf the ... the consequences of temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of the year it is really important for example for coral reefs are two degrees of warming we don't see any scientific evidence that they will ever survive at one point five degrees of warming it is still possible that some of them survive\nAlso for four to ... ecosystems there is a really clear shift in the impact\nOn forests and other systems and finally also for humans the difference between one point five and to a degree of forming is about more than four hundred million people that are more affected by heat waves\nNot everybody but clearly people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that they're actually putting things into you know five flying is one of the most environmentally damaging DVDs one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that\nSaw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that to people especially at the so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable life how do you prove to them that there are real consequences for their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible uh Simon on American my nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in a life of deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to\n... it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly because you don't have all the hanging around at the airport which are often outside the city center is so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better ... they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design a world that is both lowering emissions and one in which people's living standards Ohio\nLewis is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and\nFive to ten some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cost nothing equate long term\nCleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increase to the next ... to ... prices seem that you can get another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people for a larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no losers what we can say is that\nThese losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate for these short term losses but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know\nIt's our time law office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of\nGarments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the fossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a harder time however we the appropriate policies of training we've\nAre emerging seventies all their high technology sectors that were saying it may be the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get these ...\nCases if I can just bring you back from a ... year he was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the terms mission was a massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement although I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work from the sustainable finance area we can say the\n... financial products or pension products have to be aligned with the one point five powers targets\nFinancial products old penchant for that has to be aligned with one point five Paris target for example I cannot eat that night and the parliament and against the pool for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians rumbled for they say look ahead and they mentioned the world that is climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how a manageable and how difficult that will be politically and say that my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not\nUsually yeah it's just want to us today is that when asking the question who is going to pay to\nFor this won't really should not see\nThis as a luxury something that we do now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one\nThis is reading an investment in a safer and sustainable growth and when asking the question we're going to\nPay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question what was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already we can observe them today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree of warming\nAnd ... to a degree of forming this is not in the far future this is um one point five at current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degree yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for that\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing managed so that they ... the poor of the impact of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare law where he wants to\nGet like it yeah I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do I guess made a lot has been done we have an outline countries we've been able to fit in Paris\nBeing done we have Ninety nine countries with renewable feeding tirade Seventy three countries with auctions fifty eight countries that are the ... other places to subsidize renewables and thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mitigation coming down significantly\nSo these is making it easier the reason to global carbon price for instances agrees no but do is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have\nTo realize that there's been um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing the renewable energy technologies which have traditionally been\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications and countries indication they're beginning to be competitive\nSo it's these investments ... it is changing and that's the only say it again we are doing and we have been doing it is not enough ah as they see reports is reminding us okay um but I Do think this point at he's made all the report about\nMaking sure that the most vulnerable or not heard is not just necessary for ethical reasons but he's also necessary for political reasons because only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nHer when we talk about culture's important but we remember the\nGlobal economy is not stuff that you can there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent or twenty so that's been down to zero by twenty fifty so over the period in the mix between two thousand uh Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's going\nBetween two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double Ninety truly and we'll be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will\nBe built regardless of whether we make the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next forty years they are trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nOr we designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing a to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast the now ... panel throughout the as an adult ... case head\nAnd you eat the gal will tell you a short break ... just to remind you let us know what you think of the program or any ideas the topics he likes to look into you can email us that the real story at BBC don't care to eat cake will treat me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have the podcast you can subscribe to just set for the real story and you'll ... cost ...\nOf the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has supported by carbon offering data protection solutions for businesses including automatic back up for servers and point protection liability and disaster recovery and data migration learned more at carbon I done\nMurray and data migration learned more carbon dot com and by Boston beer company ruins Samuel Adams Boston loggers since Nineteen eighty four with opposite from the ... farm in the book very a region of Germany Boston beer company Boston mass promoting responsible drinking\n\nGood morning you're listening to KU when our eighty eight point seven [noise]\nThank you for joining us for the b._b._c. World Service\n[noise]\nNuclear just cannot compete with renewables and what we need to do is is electrifying energy supply and make it a low carbon as quickly as possible and most efficient and cheapest way to do that is proven you those\nSo uncomfortable and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make could Mondays I PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more ... effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an him in a crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but I I mean\nDrew nation as well but I mean okay so you're saying they'd been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration but it needs to take this seriously\nOh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron ... talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is a fact of leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and they use the science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually used the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for weaker\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on the science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line and South Korea last week they have not disowned as it is something that the American government has signed up to\nHow but how do you decide rebate and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of lead\nThat from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states as shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states and cities some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives his reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheaper to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the points the facts are becoming separates it from the optics and this is a president who wants to project to very particular and each one that appeals to his electoral base and what she said oh with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIs he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including coal mining industries and we need to tackle that the so called just transition giving people other jobs he's\nPart of coming up the solution here but the the other thing is I I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record the storm surge associated with that is pick up because it's sea level rise and as a good chance that the warmer than average waters in the Gulf ... ...\nGood chance for the warmer than our fridge Walters and the goals were partly ... because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing costs to varying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has gone way this has been in the support for innovation low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to see her all at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know carbon energy technologies but Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas these idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the first world the very developed well let's see if we may\n... to ... that a growing I won't speak to treat the group that he's a professor of environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joins us today from Cairo joy to I Want to about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\nFast but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly seriously just described to some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it's it's\nHave a future but since then it's a\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda there's much more to talk about renewables but at the thing that made me just give you a small example\nIn the evidence but I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in help\nAnd so uh that itself could be a reason for taking action on a bus with you and doesn't this come back to the politics because in the cost Indian governments have argued that a country that's growing is simply not positive\nIt wasn't part of the industrialization prices that if you like caused the problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beat in Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five\nAt that time the developing countries are doing the knock must take action fist no it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action the problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it it's no longer a Bible\nBase the action so it it's no longer a viable argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to bypass\nThe mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the north tried to convince a pension funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or the investments to the south and I found a very good idea to shifting the problem is that great and\nSo I don't think developing countries should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels they should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you think for a country like India that demographic that this is more difficult or easier to push through as an idea [noise]\nThe problem with democracy is of course is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to decisions relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand\nI think that there's a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science and I really think that if he can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains\nAnd that's really going to lead to major challenges the mountains stock to melt the snow starts to them as in the mountains\nAnd so as a consequence if you just try to look at\nThe agricultural sector in India the postal sect in India they\nWere really suffer and this was a reason to take their views into account\nTry to read visit our\nThey use into account\nAnd try to read visit our energy storyline ... so there's a big reasons for India to make changes similarly big reasons for China to make changes do you think China may ultimately find it easier to make those changes because it's not\nDemocratic China's been\nGoing for a sort of both and strategy of growing all energy time said once but I think any kind of well run country any kind of country that has a government that cares about his population will in fact be pushed by that population if had population as well informed enough about the risks that are coming down the line and are very near
