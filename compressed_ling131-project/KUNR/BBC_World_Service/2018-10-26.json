Afghanistan just held its ... parliamentary elections since the Taliban regime was toppled in two thousand and one\nThe poll expires oily recovering problems of insecurity the dome the country in the years since dozens of security personnel were killed hundreds were wounded and in some areas voting simply didn't happen as the Taliban attempted to ... Afghans\nAway from polling stations nonetheless millions didn't turn out on results will be to\nNonetheless millions didn't turn out on results will be declared next month\nThe government of president Ashraf Ghani is likely to hail approach that says evidence of progress on the road to stability\nBut beyond the rhetoric want as reality look like the Taliban operates with impunity in ... the national security forces are short on numbers and morale corruption as well as the insurgency undermined the authority of the state\nWell my guess is president ... recently appointed national security advisor I'm do a lot more easy formally Afghanistan's ambassador in the U.S a technocrat with little previous security experience is the Afghan government really in a position to shape the future of the country\nWell I'm dilemma he joins me now on the line from Kabul welcome to talk to Steven good to be here\nWe speak of course after the parliamentary elections would you uh accent that the\nWay those elections works out with so many Afghans\nAre facing the possibility of going to the polls because of insecurity and lack of government control of key parts of your territory they Bruce Lee exposed ever thing that is currently wrong with Afghanistan and its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban are and there is precedents of attacks on polling stations the African people defied all of that and came out to vote I think that speaks for itself on what the Afghan people's verdict on democracy\nWhat the Afghan people's verdict on democracy is and what it is that they want in their life\nThis was the first election that was completely organized by the Afghan government and security provided by the Andy SF\nUh I think they did a tremendous thing a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election day in two thousand fourteen when we had foreign security assistance and the elections or had a lot of support from the international community ah we're much larger scale than we had this year\nLet's look at reality I I Do not mean to belittle the bravery of those three or ... million Afghans who didn't go to the polls in face of Taliban threats I Do not but let's let bravery for one second but he is the reality your own electoral commission\nSays that at least a quarter of polling stations across the country\nDidn't open because of security concerns we know the whole swaths of territory including Kandahar and the guys in the uh that was no voting because of security concerns of course that maybe some more voting next week we're not quite sure we know that your own in\nA transparent election foundation and the country found that the biometric systems were not working and many of the polling stations which were open\nAnd if one takes all of that the guy's a plus the dozens killed and more than a hundred wounded around polling stations one has to conclude\nThat off the Seventeen years\nIt off to Seventeen years off post Taliban governance the government than Afghanistan is still not delivering for its people\nI are issued a statement our people our security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voices in our policies it's true we haven't been able to deliver the kind of services that our soldiers in on the front line deserve they have not failed us\nBut I Want to make sure that we also do not failed and when it comes to policies in the genes that that protect their lives and their families\nYou know what I'm mindful of mindful of something that Hamid Karzai's former president said as he was leaving office it was something that deeply upset many people\nAre in the west in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives because he said this he said the ... so exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan have been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life\nAnd know gains because our country is not secure\nBecause our country is not secure he said that of NATO's operations and of course\nThe operations cost more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life\nEither from nighttime forces off from your own Afghan forces unfold waltz because this is all you can't win\nAgain um something that you have the luxury to say as Afghans we don't\nThis is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives and protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government\nUm they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show is to tell you and and your viewers that\nThis is not the Afghanistan that you only see it from the TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there is only so much news a space for one son and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is a transform country whether you look at it\nPhysically or you look at it socially I'm a ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country ah grew up in the war our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace\nAspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nOr to help us along the way they know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste yes we are at war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves\nIt's a war that we must end\nA and it takes a it it it takes more\nNow than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks to reason with support who are being helping and equipment and training our security right is to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe ... we don't have so much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions or a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand all them\nBut he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently so Eric friends formula that had the Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action how would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S ...\nIf the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military a privatized contract to enforce\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism or and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's Afghan\nEnvoys ... he had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know those talks were taking place at the time were you told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire wet well I'll\nTell you and I'll and I'll tell you I was calling because we knew that I don't think it'll take me a straight on said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reports\nGage the Taliban right now the New York times reports that sources saying quote\nFills that I had these meetings with uh the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly met them an Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government\nHeard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one can formation for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report adjust because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ambassador\nYou didn't know his name very exhausted from his trip you didn't get to be clear then you I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban\nAnd it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided\nThat far from this position in the past where the Afghan government always says we must own any political process with the Taliban now the Americans seem to be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nYou you cannot have one incident uh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are are in Maine in constant contact with our American partners that's not their policy and let me let\nAmerican partners that's not their policy and let me let let me

flying on a minute you you know the people who votes to leave it's you'll mess\nYou clear it up and clearly Theresa May hasn't got very much room for compromise given those are much mentioned
