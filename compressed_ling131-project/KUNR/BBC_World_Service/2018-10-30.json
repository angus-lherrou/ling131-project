younger voters are and they tend to to break Democrat but in this particular cycle that's accentuated I answer Democrats if these new voters do turn out and there are some signs that they're going to be more likely to turn out really does give a boost to the Democrats in a district like this is reaching out to voters from the wild campaign\nAnd the final days of his campaign will come down to

an independent polling and election consultant first cafe what issues does she think will help voters make up their minds\nBut I find the most fascinating thing\nIs that the polls suggesting that we have two completely different electorate so Republican elect read which is motivated now say they are motivated now by issues like immigration and the Democratic electorate which is focusing on much more traditional bread and butter issues like\nIn particular this year health care that means that\nIt's an election that is operating basically on two separate tracks\nAnd leave what difference might the pipe bombs and the outrage in Pittsburgh ... what difference might they make you think\nI I think there's a tone in the closing days of the campaign that can move some of the voters who are on the fence we saw that in the presidential campaign after the combing letter and other things are going on in the last week\nWhere people moved into Donald Trump's direction I think right now this is the kind of issue that ... to talk about the important as in terms is you know unfortunate but\nYou know there is a midterm election and if anything this is not the kind of discussion President Trump would want going into the final week of the midterm campaign people are very concerned about what's going on and this affects people's outlook towards the stage of the country\nAnd Lee has the

'cause there there there was a note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished\nI think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes\nFor key legislation you look at what Republicans are saying at worst they say well you know he's got some odd characters things that I Wish she didn't talk about so much or tweet about so much but the agenda I'm really solidly behind there's very few Republicans who are distancing themselves\nOr facing election right now or reelection from Donald Trump I mean they they are really you know stepping in line to his administration and his presidency\nWas gonna say if I may there is relatively little difference in polling data\nBetween people who identify as Republicans and people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump it's not as if from one group is any different from the other\nOn in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues from President Trump and while they may not have an opinion that matches his when an issue first emerges after\nA week or two they do in fact echo the Trump position so we've got Donald Trump effect is leading the party and reading those people who who voted for him two years ago on if I also can add something about that we've had shootings in the United states\nWe've had a lot of mass shootings over the years it does relatively little in the long run in terms of changing opinion about gun control about what to do about gun violence\nOn there's usually a short term effect but it it dissipates in in us surprisingly short amount of time a week\nFat but it it dissipates in in us surprisingly short amount of time a week or two so this coming ten days before the election it's sort of hard to see whether or not it's going to have any meaning to voters when they go to the polls on next Tuesday\nUncovered what about Republican women because there are lots of things about what this president is alleged to have done to women and the things he says about women which might outrage women even if they are loyal to the Republican Party\nI've spent a lot of time over the last few weeks looking at the relationship between gender and partisanship and how that affects opinion\nAnd what seems to be the case is that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ when it came to opinion about\nSupreme Court justice now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerge can be very distinctive is among those people who identify with neither party on independent women are very different from independent meant\nYeah and I would add to that uh is clearly more about party than it is about gender with the exception of that critical group of voters and the basis of both parties are pretty much lock stock and barrel behind their party's candidates that these these independent voters and especially independent women\nAnd independent women who may be in the living in the suburbs\nWho are the ones who are if there is a swing group that's probably the group of voters that does the euro in\nOrlando less finished by talking about the Democrats we report quite a lot about changes in the Democratic party a much more progressive voices the kind of establishment Clinton I it's really losing the influence how do you see that lead\nYou know [laughter] I think the roots\nThe influence how do you see badly\n[noise] well I you know [laughter] I think there were a couple of primaries that sort of got some headlines I'm not sure that we have\nAnything that's clear looking ahead to let's say twenty twenty at this point\nOther than there's a lot of mobilization among the Democratic party I don't think the Democrats at this early pick sides as to which part of them is going to dominate the process I think they're unified in their opposition to President Trump to this point ...\nIf the Democrats take control of the house of representatives um it's very likely that Nancy Pelosi will continue to be\nThe leader of the party in the house and she is certainly identified as one of the old guard on the other hand she's also a woman which is a distinction that may prove valuable in terms of her contest for house speaker if the Democrats taken Trump\nJust a short answer from each of you how much can use it for the Democrats will take the house or even the Senate late\n[noise] well I think you know the ... and I suspect cats will agree with you know I mean the conventional wisdom maybe right on I ... how is likely to those Democratic senators like does the Republican\nIs very likely that that national house vote is going to be clearly in favor of the Democrats but the way districts are drawn that may or may not result in a Democratic majority in the house of representatives the Democrats have a terrible time trying to reach a majority in the Senate\nJust because there are too many vulnerable red state Democrats who are on the ballot this year\nAnd and very few Republicans who feel that the that Hillary Clinton carried so the reverse doesn't hold its just because of all these Democrats are in states Trump Card\nIn golf director of the Marist College poll and caffeine in front of it and then the voting\nCollege poll and Kathy Frank
