she does this but it suggested that she's done it by snake bite and this this story really takes a whole so that pretty soon after her death it's accepted that this is how she killed herself\nThe snake makes a very appropriate death weapon for queen of Egypt because clean so very strongly associated with snakes an ISIS the ISIS is also associated with snakes so it seems very appropriate\nBut

well should we just leave how'd you rest quietly in the desert sands of Egypt I don't think we can leave that to us because they assume that\nI don't think we can leave that to rest because there's so much Cleopatra information's delight that people are still I'm slowly fascinated by huh\nI think what we need to do to keep looking and try and find the truth of the story because she's an inspiring

G\nA Donald Trump is willing to the U.S may increase its nuclear arsenal in one of the world's oldest intact shipwrecks complete with most brothers and rubbing benches has been found at the bottom of the black sea it's more than two and a thousand four hundred years old and it's incredibly well preserved\nOr we're going to be speaking to one of the marine archeologists who discovered untouched\nAnd I'm speaking to one of the marine archeologists who\nDiscovered it that's coming up we'll update to let's not for Julian ... thanks [noise]\n\nThat you're listening to us in the U.S as a possibility that he might to poke town to buy a mega millions lottery tickets to be with a chance of winning a record breaking one point six billion dollar check pulled but we'll see or to winning\n... I spoke to do to lose left in ... Georgia Tech school mathematics to find out why you would have to be very very lucky\nThe mega millions is a ... a lottery that crosses most of the United states there's about\nI think maybe four states that are not included so it's really almost like a a national lottery in the U.S where people buy a tickets or two dollars and they choose one special number out of twenty five and then five\nOther numbers out of Seventy and if they match all six numbers they'll win the jackpot is one point six billion and assuming no one else chooses the same number and the winners will get their share after taxes or a\n... I'm going to go out on a limb here in suggests that if I buy one ticket miles on winning up Chris Eli\nThat's correct in fact your odds of winning or I'm exactly one and three hundred and about one in three hundred and two million and that's true no matter what the jackpot sizes but\nWin the jackpot size gets large then more people buy because they they're just imagining themselves those billionaire so\nEven if my one in three hundred million show comes off that possibly others who will be sharing it with me 'cause most people have signed up for a ticket\nCorrect I Believe the the lottery commission has said that they expect Seventy five percent of all possible combinations to be purchased by tomorrow\nMission has said that they expect Seventy five percent of all possible combinations to be purchased by tomorrow so there is a pretty good chance that someone's going to win\nSo deals on me waiting a pretty light and all these 'cause I'm not in the U. S. but the old some someone winning considerably better\nI think it's pretty likely someone will win well or or possibly many people will when depending on how the how the numbers all\n... would it technically be possible to buy some many tickets that you would guarantee yourself a victory\nIn principle you could buy all possible combinations but in practice it's impossible there are\nThree hundred million combinations and the tickets cost two dollars each so if you had six hundred million dollars that's the first obstacle and then uh you wouldn't be may be willing to invest it in the lottery and win over a billion dollars\nBut the trick of course is you're not guaranteed that year will be the only winning tickets so you're jackpot might be cut in half instantly or even further if there's multiple winter\nAnd I spent on top of that the sheriff logistics of buying that many tickets I'm going to be easy\n... absolutely not or if you do a back of the envelope kind of calculation a you will find that\nEven if you have somebody filling out of all possible numbers in a certain range about one ticket every ten seconds you might have one person might be able to fill out about ten thousand tickets between now and win the lottery is drawn\nBut you need to fill up three hundred million so you're going to need to hire is thirty thousand people and let a tape that old gonna want to share with my ... greedy I Would imagine that they're all going to expect a share maybe they could do a little uh you know if you get the the winning tickets like a charming and the chocolate factory you might be the one who gets it\nIn ... I'm probably not going to win this love for him I\nI I Would say that's the safest bet I know and in fact I Would say that no one listening\nTo this program is likely to win the lottery\nIs that I Know and in fact I Would say that no one listening to this program is likely to win the lottery I Know the BBC has lots of listeners but I'm going to go out on a limb if you are listening to this program and you win the lottery called me up and prove beyond wrong\nYou know what call us up at print it right and that's going to stop and she had the money that's what I was thinking you know exactly because you know one point six billion dollars to get a little bit of rebellion thing he said in a little bit of repeal it's [laughter] not at my says she could've bought tickets so you know statistically he thinks there's no jobs but\nHe's not feelings on it by not later is maybe there is these days she was seven\n\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

I don't always have to\nFull or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if they have something to say that they want to show in the video and then I have to take that into consideration\nOkay Kenny I'd like to me somehow either from page to final put up to like what are your technique\nSo you know they give you the song I go back I could listen to a song and meeting yesterday snatch is of pictures in my head like I just see like still frames and then I just have to read those things together\nAnd sometimes it takes me a long time I got to you know please don't when I'm brushing my teams that played when I'm cooking when I'm drinking some why\nBecause the thing I'm trying to the way from is thinking about the idea is never watch for me I don't think about the idea initially\nWill come to me in ways and you know when I'm sleeping and that's why we have looked at when I'm speaking with a pen I just get up and I write it all down but then I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I try to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I found it to them\nUsual as possible in words and then I sent it to them and a hundred percent of the hundred the article I Love that idea\n[laughter] really a hundred percent I I don't know I didn't I didn't really I I Do have to think that that's what it is I shouldn't have picky about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point to the level of trust that has come in in in my career boosts all\nPresidents of course it gets to a point I was like okay this is what we need to do I trust that this is what we need to do I because I'm ... I'm a business person\nSecond to last me quit to plus plus it we're not pitching on something and I do you have very passionate about it I can see I can teach it I can feel it I Do everything from the when you look to dress you're going to win the props you actually the entire\nVision is what you just have to show up and you'll boxes\n[laughter] you know for me maybe you can get 'em\nKimmy talks about the ... of the film and over again she's brushing teeth and she's drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that season for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore [laughter] oh [laughter]\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening prices until you just can't you don't miss it ... you know you asked yeah you don't even have the lyrics anymore you just feel it [noise]\nIt's good to just sit with that you know if you count the problem is sometimes you get a track and I like to get us a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so\nLike can you get the treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so that's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market well maybe I'm just not as popular with director Comey but you know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors [noise]\nSo that's a little trickier because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many imaging hang ours\nI recently pitched on the cot is a B and say and Jay Z and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and\nI knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in a busy schedule I'm not sure they had time to talk to\nHer I just had to come up with an idea and like what's the best you know I didn't quite nail at that time but that's the part of being a director is that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success rate for sure\nBut maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... out of it can potentially be more competitive out that because I Know there's a lot of direct it out there\nIs the biggest skills you if you're fishing for me on the energy the margin [laughter] that's a that's a lot just tell me the opportunity to walk him of course with some amazing artist but then I think I'm lucky by the time to come to me that kind of meet up their mind but then again it's not genes look beyond\nYou listening to the conversation my guests to what we need music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you've been operating at a level where many of the artist you worked with a huge big names and know exactly what they want\nTo think Comey of specific examples where you have to navigate accommodating to St Louis\nWhen you have to navigate accommodating to holding on to create a vision and I knew him he said you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points when somebody when something a little bit differently so it just it does make you\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't this way 'cause I mean I have to put myself in especially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course drops going to matter because it is a male dominated field and then at the end it cross all starting off\nOn television so I was the put the person that now want it to to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was every time you get the opportunity\nYou have to knock it out the park the first ever project that I did want official project and I did music video was a music video for an award ceremony\nAt I was one of those\nAnd they had a a song that was going to be the theme song on and they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know what to do it is not like you know I'm directing out it's like yeah I mean this is what we want you to start when you come out of the stage and things like that and I mean I'm not just from\nOne thing I had one day I had a dream about the concept to try to be as visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know who's running the show\nAnd he called me like I was like actually love this treatment and bite off your like that or I call it that is one and I needed to make a decision on to them I said you know what how about you do this\nHow about you don't pay me\nGave me just what I Need to execute this project and you get a better job because of course you're going to have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point\nPay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point that got that Charles eventually to position myself and it was imperative that I knocked it off the part I might not have gotten long boosted tuition but that is the only project and I had to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver\nIt wasn't always like a business cards universe and a lot of people call me the New England mama girl so [laughter] because you just need a music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nLike I can we talk about how much you're charging [laughter] I'm very expensive very kind of holding Jesse failure you don't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging offend it depends on the project\nAnd things like ... and things are charging ...\nI'm ... ... they're probably like I'll give you figured that projects do that I Do for nothing at all that but I Believe me the most money when they came to me my budget was a little bit too much for them I really love the project I wanted to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in\nAnd that particular project might not have\nLightened my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the most money down the line because people have seen that and gone I needed to work in this project and I saw that somewhere\nIt's an effort is going to be given to me I mean you can get ...\nNow I mean I can you give me a sense of how much she or challenging\nAnd it's funny because actually my family has not increased [laughter] because at that as a rule of thumb that older actors get temp set of\nBudget is it what would be typical budget I mean can you give me an example of a budget which would allow you to ... hundred thousand US dollars and we took me about ten thousand us donors\nIt can be it can be either\nI was in us donors are we talking about ten thousand US dollars\nIt can be that it can be either um let's say a low budget project is around ten thousand and that means that direct to get a thousand dollars but that would be like a month's work ... you would get more working at a supermarket [laughter]\nBecause it's a matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and literally just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can end up with a little bit of caution you pocket\nWhen you see the dynamics tempest and what does that mean I tend to send the total budget so who gets the budget well normally the budget comes from the label\nIn your experience how a male and female artists treated differently by they record labels\nWell in my experience and is obviously general conversation and doesn't apply to everybody of what we thought it really depends on the artist and like how much they already have to bring to the table\nBut if it's somebody who used to be young and like a little bit lost and not really shore and that super talented and have an amazing voice and maybe the songwriting needs a little bit of collaboration with all the riders so it it it you know that's when the label get really involved and I've noticed that it definitely happens a lot more women than men\nComing up after Denise it's wild ... are we talking about people who can play tricks in our minds that they're not magician scientists and engineers amount we should let the the note sinister\nBond villains yeah these people during intend to take over the wild they do have some unusual conscious to manipulate our brains to try to solve some problems facing the wild right and why are we going to be hearing they sound [noise]\nIt's kind of a digital copy and somehow even if you're feeling anxious\nOr stressed out it can trick you into feeling much calmer or at least on the idea and\nWe're also talking about late this year yeah no it's scary that they found that actually

Parkinson's you and I can walk without cultures to be paying attention to it that automatic abilities lost and people with Parkinson's but you can actually literally trick the brain by bypassing that\nAutomatic pilot which is more or less to start engine of the brain by consciously recruiting the motor areas of the brain so what the lasers basically do is offer an external visual trigger\nForcing or allowing the patients do very consciously take a step forward and stepping over the laser beam\nAnd in doing so they ... they are defective automatic pointed\nRight okay I think I get that for people that have Parkinson's the will to my way of moving at and walking which we all take for granted if damaged so having this visual trigger helps the brain received those messages in a different way yeah another\nReally good way to think about it is generally Parkinson's patients don't have any issues ... says\nThat's because the status going up woods acts as a visual cue or obstruction by policies that defect to the ... the sensory illusion of the ladies as ... in the same way it tricks Brian by constantly placing a key\nAnd from out who as we had a bad idea has had

the unit and then I get to the capital and I can't stand up straight to ... the capital\nAnd I'm guessing from the capital to the sink and back again it's just a real asset it's really exhausting and then to have to go to get in the milk when I've forgotten to take it with me is all things we'll see what was his shoes on it's still hard what\nBut it makes it possible to do those things instead of almost impossible [noise]\n\nSounds like in these issues and then have\nPeace of mind yeah she told me broadly speaking she can now go to places like the supermarket with the knowledge that you can

they wouldn't no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that list of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offer discounts all but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they would no longer\nIn the United airlines told us they would no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual

that they are\nComplaining of financial woes in court documents about it's hard to know exactly what that it has but I think one interesting effects of that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the end are a spending in these twenty Eighteen mid term elections they're spending far less on candidates that we would have expected them to go all in for\nNot much does appear to be true recent filings in early October showed that the n._r._a. was spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth of its spending at the same stage of the twenty fourteen mid term elections\nWe did try exhaustively to speak to the n._r._a. for the ... business daily from the b._b._c.\nThey wouldn't make a spokesperson available we also failed to get any formal comment from most of those companies who withdrawal miss a pool for the n._r._a. but we did reach one candidate base for them that was caught up in all of these protests David led the stores the chief executive of mentoring equipment co-op\nIt's a retailer base in Vancouver the price of the Parkland shooting in February was stalking some products linked to a significant us weapons manufacturer vista outdoor group\nThere was a petition and to us than had some fifty thousand signatures on it but what we weren't really watching was the conversation on our our social media channels and they're missing twenty thousand conversations that were happening at the time and it was evident that there was a lot of\nEmotion um a lot of movement on this and we believe that we have to take\nAnd that there was a lot of emotion um a lot of movement on this and we believe that we have to take action based on what we're seeing and what we found him primarily in our social media channels\nSo what did you do precisely\nWe spoke to the vendors we reached out to industry partners and and rainy trying to get a feel for this before making a rash decision [noise] the the vendors that were impacted were long\nCanyon vendors off hours whose ethics were posted two hours and then ... the holding company so they were very round people um that we're supposed to be aligned to us that would have been impacted by our decisions\nRight so I mean essentially a with the prime move you made right was to to to stop selling on your shelves products made by this vista outdoor ... which\nWas you would not setting firearms or ammunition yourself this drought during does manufacture those things so you you basically cut them off as part of your offering to customers until they stopped manufacturing firearms and since then visceral outdoor I Believe has got rid of it so far on manufacturing business\nThey make up for sale I don't think it's been sold yet\nI'm just making the observation here we approached you but obviously we approached a very large number of U.S companies who found themselves caught up in this boycott of um of the n._r._a. or and gun products in the wake of the Parkland shooting you were the only one who agreed to take part does that surprise you\nProbably not because as I say that we looked at this ... this was a social decision for us not\nA political ideas ideological decision whereas I think in the U.S in his formal politicized\nDavid ... of NBC in Canada so how much have moved like this really hit the gun lobby at least in the pocket as mentioned the ... campaign spending has fooling\n... at least in the pocket as mentioned the ... campaign spending has fallen dramatically this year but professor Bob Spitzer doesn't think financial muscle is key to the un RAs influence anyway the key\nThing to the ... political influence really hasn't been money so much as it has been the cell is loyalty of its base\nGun owners and gun rights advocates who will attend a meeting vote based on the gun issue will make a phone call attended demonstration when most Americans stay home and two thousand Seventeen for example\nThe n._r._a. spent about five million dollars on political lobbying activities in the context of American politics it's really not very much at all\nTo the un arrays fine and swimming alone despite its claims of publicity\nWell and the ... does have money problems\nThey spent a whole lot of money in two thousand sixteen election cycle that gave thirty one million dollars to Donald Trump that contributed over fifty million dollars total money they really didn't have money that could have come from Russian sources that's the dark allegation reporting on in the American media in recent months\nAnd their difficulty is that their sources of funding or rather finite and there's a long term existential problem\nThat fewer and fewer Americans are interested in having guns the typical gun owner in America is an older white male and that generation is frankly dying off\nBack in the Nineteen sixties one household and to have at least one gun in it today it's under thirty percent of households and\nThere's an interesting phenomenon there even though fewer Americans own and have guns the average number of guns owned by gun owners has increased today the average gun owner owns more than eight\nSo let's hear from the rich and Mary Wilcox oh too long to gun owners they live in a rural area near Albany New York state where they've seen it\nSoon as they live in a rural area and the opening in New York state where they've seen a steady rise in local government restrictions on firearms and ammunition sales they learn how reporter killed at the county into the house to see some of the many weapons they keep\nThe first one is a three oh wait that would be for deer hunting bear New York state has quite a population of bears and are actually starting to get to be a problem because there's too many of them\nMight pistols there that's a forty caliber and this one here with my great grandfather's guns purchased in Eighteen Ninety it's more of a buffalo gun for shooting buys him\nHe's so excited when he comes home and the deer and it's really neat what we can have for dinner as a result of that it's just amazing\nAnd especially like venison with here it's very very low cholesterol\nBecause they're wild animals do not like a cow that's eating grass not doing anything all day long I in my lifetime member of the n._r._a. I've been a member of the an array for Thirty years they support you a hunting accident or somebody breaks into your house and you shoot them you know legal fees\nThey just had somebody just recently just shot somebody in their home in the area of a like a burglary yeah they broke somebody broke into their house and I literally carry my pistol all the time so and it's loaded for this reason for that reason security\nWhat that does is by me having the gun it gives me a choice if I Need to protect myself or my wife or my family I can do that\nAnd if you look at your biggest crime rates in cities are in cities that don't have guns\nLike Chicago has the highest murder rate in the country they have the toughest gun laws in the country\nTighter gun control it's like you guys for how'd you guys see that play out\nI think it's a waste I mean they're really chasing the wrong rabbit on this thing it's not a gun problem it's a mental health problem\nRabbit on this thing it's not a gun problem\nIt's a mental health problem education problem it's society's problem I mean when I was a kid people brought their guns to school you go to school to be guns and hanging in the back windows of the car or the trucks\nThat had shooting classes in school\nNobody got shot like they did okay nothing it's it's more of a mental health thing it's more of a societal thing than a gun problem so if you're going to they're going to outlaw guns and the only ones who are going to have guns are outlaws they're making criminals out of everyday people\nI mean I don't have a problem with regulating guns and controlling who has them but you can't\nYou can't just blame blatantly say no nobody can have them\n... because then you're going to end up with just bad guys having guns\nRich and Mary will coax from a town called water for the New York state well they may be a gosh there's all the new anti gun measures that they're seeing but this could just be the tip of the legislative iceberg at least according to care Linda fink progress\nThis is a critical midterm election this year and I think we have candidates running this year specifically on a platform of gotten safety and we have a candidate outside of choice I named Lucy McBath\nWhose son Jordan Davis was shot and killed and Florida number of years ago\nAnd this year after Parkland she decided you know what if I Want a candidate who's going to support the type of gun reform and said I Do it should just be me and she is now the only one way see candidates like this across the country I think the environment and the United states is different this year than what we've seen in\nPast having voters energizing galvanize over something like diamonds will help candidates at all levels I think we'll see facts all across the ... came ... one of course\nI think we'll see facts all across the ...\nCame all end up one of course going control is just one small issue affecting voters choices in the upcoming midterms in tomorrow's business daily we're going to be looking in more detail of what has been a record breaking year for us electoral fundraising what difference does all this money\n[noise]\n[noise] it's ten o'clock in London five in Washington May Day in Nairobi I'm Julie ... died from the BBC\nPresident ...
