violations of some of the very values that it's representative of so you know a slavery I'm a genocide\n'em long standing patterns of segregation and this is very much part of American history the question is how the country takes up those issues in the current moment does the\nYou have to reach out beyond your own groups whether it be women or whether it be African Americans you know to build a winning coalition you've got to go national and you've\nGot to obviously you include men and you've got to include a a range of of ethnicities\nSo how do you go about building booze coalitions that cooperation\nWell so I I guess I have to roll back for a moment and just to just that yeah as you mentioned your ...\nFor a moment and just in just that you know as you mentioned you're familiar with my writing in my writing the whole point\nOf intersection analogy is to talk about the kind of ... coalitions that are necessary in order to realize are\nA state of values and object is um there are many applications of intersection Eli across any number of differences and cross any number\nOf forms of discrimination one of the points that I made and the New York times article that I wrote two weeks ago was to say that the failure of a coalition between anti racist and feminist was one of the factors that led to the elevation of Clarence Thomas\nAh over in as against the ah claims that were made by Anita Hill\nI'm what I argue there was that there was a common history of anti racism and feminism found and the fact that the very term\nSexual harassment at the very knowledge meant that sexual harassment\nIs in fact discrimination was largely stepped forward by African American women plaintiffs who are experiencing discrimination when they when they were working there is a long history of African American women bringing gender into anti racism and bringing anti racism into feminine\nBut but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights company knew how to the history of ... as you say the failure of\nThe times of of ... feminist to make common cause with the black ... I'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting one who ... who says I find myself at the end of my into instructional feminist rude it's time to ... ...\nInto into sexual feminist rude it's time to ... back into survival mode due to the dumpster fire and live by a black feminist agenda\nAnd\nI mean if I could build its plenty of people who actually\nUh say the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group miss\nUm respond to moments like these by showing that there are a few individuals who are at things differently of course we don't all think alike\nAnd so having a quote from someone who um is exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of a white women is not surprising I'm often frustrated by it as well in fact\nI'm only forty eight percent\nActually believe Dr blazing Ford there's I'm far greater racial gap in American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean a gender isn't significant\nThat doesn't mean the patriarchy isn't working through it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time I know this glide is a problem I I\nGet I get the intersect the argument that you couldn't bring different groups of press people together to make common cold and that can make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to motives are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out at all to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be with us on a majority of white women voted for Donald Trump ... is there any way\nThe majority of white women voted for Donald Trump ... is there any way do you see that you can use your arguments new powers of persuasion to make inroads\nAmongst Lewis groups if we pull into groups\nOr many of us are I I think one of the\nChallenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side of the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was a\nMultiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nA ... that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the differences I think in fact uh the last a week opens up even more possibilities are\nEverything that we've been seeing suggest that many women\nAre particularly those that fifty three percent that in that in fact voted for Trump or may be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here\nHas always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency in the in the prison how do you feel about ... with the midterms coming up his regions of the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this ...\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class\nAbout Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and it'll GDP Americans that is a little known since I said I go vote from every demographic\nDo you see Obama or some body but you know Democrats need to listen to and be mindful of because he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect\nBronco bottom of actually walking rather killing off he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWell I think it's tough for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements or\n... on on a range of issues some of them having to do um with the the failure to actually even have a rhetoric um\nIdentifies some of the structures that continue to create any qualities um I had took issue with him for example on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but then excluded women and girls but that\nI'm sort of difference um within a broader reality\nWe are a country that\nShapes ourselves around certain values and I think he tried to perform that\nAnd it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of uh the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania\nI'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's a good reminder of the fact that this isn't an inevitable dimension of American politics and just a final vote on\nThis is an inevitable dimension of American politics\nAnd just the final thought on that as we go into elections that we're in an election season and the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition that is interesting isn't it when Ron Brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nA ... democratic votes as you said a clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the cultural liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale whites with\nThe often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino support says that again in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and ... group based politics is he's a very complex a complex set of relationships and attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I don't I make the complexity even greater I'm the most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women they're the ones that game the vote that the victory to Roy Moore a\nUS Senator who was the first Democrat to the elected from Alabama and a generation on their black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenges how can we not only use black women\nAs the wheels and the best but how do we actually put them in the driver's seat what are the agendas that actually speak to them if we can figure that\nWill probably be able to figure out how to speak across the working class 'cause black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition of winning political global mobilize\nA coalition that is what we're looking for in this in this midterm election we'll see\nMobilize a coalition and that's what we're looking for in this in the ... election

malicious operators and actors than there are now and there was many many many orders of magnitude less data and in particular data about you\nI mean we're getting to a social crisis over the uh very Internet that is generated so much economic growth in the last several decades\nBut still people don't necessarily panic about sold at someone else's harvesting that data and particularly if they're getting a free service and Rita and if it's a social platform or something else\nBut they may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely\nAnyone so what is the ... it was this architectural weakness\nYou're seeing people like Tim burners Lee served timber initially who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's spent many years now developing a much more decentralized Web it's fundamentally to\nHis Web it's fundamentally to put the control over the data about you that you generate in your hands period\nYou haven't got to own your data and if others want to get that data from you you may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants her government wants that\nWe're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential as Ken burners Lee has publicly not only develop these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it\nOr to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have is\nThe most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens like your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that Facebook Google and everyone else is using rather than opting out as it is now kind of ... being posted that's absolutely\nCorrect and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property negotiations all the time but I think\nIt's starting in medical data you know there's a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you relative to other humans\nBut right now you're in danger if you share your\nOh you're in danger if you share your data from a insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data because they're not afraid that there will be things that happen to them that are bad in their future so\nI think the European Union in some ways is further along than the United states but I I think the scale of the uh catastrophes that are happening on the net including the very attacks on the foundation of our democracy have open people up\nInternet pioneer and would be reform Larry small now you know human isn't just about identity theft and data harvesting there is another problem some reckon demonstrate to buy the emergence of so called information warfare fake news\nThat ... is the founder of scout AI it's a media company focused on the future of technology and she's been studying the way the boats and Emma nippy electing the way we talk and debate on social networks\nI've done a lot of analysis especially if Twitter date in the last year and what we found is that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so\nFor example the Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations around Robert Mueller that go on online I very very large percentage of those conversations are often driven by pots you know I did a quick search this morning and found you know one\nI did a quick search this morning and found you know one tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent bots but generally ...\nPercent of the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll machines\nYes yeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or division of comments on line is that\nThere is a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with the deliver intent to anger you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left and the idea is to divide those two groups of people further and harden and calcified their beliefs are that in order to change their behavior and specific ways\nIt's extraordinary isn't it I mean you just take a moment to think about what that means if you were to transform Twitter or Facebook these platforms into a physical community we'd be standing or in a crowd of people Seventy percent of which would be machines\nYou know it'd be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk like real people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or a belief about the world kind of like living in the Truman Show\n[laughter] it is sold in the living dead might be another movie but I I just people presumably don't understand that they still don't understand that I mean you and another political commentator that they were having a conversation on telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other at least they think\nYeah I mean when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people responded to these people or pots or algorithms whatever they might be\nYou see that they work right people responded to these people or pots or algorithms whatever they might be\nAnd they'll retreat them they'll use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them the way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire\nAnd the normal people get involved and it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on often on what's trending on Twitter or Facebook\nAnd those stories then become mainstream news right so that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially been architect did by a group of fake\nAccounts on social media\nAre usually the mainstream news meter was complicit in in that eventually as everyone else\nI Would love to see a major media company out there and take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that would be a very powerful statement to make as a media company but it has and you'll have not yet\nBuried under the new suggests a variety of ... to fixing these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like block trying to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nI think one of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with ... pretty pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into that and and get around that but the whole idea of watching is that every person has a node right and I know\nEvery person has a node right and I know drop a denser identity but all of those notes are connected in every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah I mean it would be in a decentralized the time because I'm trying to see\nCentralized but it's also you can delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did this interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is a potential future for one way in which because at least improve the architecture the social social platforms absolutely yeah are you optimistic so this is going to ... that we have a way through because ultimately we will go to live with the Internet is not going to go way we've gone on invented\nCan me I'm very optimistic I think we we live in a really interesting time for the Web where I think we've outgrown the architecture of the Internet but the good news is that people like Tim are coming along and really really care about and focused on how do we reinvest like what is it looked like to reinvent an Internet that's actually built to do\nWhat it does today there are a lot of people out there that are very passionate about doing that so yes I'm absolutely optimistic about it\nAn optimistic berets and dissident who like Larry small sees the beginnings of change but neither of them expected to happen quickly\nJust technology it's going to require major international country by country regulation of legal changes it's a bill of rights there's nothing more fundamental and it's going to take years if not\nAnd it's going to take years if not decades to move in that direction but the solutions are beginning to be on the horizon\nInternet pioneer Larry small I guess we should stress that this is just one vision a point of view that he's putting forward that will be many no doubt from Internet firms and elsewhere who disagree with the design fools he's describing\nBut whatever side you settle the debate about the future of the net is vulnerabilities is clearly a key part of the public conversation now\nWhether the Internet changes or not then expect coals for an Internet three point

sounded to me like maybe they should have been rolled\n\nOut we're going to try and get to the bottom of it but it was a flat denial\nWell it was on the yesterday that President Trump was talking

little bit more consumer tree points I pulled to our correspondent barber plus OSHA in Washington\nYesterday was I Would say a sort of high note in the tension between the United states and uh and Saudi Arabia because the president has by and large pretty carefully positioned himself as the crisis has been building it's Congress that has been really outspoken about their concerns\nAbout possible uh actions but yesterday in a interview Mr Mr Trump said there would be severe punishment if\nA if the Saudis were found responsible for the death of Mr Trump G and then after that\nThe Saudis responded by saying well we will retaliate if we're going to be punished if there's any attempt to punish death and it was then that Mr Trump\nCalled his secretary of state and said you need to get on a plane and get to Saudi Arabian speak face to face with the Saudi leadership so there was a fence yesterday that things had escalated because of the first time the president and the kingdom had actually publically clash like that but you're right he has seemingly dial back somewhat today after speaking to king Solomon\nI'm saying you know emphasizing how much Mr ... how much can someone

they have\nMade threats about what will happen if that is the case they've already done\nFor evidence but they have made threats about what will happen if that is the case they've already demanded that sanctions being posed\nUm if that's the case they suggested they might hold back or block the arms sales and I even yesterday again on the talk shows or you had somebody like Senator Marco Rubio saying that if this is proving to be true there will be a strong response is going to be swift it's going to go pretty far so they are inclined um I think to be quite suspicious of what the Saudis had

basically stumble\nUm and that is all because of a crisis in Ukraine now what's happened in Ukraine is that ah the spiritual leader the ... the patriarch of some ... has essentially allowed the Ukrainian church to a declare independence from Moscow not something which the Ukraine\nOut of the church in Ukraine has been a campaigning for for many many years but not specifically pick up the ticket out after a twenty four team was of course the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the political crisis and indeed the conflict between Russia\nAnd Ukraine that's been a raging now for some for

has to take power projection and I think to lose essentially the Ukrainian faithful to lose Moscow's control over the Ukrainian church is a pretty significant blow for Russia for the church but also I was like you might be simplistic say\nSo a lot of ordinary people in Russia will be pretty disappointed\nI think that well you know today I was at the the main cathedral here and there was a there was
