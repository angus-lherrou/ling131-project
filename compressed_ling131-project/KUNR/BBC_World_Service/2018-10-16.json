let's get an idea from you about Vienna as a city and its people\nAustrian Hungary at the turn of the nineteenth century was modernizing ... a short period\nThings but changing uh especially Indiana the city grew enormously but also new ways of transportation uh implemented like the tram train even cars\nAnd ... came into the House's new ways of communication and maybe in sharp contrast to that the institutions antisocial ... did not that that that quickly\nI'm In a sense it was still quite the pre modern empire holding together many nations develop ready crackling to get into a\nSo it would seem to promote his victim now a century on from when cross ... there's not much has changed when it comes to trivia and celebrity typical capital and in what seems like a professor remark on the ease with which journalist posts\nAnd it seems like ... percent remark on the ease with which journalists politicians all business people mixed fact and fiction Crouse commented that ... of those that can be invented and controversial pronouncements lead by politicians the truth is not really truth comes in lines and\nOne can only imagine what he just sort of social media and the Internet today but cross was very focused not just on particular issues and misuse effects but also on sloppy language now tell me why was this so important to him he was he just being a pet and\nA complicated question as in many issues when it comes to cross um I think that it's important to say that there's a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic purists someone who only saw models of language and figures like Shakespeare to ensure there are many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing from early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then it's just pure swell and I think that um this image as as a misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand cross his views on language\nI'm In its relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it succinctly cross saw language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so one ... and I think are writing ... crosses mind could mean many things that could mean\nNot including a comma due to editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability or to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and thought coke constitute their co form one another\nThis for cross was all an indication that there was something deeply arise in the morality of the author or more likely a one ...\nI'm deeply arise in the morality of the author or more likely a one could say of the morality of the society in which such language could be received and produced so critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate what I'm Talking about one of cross as more humorous pieces are set of pieces is what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries man by the name of ... million heart and\nCross calls this piece Esperanto a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consists of multiple pages of heart in excessively floor pros juxtapose then against cross his so called translations of these phrases into more accessible direct language\nAnd cross does this I take it that what he's doing is he's exposing some of the ideological underpinnings that are in heart in language but that has language actually obscures and so this is kind of one example of how cross seeks to relate\nSloppy language to either hidden duplicitous ... or moral failure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSo by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally bad grammar wherever he's talking about more than that and they have yeah and he's a schools are fully religions to classic works of Jim and ... and Shakespeare as you've said and he was a continued the ... tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich basically short pithy often surprising and funny expressions of the truth or principle you've heard a few these already and\n... stunted including the Indy faculty from about Nineteen Ninety six and late to publish them in book for several times but he himself was aware of the limitations\nAn aphorism nether coincides with the truth it is either a half truth or\nWith the trick is either a ... year old woman to half truths\nThat Vienna also had a prestigious the it's a tradition something that I think was particularly important across infant throughout his life he gave hundreds of one month shows don't be Katrina why was it so important to him\nWhen I think I always had a really ambivalent relationship to the U.S yet that he wanted to become an actor at first that didn't work out and um he very much disliked modern development for instance I'm\nThe director max Reinhardt who was very famous that cross this time in Germany especially um he developed very on a mentally very showy um productions\nAnd contrary to cross he kind of embrace that yet of blender\nBut what Crosse imagined or was it ... just the stage for the spoken word and not to edit pieces to shorten them and and make room for for the stage but to really stay with the drama\nUh itself and nothing else\n[noise] so the picture on getting of crass than is before the first World War II is someone who is surrounded by lots of colleagues fellow officers\nFriends and someone but at the same time he's a bit of an outsider which which is probably other choice and pulled the others circumstance I mean this is fascinating psychologically I mean I read that he feels like a double outside in Vienna because he was born in a small town in what is now the Czech Republic and ... and be full\nOf and also because he was Jewish\nI think uh to kind of reiterate one of the most points he he despise the idea of being associated with any particular group\n... points he he despise the idea of being associated with any particular group or be that ethnic religious political um I think that he saw dangers in completely you know absorbing oneself and those collective identities and I think he was especially opposed to the idea of being associated with\nA group simply because one was born into it simply because causes born into a small bohemian town or because he was born Jewish and I think that's partially explains also crosses lifelong I Would say fairly deeply ambivalent attitude toward his own or relationship maybe better said to his own\nJewish identity um but just to give another example crosses thoroughly booth law but his sympathies in his early life lay with the aristocracy and then as he became more politicized much more so with the working class so in sometimes never with the class to which he\nI'm officially belong to me I think this is one example of seeing crosses outsider status at work\nFor all his public pronouncements ... was ... men and kept his personal life to himself but we do know that is great love listed than eat not hung up\nAbout ... and patron of the ... based in a small shall we say about a hundred miles south of classes but based in what is now the Czech Republic and the only country in the ... was that relationship like\nBy the first and foremost it had to be a secret relationship um been that in Nineteen Thirteen one yeah before the war and as he didn't he now Daniel's CD as he called ... she inspired class to like poetry\nAnd he also wrote 'em over a thousand that has to hurt you and the closest of relationship the relationship lasted with interruptions interests\nRelationship last it with interruptions until his death\nAnd maybe it's especially noteworthy that crossed yet his hands full with a his work you just mentioned the nine hundred and twenty two issues of the fucking that didn't he didn't mean that Danny's case uh he really sat down and wrote like every other day a very long letter\nHer lettuce to him my last um we don't have them\nBut do we know from his letter that he shows have very different kind of personality and in that means really in love you I think he would have wanted to marry her she would not\nShe wanted to marry properly another race the crowd but she's still kept having a relationship with cross continue to meet him to travel to gather\nAnd you can really call her one of the most important uh women ... quite a few so that he had this lonely images and through yet actually quite a full of life I think\nAnd incidentally has oh she provided a quiet place to rest and worked for him and she may have inspired some of ground says best a lyric perjury here is the end of a poem cooled to wrinkle in you\nTend to well remembered line praying a suit to rest muscle so that this

early on and more so than\nProbably Ninety five percent of his contemporaries but his position toward the monarchy had actually changed quite drastically over the course of the war\nFrom what we could call earlier support the institution to becoming actually arguably it's most ardent critic\nUm I Would actually argue that Kraus as the war was dragging on especially did not only really anticipate the outcome as it was but that eventually he really desired it because he knew that it would bring this could have decadent aging and when he saw as wholly moral institution to ruin\nThat is the very institution that actually ... who's the war on its subjects and the first place\nIn the first few years of the post war period he became what the scholar Edward Tim's is called a quote reluctant Democrat that is to say that cross was always a bit hesitant to fully endorsed the political changes that were transpiring\nWhat concerned cross initially was the economic misery after the war that led so many to become actually in the stall jak\nFor something like the good old days the kind of you know make Austria great again even though as cross repeatedly said in various different ways that it was the monarchy that's ultimately responsible for bringing the war which is ultimately responsible for the misery so Kraus as sort of again you know in his kind of enlightenment\nUm attack trying to connect the dots I'm Better than they were actually being connected by many of of all students citizens so I guess the type of thing they cross embrace democracy and even for a while the Social Democrats although that relationship became more tenuous as the twenties when on\n'em but he kept an eye a very keen on\nAnd us as the twenties went on\nA but he kept an eye a very keen eye on the

Japanese society in a moment but I should say that ... she denies the allegations and you saw the civil case against him and miss\nAnd you filed a civil case against him and museum and Gucci is defending the civil case that's hit your case is a very different what made you decide to find a lawsuit against you form of both in twenty sixteen\nShowing two thousand six cents sadly I was with ... from very high profile purchaser in Georgia\nSo he was making sexual advances towards you yeah favors yeah sexual favors could you explain to us what was the working environment at the TV station ... was it like for you you know working within the environment's\nSo Georgia societies like struggling with all the gender inequality and sexual misconduct and family side of fantasize that swing women

said was not comments anymore she was asking for sexual favors from me regard\nShe was asking for sexual favors from me regarding guy was striking to lost my job\nSo they saw the last moment I realized I was in trouble they saw such kinds of formulation and they're supposed to return so unfair\nThat type just couldn't it's being a silence and doing nothing so of course I denied it and I went to court civil rights cards\nSo he said if you didn't given the sexual favors he free to do with the loss of your job yeah and as I understand it the new news against sexual harassment in Georgia so how did you go about bringing this case decode\nYeah there is no particular like isolation against sexual misconduct tar as meant in Georgia but we have this on to discriminate law where we have this part of sexual misconduct toward women\nSo with collaboration calling Joe's we want this case also my case was before me to campaign and that's for me to campaign he was kind of fly sink and car

Georgia an in Japan both of them now campaigning on behalf of women's rights\nI'm speaking broadly about sexual violence in Japan and in Georgia how big stigma is it to be a victim of sexual violence in Japan she Henri\nThere is very strong stigma against rape victim here in Japan and even talking about sex is quite to boo but the thing is if you go out to sit in Tokyo and\nIf you go to coming in store let's say you see these magazines ways woman bikini or naked women\nAnd I feel like there are many symbols and pictures and what you will see a woman being sexually objected but yet talking about sex isn't very often and hearing Japan\nAnd in a traditional media like newspaper especially it wasn't come on to talk about or said that word or put the word of right\nIn the newspaper so they often use the word such as violated or if the victim is under aged than they were ...\nThe victim is under aged than they would say they were tricked so it it's Olson covered was different wars and it's just really hard to know what is actually going on\nTo to enjoy what you what is the situation say when it comes to sexual violence and the stigma around it\nYeah also in Georgia we have a huge stigma about rape and sexual violence bunch Georgian Government to snow doing\nSomething because we have very high statistics of famous site in Georgia we have very patriarchal system it's kind of

I think all of this shows that there needs to be something other than what the Saudis have put forward so far because the crisis has been building overtime\nYou wouldn't use on the line from the BBC in London\nHe\nWas news on the line from the BBC in London on Tim Frank's\nHere on the program we've tried in recent months to bring you the story behind what appears to be one of the biggest if not the biggest mass internment programs in the world\nIs in western China in the ... region and it's over we are Muslims rights groups say that huge numbers of detainees held indefinitely without charge\nFor infractions like refusing to give a DNA sample speaking in a minority language\nNow the top official ... is giving them as detailed description yeah to these camps will vocational education education centers as short as I can put it in an interview on state media he said detainees were grateful for the opportunity to change their ways\nThey provided with free food is what his classes on Chinese history\nRyan some some experts in weaker ... university\nIn the English Midlands\nWhat does he make ... account of the camps\nIt seemed to me that is so hot soccer's argument boils down to the idea that because we're providing air conditioning and other sorts of basic comfort them of extrajudicial imprisonment is something that's acceptable\nIs significant the fact that he was given the interview told as it suggests that the Chinese or perhaps\nBeginning to feel a little bit of heat from outside about what these interim camp so ... educational centers as they brother we called him how this scene from the outside\nI Do think this shows some concern with how their view but at the same time that the interview was given the week before that\nView but at the same time that that interview was given to the week before the end on government in trying\nThese camp in law so that there's really no\nUse to using these rather they're trying to defend them then\nThat fled criticism so that they can maintain them over the long term\nThere have also as part of his today being a quotes supposedly from people who puffed through these in terms of terms praising them for the assistance they have given them in terms of trying to\nUnderstand China and to make them more productive person\nDo scribe food that trust me any value\nFirst I should note that the evidence for people leaving these camps is very slim there they're not a lot of people of these several hundred thousand two million estimate of people who have been in turn who have actually gotten out from what we could see from the outside but it's worth noting that those who have\nGotten out are those who have been quoted in the Chinese media tend to say very similar things this is not the first time we've heard that\nThey're actually news reports for more of a domestic audience that have come out with subjects of the re education push and they tend to say things like the party helped me learn to distinguish from right and wrong I Would even unaware my cells of what it done wrong they kept me off of the road to a terrible future and they made me a\nGood contributor to society it appears that one of the things they're learning in the internment indoctrination camp is what to say to convince their captors that they should be released\nFrom your understanding when people do get into these into urban centers how careful\nDon't know how long people will be kept for right now there are hundreds of thousands or over a million\nWe don't know how long people will be kept for right now there are hundreds of thousands or over\nA million people who have been sent there in a very small number who have been released and\nOf all the people that I personally know who have relatives or friends and it does include myself who are you know him\nI can think of only one person who told me that their relatives have left the camp so right now this is an open question\nRowing you said that you ... friends and relatives who are in these camps is that right friends not rents are you concerned or two about speaking out\nThe time for a concern about speaking out I think has had\nRight now one can be sent to the camp for things that small as\nNot greeting an official on the street giving up smoking not watching government television being up smoking that's like giving up smoking giving up drinking encouraging others to do though these are seen as kind of extremism\nAnd the point about giving up smoking I'm giving up drinking is it what is it seen as a sign of Islamic indoctrination\nYeah that's right any sign of piety or concern about religious practices is seen as some kind of step on the road to ... is one that inspired terrorism\nRyan some weakest specialist at

was already formed and they\nAsked me to sing with all the time and it was a band that had to call her full name and so that's where the Republicans are using to attack me I said they were not allowed to use on the right of it says pieces of a\nCar ... in a radical censor school days and call\nAnd this is how 'bout radio attack ad frames the contest against a military veteran\nWell equals dropping

have a good guard dog\nAlso braving the neighborhood dogs a decidedly known punk Republican opponent don't bacon is a one term congressman and a retired air force general\nScared of everything so it's not very highly processed make it out there that I saw him making but anyway uh\nI think all yes the name I notice he made the bacon joke that I Do every time [laughter]\nI have an ad right now I'm

like he says that he's turning out the heat's on his opponent I'm pro union I don't have any issues I got ... or say we're\nGetting a dual Smith from traditionally democratic supporting unions you feel uneasy with the ... moved to the left\nI Know in this district they wanted to ask a conservative represented though not on a Bernie Sanders democratic socialist Annette and that's the choice in this race her positions maybe play well San Francisco and Berkeley maybe New York they don't play well in Nebraska\nWell you know what they say here in Nebraska if you don't like ... what the weather wait a couple of minutes\n[laughter] that's about it [laughter] something snowstorm descends on Omaha as I get to meet the city's full moon\nI saw snow storm descends on Omaha as I get to meet the city's full moon democratic man my boil he doesn't agree the current Eastman will lose traditional democratic votes is arguing that has sent at these policies no longer on the fringe\nShe's not to the left she's really speaking out to what needs to happen it's it's the logical change that needs to come from progressive systems of government\nSo you're saying the center of gravity of the Democratic party\nHas changed is changing well I think the center of gravity for the whole country has changed because\nThere are people now who have no medical care where one of the few countries in the world or they're supposed to be civilized that doesn't take care of our people through healthcare so this is nothing radical\nOr the history of our the Democratic party has been progressive always has I mean it's just like I said Social Security Medicare Medicaid this\nIs just the next logical step I think it's ... ...\n... you know a couple more questions are I\nHave young they can campaign volunteers campus votes we get the view of the wise old man of the Republican Party how do full term congressman and to tell the mayor of Omaha he says the bacon Eastman contest has national implications\nSo so think about this race for the house seat here as a bellwether indicator not only of how things are now but how they may be drifting over the next two years seems to me that if done baking the Republican nominee\nSeems to me that if done baking the Republican nominee wins here that will be a signal that the composition of the voter be that Republican Democrat male or female\nRural or urban or suburban\nIs still leaning objectively moderately till the right\nHere with race at all as I Am head at this point in time you or of oh I see him\nOn the doorstep county's been seems to be winning hearts minds ... votes but will it be enough for victory was brutally conservative state like Nebraska send the progressive punk fund to Washington a question for the support says she's just spoken to that don't ...\nI Believe that there is potential for a movement based on current political standings and maybe I should say I hope versus I Believe\n... not necessarily believe for that democratic votes will only rise I spoke to rugs on MORNING political reporter with the Omaha world Harold she told me that is unusual congressional races shaping up to be the most expensive one this swing district has ever seen at at the moment she says the funding momentum seems to be with Kara Eastman\nRaise one point two five million dollars in the last three months that triples what she had the four and she got a lot of money from individuals as opposed to committees are groups are companies or whatever and and it's from all across the country she's become it shows that she's become\nThe country she's become it shows that she's become this kind of figure head in the progressive movement\nAnd does that mean that this race and this one district does as we heard there from the former math become this bellwether for how the Democratic party use is running and where it is going\nYes so the um progressive groups that want to prove they can win in swing districts are looking to this state she is one of the one of the only ones that this kind of new crop of leaders that in\nA conservative area so if she can win here you're going to see a lot more progressive trying to make the case in other swing districts that they can win and then they should get national support because look parties and did it\nIs there's something about what's happening here in Omaha Nebraska has brought to to the top and the Democratic policy or is it simply a a national picture oh so the\nDemographics of Omaha haven't changed all that much but I Do think that this isn't the year for progressive and you're seeing that here as well as elsewhere ... we had progressive in Omaha\nBefore um but they never had a candidate to rally around like this and a lot of her policies are becoming kind of mainstream democratic principles and so you're seeing and she she has more opportunities this year than she would have previously\nNow we're talking about midterm elections which don't generally get huge turnout so I'm not going to be key to this so she's got some money she's got a bit of momentum she'd go energy nationwide\nSome she'd go energy nationwide but will necessarily translate into votes so that's a good\nQuestion so her whole hypothesis is that she needs to give voter that Democrats in Nebraska should give voters or reason to be excited and then they'll show up when they haven't shown on previously for the more moderates so she's doing a lot of door knocking as you've heard and she's seen a lot of outreach to voters directly because her whole strategy is trying to turn out the boats\nAnd you don't see many of us we had a dumb bacon with is sizzling bacon I vote but he ... he said on the TV every cough it up but you don't see it\nShe she does have some ads she's not focusing on it as much you might seem more ads from her because she got that one point five million on but she also has been a lot of her money on voter outreach which isn't the traditional typical path they take\n'em what about the Trump ... how does how does he play into this race in this state so\nTrump um came here and spoke and bacon spoke on stage with him on\nRight now it seems that cabin his nomination of cabinet in particular is actually turning on both sides so Democrats are really mad about cabinet but you're also seeing Republican mad about how Democrats handled it and one thing that I'm hearing a lot from Republican women is that\nThey are upset that liberal women have kind of been speaking for all women and they want to send a message no we're not\nWhat the the ... these other women say that we are\nWearing a from ... how old she was speaking to news estranged coral so I mean he was still on the line of Jamie I hesitate to suggest that the piece was anything other than definitive but have you go to the mall to save from some\nAnything I was a definitive but have you got anything more to say from somewhere else in the U.S\n[laughter] it's a big country isn't it to him in the ... from the house races all four hundred and thirty five members of the house of representatives I woke up for reelection a third of the Senate up for
