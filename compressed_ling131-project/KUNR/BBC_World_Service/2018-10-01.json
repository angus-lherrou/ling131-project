the deal up as a present a rope young is here's what exactly is happening\nIn the north American free trade agreements has been around for the past quarter century but Donald Trump or when he was

residents refused to go what will happen you will they go ahead and bulldoze their spinach\nBail bulldozed the village and forcibly displaced a presumably the the residents to different location ... I'm\nJust remind us so why does the government wanted to demolish it\nThere's a few levels you have to understand here the the reasoning that the government is giving is that it's a simple planning issue which you know sounds innocent enough but there's two other issues a place here and one is that we're talking about occupied territory\nAnd according to human rights groups of the Palestinian authority is and uh most world leaders forcibly displaced during that protected population occupied territory is anything from a war crime to a great for each of international law and on the geopolitical level it the location of the village is very very important\nUm it's it's in a place of the west bank where if\nThe Palestinian population is removed and Israeli settlements come in to replace them where there's already settlements or\nExist and there are many people say that it would it would cut the west bank into two different pieces I'm making a contiguous territory impossible should we ever see some sort of piecemeal mhm and it would also cut off East Jerusalem which many people are\nThe Palestinians and much of the world believe to be a will be the capital of the ... of a Palestinian state and then cut it off from the rest of the west bank\nPiece of people have been living here since the Nineteen fifties now the Israeli government said the structures we built on state owned land without ...\nThe Nineteen fifties now these really government said the structures we built on state owned land without comments from the Israeli miniature ... which undid the Nineteen Ninety three also call it's has exclusive control over construction in sixty percent of the west bank known as Area C suggests this fall within ...\nIt does the residents claim that it's actually privately owned land owned by a a a nearby a Palestinian town\nUh but the other thing you have to understand about Area C and and there's really control there is that the Israeli military which is responsible for approving a building permits and in that area that you mentioned denies\nWell over Ninety percent of Palestinian requests for building permits and the residents of one of the smart one of their their last ditch attempts to stave off this this demolition was to submit a their own planning\nAnd their own master plan for for normalizing the the the the building permits of of their village and something that Israeli government allows settlers Jewish Israeli settlers to do when when they're caught building a what the Israeli government uh describes says go ahead\nMichael surely the Israeli government then has offered them an alternative place to go to despite an international objection to this has been an alternative pace and where would that be than\nThere is it's a location not too far away um\nIt's a girl so very close to a trash dumped a which is you can imagine it's not as not ideal for this for this residents and the other the other problem they have with it is but it's it would ah presumably stop them from a continuing their\nUh their lifestyle which involves are hurting\nAnd another agrarian aspects\nOkay and it has become an international issue we said there's been a note of international objection to this including the un advising against it but Israel has not and nascent has gone to head\nThis including the un advising against it that Israel has not ... and ... and has gone to head with the ... what's likely to happen if they should go ahead\nYou know the Israeli government has been trying to [noise] to sort of take over this area and remove the Palestinian population for a few decades now and up until the Trump Administration the Americans and the rest of the world have essentially told the Israeli government do not do this ...\nAnd now there's very little resistance and the European Parliament orange that it would be a grave reach of international law uh last year the\nMany European countries warned Israel that there would be a reaction if this happened but it doesn't seem that there's any any real threat\nOkay Michael I'm the editor in chief of the thing is raining academe plus nine seven two\nScientists was discovered that

place after all about so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThat impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually well captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey stick jobs a graph tossing global average temperature is over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fired up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks at least nine among annual average age of ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages or any parts of the climate story ... ... ... that matters to us\nOften we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers\nToo often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on the earth to continue to increase and that has huge ramifications for global sea level rise for melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nLevel rise for melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather and those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes\nAnd so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes are changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time honored television screens in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless Oslo to watch to be cautious weather of some kind of group does happen every year\nYou know write that one into what Iran is not necessarily\nHarming our what we can say the reason why do attribution any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's\nRight to say this is something different or something that needs to be quite rare and is now or anything in common and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived periods of heat heat waves\nThe atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods at the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you'd take extreme drought you combine it with extreme heat\nFrom soils you get worse droughts you'd take extreme drought you combine it with extreme heat\nYou're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science or as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is the fact that climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream\nIn a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger an apple two ... and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the high struck the jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks\nThey also put another high over Siberia with high heat that an over North America where the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California with seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael Mann\nIt's getting warmer in warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress\nUm the summer droughts are so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires in what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season in California Winter isn't\nNow California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was the Thomas wildfire last winter in Southern California only this\nThe Thomas wildfire last winter and Southern California only this summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire northern California and some other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication of the\nThe profound challenged the climate changes already\nPosing to us\nFrom our historic your mind is the largest fire warning about the size of Los Angeles [noise]\n\nThese are the conditions lived and experience fine then yeah queen Davidson fire experts at the University of California\nCompounded the tree stressing effects of long term Trump was enough rain in northern California last winter to stimulate a surge of bras gross to add an abundance of drawing on the gross which fueled far storms\nIn some parts of California we had a hundred and eighty percent of normal for graft production so I think a lot of fire people were thinking\nYou know this just isn't looking good and all it's going to take is an ignition on the right day with the right whether to cause a real problem and so when the Carr Fire started I was over here I live on the coast and suffered from some of the hot weather and things like that but\nPretty immediately that fire was raising hairs and my husband actually went over and worked on that fire and um I I think we we're all feeling tension that we're not used to feeling around fire in California we've had it you know the last\nTen years we've had unprecedented fires almost every every year every other year but the Carr Fire felt different\nBecause ... affecting a major residential\nFelt different because ... affecting a major

week\nThere was the ranch fire and the river fire and those were burning near to each other on the north and west sides of clear lake which is one of the largest lakes in California it was during the height of the summer so the hottest days over a hundred degrees solid winds blowing through those areas it was\nJust all the right conditions for fast fire spread and extreme fire behavior and so the spiders grew so quickly\nThey were sometimes burning twenty thousand acres in a twenty four hour period or were more maybe\nThe the rate of growth made it very difficult for Cruz to to get a handle on it and they ended up burning four hundred and ten thousand acres and I we all have heard that that's the biggest fire in California history I think that the next biggest was last year in Southern California at two hundred and eighty thousand acres so\nA very large area\nOf course is not just being heat waves and fires while California burned in countless times and yet they had the worst

face it you said you're a Democrat you're going to walk the walk as well as talk talk and I respect that but if one looks at current polling and you say well when you you'll why the movement has been around for a couple of years but you are news so the fact you were scoring books\nFor a couple of years but you on you so the fact you're from scoring virtually zero in the polls will let that pass

right now where\nThe left in its more radical form is actually doing well or at least gaining traction with a significant part of the population is in the United kingdom this so want make can you know

well you sound fusing issue\nIf you're not confused when you're facing a confusing issue you're fanatical but given the Kobus position on bricks that remains even off the Labour Party conference

effectively tied the economy's growth on two bottles on the housing bubble and on the city of London and he's causing any assessment of these women with it\nAlready is interesting and so you would say because you talked about last generation of politicians in the u._k. who in your view played that sort of neo liberal economic ... you would say the Tony Blair was in no way left of center politician would you\nWhat does it mean\nThe one hand he lost because he gave a lot of money ... money that they thought he said stop that national health service off but at the very same time\nHe did it by aligning himself fully with a city of London turning a blind eye to the private money ... thing of the private banks and creating the circumstances that lead to because I was in an eight and to the collapse into has in the night so we bought\nI'm getting too is that the John Macdonald ... the the current shadow chancellor of the exchange of hearing the case has made a big speech where he's painted a picture of a radical economic program including just one example the man the tree imposition on business in the u._k. ever need to have\nTen percent of ... given to the workers in the company that dividends would then go to those workers and\nThat would be a cap on the amount of David and to be received by each worker on the excess beyond that would go to the government so it would actually be a huge new corporate tax it would fundamentally change the relationship between the state and the corporate sector in the u._k. in a very sort of left of center way\nDo you really believe the British people are going to vote for\nThat I think so and I'm very glad to have hut or John Macdonald put forward there have been proposing to McDonald about in the program we eras things you've been saying society proposing is precisely that\nThe things you've been saying society proposing precisely that with one difference I've been proposing the creation of a social but fund where that ten percent of the shadows after\nEvery ideal or capitalizing by corporations go into the public will fund and then the dividends how distributed the former universal basic dividend\nWhereas they were by the is leaving them up amongst the workers within those corporations but what I think is very important to remember this is not even need the money factor yet this is part of the Labour Party conference he may go into the money first of all I Hope it does\nIf he's a very interesting discussions are that we must have even the thought is must have\nAbout the division between competent labor but it differently saving once upon a time when and that sort of both the machine that machine belong to the ... list and then they ... who claimed the profits of the machine produced for the company\nBut these days of Google and Facebook when every time you such and your Google Search engine for something you're providing capital to Google and no one is getting a defense for that except for Google we have to concede that property rights over that intensive capital and live that everybody is the only party in the world\nThat is doing these okay so for you definitely the u._k. labor party represents a beacon of hope but throughout this interview you've been saying we must do this we must do that and I've been pointing out that actually\nIn the real world and the world of politics and opinion polls your ideas are not gaining very much traction if we leave the United kingdom so I disagree with you is\nIs there any way of looking at some point say to yourself you know what democratic politics doesn't what we're going to find new ways one labor MP in what I'm saying she said recently that\nWe're going to find new ways one labor MP you know what I'm saying she said recently and there's no such that we need to topple the government and we can't do it at the ballot box\nWe will do it with a general strike by working with the trade unions is that you kind of policy

are dangerous times with their eyes of extremists around the world and we have to be very clear in our language and the and the way that we support democracy\nSo to answer that great I'm going to quote from Winston Churchill\nThe Democratic process is a pretty awful it's pretty nasty but it's the best of all of a sudden there's and we have to be prepared to defend it with our lives I think

services center\nWell George magnet is still with us to discuss this and indeed the wider infrastructure plans of the Chinese government\nI'm Joe ... basically this is the point is that the China has this record has done for twenty thirty forty years it's been to spend its way through rocky times it will spend money on the big planning projects I think it's\nGoing to launch dividend out of doing that it has a historically\nThe large dividend out of doing that\nIt has a historically um something changed in a two thousand eight actually is the financial crisis in the west\nStarted to send ripples through China\nUm and uh it was actually a time when the Chinese economy itself was actually going through a little bit of its own kind of tipping point\nSo really what's happening in the last ten years in particular I Would say\nThat the the Chinese government has actually relied on infrastructure for two reasons one to offset downturns in the economy so every time they called me looks like it's looking a little bit worldly I'm you get ... to build more infrastructure intellect more money to infrastructure projects in provinces and local governments\nAre on the other is because they they really believe this um the rhetoric about a ... and leads to you know better growth and she has a huge contentious issue because some of us believe that she the sequencing works the other way round that actually you get better urbanized ... from having good growth model\nOr because actually if it was a simple than every would you need for groceries just build big cities\n... ... a declining yields from building more things you can't go on building things forever and it wasn't always give you the same pretend that it did it the ...\nYes indeed and I think again you know like so many things in China everything's so nuanced so if you look at China's a residential buildings and its infrastructure or a head of population of course it still some way behind Japan\nA soul in Asia or you know American cities and European cities bought 'em you know as little kinds that kind of famous British economist once said in the long run world\nAs ... the kind of famous British economist ones that in the long run we're all dead and what we have to be concerned about really is about the miss allocation of capital in the short term which actually can lead to you know empty apartment blocks coast cities and and actually quite a lot of problem\nAnd it can also lead who goes to a huge amounts of public debt where how biggies Chinese public debt well a ...\nIt is about ... at the end of two thousand and Seventeen was around three hundred and thirty percent of its national income which is just over three times as big as it was ten years ago\nThat sounds like a very big number it is a big number I mean we don't really know to be fat whether that there is any magical number which point you know a crisis ensues bought certainly the the miss allocation of resources\nThe cumulative increase its difficulties which smaller Chinese banks are facing a funding bad loans and other words they have to raise deposits and\nIf they can't raise them from households they are raising them

rather than just becoming a ... say that so they seem satisfied in that regard\nAnd and what about the handover of power or both of these leaders the outgoing and the incoming one is happy about that does each other\nWell Mr Lopez Obrador himself hasn't spoken but to his negotiate his we'll see how they hatch who said we celebrate the attorney Laffer agreement so underlining if I Try not to he said it closes the door to trade fragmentation if the region\nNAFTA to as he could it which I thought it was quite interesting we'll give stability or\nUncertainties and mixed collide with its North American partners and outgoing president then to get up and you do have said he'd spoken to both prime minister and President Trump this morning and cool the agreement a win win win so you know at this stage both sides so at least sounding pleased with the result\nThanks very much well let's turn to the Canadian side of things at this is what President Trump had to say about American farmers\nThe deal includes a substantial increase in our farmers opportunities to export American we poultry eggs and dairy including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific [noise]\nOr some some luxuries scoops of ice cream we understand but to will become agents like this possible deal Jessica [noise]\nWell look if this is considered a win for you as far as it is very much less so for Canadian dairy they're definitely a couple of concessions made by the Canadian team that's including increasing the slice of the dairy market available to us producers from about one percent two three point six\nPercent and the dairy farmers are not at all\nHappy about it they're saying that really this is putting their their future of the future of their families at risk especially since Canada this is not the first time that Canada has increased access to its dairy market as part of a trade deal notably with the recent seat a deal with the European Union\nNow this could spell some trouble for Trudeau in the upcoming election which is coming up in twenty Nineteen especially in the province of Quebec where there are a lot of dairy farmers\nAll that said what to do is saying today is look at first off the U.S was really seeking a complete dismantling of Canada supply management system around dairy\nThat was the original us demand it is very much pare down there just getting more access he's also promising full compensation for dairy farmers in Canada so that should take some of the sting out of his concession\nOn what about the personal relationship as being some pretty ... times between the leaders of kind of during the United states in recent months but they're also founding courtroom today well sure assessment\nI think is the word a U.S president Donald Trump use to today describing\nSome of the relationship between him and Trudeau in recent months and I think that's fair I think it was the most heated around June around the G. seven meeting and come back we're Trudeau came out saying that Canada would not be pushed around by the U.S on trade a Trump came out calling him Meek mild week\nTrue came out saying that candidate would not be pushed around by the U.S on trade Trump came out calling unique mild weak and and not really just showed that there was a lot of tension between the two when it came trade now at least for today it looks like it's water under the bridge this may sound like they apply to too but\nThe candidate and us relationship has weathered a lot of storms between the leaders leaders have not always gotten a lot and I think that that time you go deeper than than sometimes politics and sometimes these disagreements that happened between between leaders\nJessica ... thanks very much Gary uh down here in Washington is a quick thought you mentioned that this is a kind of deal that will appeal to some of those votes as in the er the post industrial Midwestern states we should be so important to President Trump and his presidential victory do you think this will have an impact on the midterm elections that are coming up\nI think it's possible I think it's possible that will motivate some of the base of the voted for him to come out and say sign cute or in some in that sense all their votes has\nNever really thank you for things you've done or new for things you promising to do other farmers may may do the same but so the president has out to sacrifice something he's given up for example his insistence on on scrapping who the chops and Nineteen policy of NAFTA which is the arbitration mechanism the Canadians of\nOf their own why on that and of course the other big thing that's still in place is the steel and aluminum tariffs twenty five and ten percent both\nOn Canada and Mexico those are still in place and the president saying they're not going to go see it as part of his predecessor\nGary are Donahue in Washington before that we heard from Jessica Murphy in

member of the parliamentary committee on international trade on the line from also I asked him whether he was happy with the deal\nThis is absolutely fantastic it's such a positive step forward from where we were with the American administration is you know extremely protection you know we have the deal\nA framework ... deal incredible and you know we continue to work this deal and will make things better for all three parties and in this particular uh agreement not\nEveryone is happy though one Canadian companies direct to the United steelworkers said there was sold out some stealing ... by not getting rid of the twenty five percent steel tariffs and the ten percent highly medium ... says that had to be some compromise that are not all of your voters will be happy about\nThat particular matter American president used to be to a national security measure that is\nSeparate from the than at the negotiations to put tariffs on steel and aluminum\nAround the world including Canada and uh our government is committed to you know supporting the industry for two billion dollars into play to support workers and the industry and to strengthen\nThe steel industry and limited strikes along and that's one piece and put in place dollar for dollar counter terrorists so to names deal since very positive because it's moving forward in a positive manner and I've spoken with prime minister and I've spoken with history of trade I Amish are they are committed to\nGetting this positive the momentum to continue to grow shading\nAnd getting rid of those tariffs because that will be a win win for both of us 'cause uh businesses are affected on both sides of the border you\nStarted your comments by saying the U.S administration is fundamentally protectionist that's no change that has it and despite this deal us still going to have a fine tune your hands to keep the kind of trade that you want with it how you\nGot to keep you know redouble our efforts and I think\nTo keep the kind of trade that you want with it how you\nGot to keep you know redouble our efforts and I think that's why this field is an extremely positive step forward and we gotta keep on this momentum and just keep working it's obviously we\nHave the number of months ahead for us where we roll up our sleeves and and you to work together because we put dollar for dollar and on steel and aluminum but we've also put tariffs on a number of other steel products and it will be and everyone's best interest for us to to get rid of those tariffs which would be to\nWhich which is essentially it ... it is it's not good economics\nIt's it's not good for anyone so I think it cutting off the ministry ration of putting the two thirty two on autos which would have been devastating for the economy is on both sides was critical in this agreement and also support the steel industry because that's one of the number one of the places where the steel ends I\nBriefly um than President Trump said he was in love with Kim Jong un yesterday do you think he's back in love with the Justin Trudeau all I can tell you what the minister\nJustin Trudeau has been absolutely amazing he drew a
