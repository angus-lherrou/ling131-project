I came on ... on the late to legacy ... pandemic [noise]\nRules are always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules but then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precise or you're trying to write a book that's full casual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time\nOne of the things that helps us as\nA game as translate into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book we'll send it off the translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or have to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nWas asked languages from other countries filtering back in the game design\nIn their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be globally all affected in some way I mean you'd like in Germany can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nIf not it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon put that on a cover you just won't sell it and Germany so it it'd be a thing of the culture you have to think of a language that we think of how people played\nSo we kind of postal German fatigue with combat games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cooperative games like that [noise] it fit into what were called German games the nineties and then you're all games which was the interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of a version to direct conflict\nThey added designed games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else who said you sort of passively aggressively got in a place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only get it you can have your person there I can and I get there first I technically I've been taking anything from you know I just prevented you from getting something\nWhich on the surface is is both the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about board games like what if we were all just racing to do better\nAnd there's been this blossoming of game design over the past Twenty years

course women's right to serve us female in moms today it is still too many Muslims something very rare and and strange and before we started the last two years ago in Denmark\nThe majority of Muslims

you're gonna have to I don't want to do not\nWant to be friends with the Saudis I was talking about the conservatives or the tradition in this because the majority of Muslims and then like a

disseminate\nUnited says on his arm in Europe and abroad and we're not only talking this is about creating change on the ground and if we look at this at changes that we have made so far and let me give you an example then assess a team of interfaith marriages today\nMuslim women cannot marry outside their face unless the men converts to Islam unless you are cultural Muslim or you do not\nReally practice um so this is actually a ... an acute dilemma and we have couples coming from Norway Sweden Denmark and friends even UK to get married in the mosque because we are able to serve them and we are\nRereading the Koran and with a focus on gender equality allowing less than women to marry non Muslims\nIn Tunisia they've changed the law last year in December Seventeen so now it's also legally possible to marry outside Islam for a woman it has always been a possibility for the men because it's stated clearly in the Koran that a Muslim and can marry a Jew or Christian or non Muslim\nBut the the opposite is not stay the candy but he does not stated either that a woman ... so we use that as audited Timothy\nYou're going to approve of their own many people in ... a politician just right from the far right\nPoliticians of the rights in the far right secularists those who have a deep suspicion of Islam and all of its films who look at you and feel that you represent a danger because you you appear to make\nIslam more acceptable to a Danish mines that went in fact they say many of your core attitudes are just the sort of aliens to Danish values as the so called Islamists\nAnd very little minority or having that we're getting that stay\nWell let's go through a few of the specific points about you you claimed at the beginning of the money ... experiment all the founding of the most you said you were going to have mixed friday prayers at when you get it then you ... and now that's not friday prayers I don't believe you do a mixed ... lead\nWas true but I didn't back off when you create a community\nPeople come and then join you that's a policy democracy so the majority they voted for women's mosque on friday\nBecause they wanted to to establish a magical fear with women only when women could say what they want and express themselves\nAnd in the beginning I was really I was really sad about back home for it I didn't back off I accept and that's the power democracy you had to let the majority of the ... I had to uh I have to make the constitution and because of confusion is vital\nWhen you want to create change you have to understand the odd a flourishing if you've done all the richest behind you cannot be a bridge builder is I I I I realize later on that because\nI realize later on that\nBecause we have a women's ... only on friday at all other base it's fun that we have men coming from different countries to pray because we are centered in the middle of Copenhagen ... only mosque very thought I had my life my point was that if you want to create change have to do it slowly and ... and we can to rewrite of those shows\nLike the interfaith marriages given women the right to divorce we can do these things\nBecause we actually unsafe theological violent because nobody can criticize that\nYou are making such interesting points I Need to pick a way of looking at it like to go philosophy is fascinating move slowly you say never bone you'll bridges and that by that way you achieved

plane with the Saudi ambassador tonka yesterday and some Turkish diplomats and from what I witnessed or that they were preparing to do the investigation citing today\nDid you talk to the ambassador about this case\nNot very much I wasn't sitting right next to him but he just had a brief conversation where he said they're cooperating fully the Turkish authorities and people should not jump to conclusions before the investigation was over\nI mean there are two issues here on there which is set to already the Saudis have let journalists into the consulate before allowing Turkish officials I mean not snow ideal is it\nWell I don't know what kind of a strategy they have in mind but they're under quite public pressure not only here in Turkey but globally because world leaders have started raising their voices about what happens\nTo a journalist and now that are rumors that there were other southeast delegations in town the same day that the gentleman was was the disappearing and ... among them were also some forensic personnel from ...\nYes as a pilot sorry to interrupt you but that's that was going to be my second point which is that even if Turkish officials are allowed to and it may be too late especially if those reports that one of the delegation was somehow a forensic scientist that could be that any evidence of what happened that's simply disappeared\nWell one thing about DNA it has a tendency to spread and Turkish investigators are quite good in finding out\nEvidence is if they ever any so\nQuite good in finding out evidence is if there ever any so no matter how

decision today was a victory for freedom of expression\nFreedom of expression includes both the right to express and a point of view\nBut also the right to not be forced to express or facilitated view with which you disagree so the up shot of today's ruling is the ashes cannot be legally forced to aid the promotion of same sex marriage by putting such a slogan on a cake\nBut it also means that gay bakers cannot be compelled by law to decorate cakes with slogans against gay marriage so we work both ways absolutely and it's got much wider implications and just gay rights\nSome here say president

Christian beliefs they are against same sex marriage but in this country in Britain as a whole\nAre well over half of people face support the rise of same sex couples to marry in civil ceremonies ... ashes are really out of step even with people or face a moreover\nWhat is very very difficult to me is um they are supporting in effect discrimination in law they sign a law should discriminate against gay couples by denying them the right to marry the person they love I've got to ask the question since when there's discrimination being a Christian value\nPizza ... human rights campaigner
