given by the powerful to the struggles of the powerless Donald Trump's support base is said to include the voices of America's white working class who believe they've been abandoned by traditional political candidates\nSo as the U. S. midterms approach to look at the identity politics have left and right and their impact on democracy on a panel this week in the studio with me hit Adrian ... professor of politics the University of Ken's\nNine or drive a novelist and journalist yes among lecture on government at Harvard University in Cambridge being bother Gopal a lecture at an English at Cambridge University welcome to you all I'd like to begin by asking each of you well sees identity politics what do you mean by it Priya\nEach of you will seize identity politics will do you mean by it Priya\nIdentity politics is I think out to my dad has been given and is used to describe\nClaims for civil rights claims to full citizenship and planes to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat ... which has been given to them on to equality and full citizenship and to social justice and I I'm not happy with the ... I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that have less to do with the identity of a sudden than with questions of justice\nWe can talk about that is a little bit more Adrian past what does it mean to you that politics is really about individualized I didn't see individuals with small groups very often focal minorities that's all right you all getting for quality and inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevated of a coma novelty that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities in in country so there's a problem I think in that it's a response individual lives and but I think it's an individualized response rather than a more communal collective response you\nKnow ... you know to me into politics his crops two very different phenomena that are going on to the same time it's a lot of confusion stems\nFrom mixing goes up so I'm the one hand what we're seeing at the moment is a lot of a minority groups claiming equality claiming riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nAs sort of movements but as Adrian just said I sort of trying to [noise]\nIt's sort of movements but as Adrian just said I sort of trying to re center the basis of liberal democracy from being about individuals to being ... about ... to ... elements of the state line of try to [noise]\nI think the term cohere as around the idea that we are defined by our power relationships and that who we are is primarily dictated by groups into which we were born in that way I regarded as anti individual for my own part\nJust about any group that I was born into female American what have you I Would like out of that is I find it confined and and my idea of what identity means\nA sizable number of people in the one hand and then you have lots of minority majority responses to that and I think none of his very healthy it's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you have any ethnicity or any gender and sexuality whatsoever that real victims they Israel oppression exploitation\nBut the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... ... what's that\nThat doesn't ask to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your passion was an offense against humanity many people would have some you know recognize the advance exactly in fact what the tea movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately want in ... exactly the same as what heterosexuals want and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but that is real discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit with them will justify it would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big sick\nA very nice movie which is owned by graphical about a Pakistani origin Americans than a comedian who falls enough with a white um how can we go into sort of dramatic life story they have no partners\nUm I was amazed by the way in which bed movie which tells in a mainstream romantic comedy a story of interracial marriage\nStarted to be attacked from the left\nFull marriage started to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't that problematic that this round protecting this has to find a wide why couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden you've got to be the right was saying\nWho cares if you find somebody who was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and it was possible left\nBut some of food for was problematic exercise leaving me\nIs the crux of disagreement about what society one because I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures Robin where everybody has to stay in the lane and avoid cultural appropriation on you to picture and in a movie of interracial relationships is probably my identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up I find some of the discussions off\nWhy can't we all get along like ... we all just share the same value is\nThe way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like a kind of cheesy a roll call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left\nAll my life who isn't for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheet about all falling in love and living happily ever after moving we caught stone politics into a kind of button all Hollywood wrong call\nNight all I Would for you and 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on the issue of they'll GB T rights and the way that's changed but feel free to come into ... well\nI think the what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and\nHas been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from which you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful is on a an an ordinary social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and uh you know if you're at a party\nAnd there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're\nPakistani but you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word\nMe might express something that's a little you know not all perfect\nThere's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful Adrian\nThe intolerance that line will just mentioned it's also political correctness on old pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow the differences defined as more than the not too close to a real difference is out there to be celebrated\nBut they also the coming out and she says how we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest I'm off even those notions of citizenship and humanity of calls contested there's no sense of of a consensus then they shouldn't\nOf citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus that shouldn't be warm but the memories simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's the way than to purchase has become\nSo the ... I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I sort of handwringing about authoritarianism and lack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example\nThe only example that was given was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo let me give you a couple of examples the first one I wanted to make clear but I think a black lives matter in many ways is an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to an understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states and I think there's one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that\nWhere disproportionate police violence against African Americans and the business or a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers is also true\nBut the majority of the people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the relatively small ... of the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to be a few cases if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is a particularly deepen justice\nBut you know what if you're a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually there's two white people who got shot by the police as well\nI ... one last quick question to you before we wrap up this high off ... people have never lived in monoculture moderate religious ... states this is new to the new situation that we find ourselves and why\nNew new situation that we find ourselves and why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's difficult and I guess his 'cause a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society and the middle of the function fiscal policies trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and Ken situations in the communities are not working and I think that's why people feel\nThis is a sense of powerlessness as a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with the center then Tuesday it's by definition exclusive\nBriefly Lionel I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier uh yeah ...\nWell it's like to disagree with premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world with founded on a more ethnic mono called hotel conception of themselves and find God who started the challenge that and we now live in society so much for most people embrace the idea of it the more to the snake societies but that is something you talked to quite new Korea\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth and one of the ways in which they're addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that\nWay by is minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called identity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering\nOkay pledged to think about that thank you for ... panel grandfather Gopal yes among ... and Adrian ...\nA panel grandfather Gopal yes among Lionel Shriver in Adrian pops we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think of the program or any ideas but topics you'd like us to look into you can email us the real story at BBC don't care what UK or treat me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll cost up\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

Massa and an India and everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not to watch the Persian Gulf in a rational utility maximizing preaches\nWe all people who live in ... we have people embedded in relationships institutions are not since feelings do methane is angel longing into place to people to communities and countries masses we kind of feeling out of politics I only got are the\nObvious question that footage from that has been loaning ... onto wet and ease parts of the reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing offensive on the longing that actually that that identity that was that the fool whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there are these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties\nAnd I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation in northern Irish politics\nThat's a boring observation and northern Irish politics but that's that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tribe than they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interest not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on Nick durable in some ways it was six\nYou'll neurons or a movie in India and you ah preach ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India\nIt wins bodes well one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as as a species break up into what are often very competitive\nClumps sorry I'm confused I\nThought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem but we've just been told that everybody wants to be tribal they caught identify with larger groups it's a natural tendency of people to especially when the larger amount gum\nIs just a bit too big to get your head around\nTo break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's all politics happens because those tribes are\nBut it but it's it is it politics happens because those tribes are bad but other tribes are okay I mean I'm very bad language singled out yeah I mean I think the\nQuestion is that I think clearly humans to have a natural instinct to care more about people who as close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes a village it might become a particular religious ethnic group and the question is how do we deal with this in ... to the society in a productive manage\nA one on such which I've personally as dogs have been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen you look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years and I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response\nIs to try and domestic hated behalf wild feast of nationalism to try and claim it fall as tiles to make it inclusive to say that either hire a collective\nUh it is I Love all of the kingdom of looking at it states up and obviously we fight for inclusion of all different groups under that common identity ... how do you make that journey from being a cousin pulled us in a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots\nI'm ... I think patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know adopt a side of history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots who love that country it's a question of mutual respect\nAnd like all the anxiety saying that\nAnd to play like hanging around so badly anxiety saying that you love found that it how do you enjoy it isn't that are going to talk what's wrong and loving your country and its people accuse people of identity politics but I'm saying your national Zuma view opposed to nationalism I imagine you are and you know I\nGuess I'm going to you're Josh from the ... thing making my country but for the majority\nIn a suburb of of Hindu majority of them so I look at nationalism that's something that had served its purpose in the anti colonial struggle but today has become a very deeply dangerous beast\nWhat is the writer response will be ... for it is the or the national Congress party but sad but we're all Indians respected\nMe that he's not he's not true like it's not as though the older a form of national lives in the Congress party didn't have ... elements to it the one\nThat we didn't know days of areas of angry as well at that age and if if I can bring you back then in a sense that there is a we we do seem to be making a distinction between bigger identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such gets as\nWell because I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more overarching can build a bridge you know we can be workers we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause it's found bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further the kind of cosmopolitan is my guest spoke about\nThat can doesn't have to uh can be a bit abstract I think the ... isn't that up so I think a lot of people feel European British or German or French but I also feel they have a little ... as a possible so that's a very simple\nFrench but I also feel they have a little club and see these layers of possible but that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we managed to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with it's great because you have people here and the answer is that if everybody identifies primarily with the national ...\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu and Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live together productively and peacefully whereas if we've had our sense of collective pride at the level\nWhich coincides with the actual ... cents doesn't everybody carry multiply and this was the last call on the edge of the English in between the identity is what she choose for yourself\nOn the ones that have foisted the of course we do in the uh people like ... like a Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way that I fight for the cause of\nPeople who have my identity is to emphasize oh common interest as Americans and other ... emphasize the ways in which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of the whole a member of the counter vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent\nAnd let's demonize any form of collective flowing above the level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a ...\nThat's a bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British nationalism that led to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on a painting by a sub nationalism that his English nationalism the way the Brexit vote\nBroke down there's a clear correlation between what you would call ... nationalism and British nationalism which led to breakfast and so again it's a you know I don't think we can have the kind of those things like that and without ended in ... in the wild\nWe can have the kind of interesting that ranks that they went out and didn't like I'd rather go to England and Wales exactly\nWhile I mean it it actually quite a lot of people in cars not did vote for breakfast I I personally am not expecting that majority ... right but but but I think what what you see here is different notions\nOf what an Asian might be my understanding of an inclusive nation is one that doesn't discriminate and I think there was some amount of than a phobia in the Brexit vote and secondly one that recognizes

however this cooling if the economy that we've been talking about\nThe escalating trade war between the U.S and China it is taking its toll on nights intensive slipping sound is ever in China [noise] yeah I think so and I think\nActually we have kind of lost to come actually even before the trade war tensions relieve on top of around the middle of the of the year we already saw signs that the Chinese economy was slowing and would slow father and there's there's indicators\nListed in place the gross\nOr in the economy activity and the economy will continue to go into next year before the stimulus the the the the authorities are currently undertaking and have you on the on the taking for several months now\nThe food that stimulus kicks in and starts to to push growth back up again in in the first half of next year but in the meantime you know you're you're you're right this this is taking a toll on\nA on the household sex around on on businesses but the households that the uh the the kind of the the pain has been combing hounded by this outbreak of swine flu as well\nWhen you say the hassle ... to intensive old ... people in China\nThe hassle ... to intensive old ... people in China that day to day lives when they have the likes all the ... from the U.S and he thought his escalating trade war\nHow does that affect that and how does the effect that investment decisions that pass no patches at that housing costs ... so the impact we saying that\nWell at this stage there isn't much of an impact in in the data from from the towers um because we haven't really seen a the the the the impact comes through in on the trade days to yet so we haven't we haven't really\nSeen it comes through on the on the price increases that you would expect as a as a as a result of these tariffs hikes but the thing that's really interesting at this stage is the last year we saw this critical shift in thinking of the of the Chinese\nAuthorities recognizing that they want to redirect reduces towards the households ... household can go out there and spend ... an power the economy and a part of that\nWas to say okay well we probably don't want to be taxing having these high import tariffs on on what it essentially will be consumer goods so since last year they've they've started on to take these these cuts in in Paris\nIt was like anywhere in the world I'm a I think most people when you visit another country whether that says a soldier or civilian you you're always push by the people you meet and for me the project was about children and helping them access to education and all three of these countries are incredible stories of humanity\nThat incredible people and it was an absolute pleasure to to kill me I was I felt so welcomed in all three of these countries in\nYou know all ... we we often hear from the western media that these are countries that we shouldn't go to that we should stay away from these too dangerous boy I can sit and they say that my experience that was as good as any holiday I've been on the west\n[laughter] now how does being a soldier um was served in Iraq and in Northern Ireland for the British forces how does a prepares you for running a modest than in places like I'm a country stunned Somalia Iraq\nThink that as a former soldier you know you ... the first thing is you used to operate in hostile environment so ... you're not naive to the tops the security risks and the dangers and as a soldier was well you're expected to be physically fit\nAnd you also have a you know originally in mindset you know you you know that that's going to be challenges and it's about how you money to deal with those challenges which which ultimately might as most than\nHaving traveled the world as a soldier ... most people it taught me to respect everybody regardless of whether they come from ... told me to respect that religion that culture and I think you know in all three of these countries I I did my best to\nUh to respect the people in in ... and the people respected me and I think that goes for anyway you go in the world if if you show respect you will get respect and you know those countries and no different when\nNext briefly ... next next year I'm going to be rowing dangerously or I'm going to be a sense in a will for ... but I'm going to row across the bottom end up strikes which is the gateway to the Gulf of

World Service\n[noise]\nTo rent an Hispanic but since\nThe beef scat that for being made illegal so my ... nice to join the gas [laughter] but uh yeah I think it's more about the presentation rather than actually ingredients because the ... states\nSuch as down to know wherever they would be to living off the own food that they would have grown and they would have had that room there on their own beef\nAnd their own dairy farms that are completely self sufficient so they actually within their own trend I mean very organic also I think has to be quite simple because after that could reach it do they\nEat it Oh yes oh they just having a good call them the experience\nI eat it Oh yes I think that to having it they're calling me experience\nFor you [laughter]\nKnow what to say if you have to make huge compromises the fate looking really good\nSo I yeah I think one of the things is when you're doing alone seen I think it shouldn't be\nThat it's such an issue in an act is kind of when he's putting his mouth it becomes something so I'm Glad that he's thinking of his lines and actually I Know it's nice that have to say myself they do seem to enjoy the food I\nSays how would you know [laughter]\nBut as the other thing I Try not to make it\nTo tasty because then we'd go the other issue that they may sort of at the end stop to eat too much and then I'm running out and that is a little bit of a nightmare as well as they come to mind the fine line\nDo you have to teach actors table manners\n[laughter] ... um some time is quite interesting\n... you know sort of really aware of how to use a knife and fork and it might be American actors who are faced with a sort of full most the tuition and actually sometimes it's delaying the table you know I've I've got to the gun rectify that occasionally\nYou've made or they say from the past you know these found some TV series you know even your kitchen looks like it's been incidents Dr active Downton Abbey has it changed the way as to what he didn't change the way you cook ... said I smoke\n... sort of ... to put things you know sort of flowers and to put things in ... and all these kind of very gentle subtle flavors of couldn't some fruit lies\n... couldn't and fruit lies you know that it's lovely actually have you ever had any rainy big disasters on that\nI did two mountain and all the Batman which was sort of I salute the huge\nSum up state law to kind of looks does and I did say that but this is not going to be great is going to be just a bit smelly\nThey went with it by the time and so um we just put lots of ... and ... candles so the whole thing smell had a rather kind of exotic smell [laughter] which I throw everybody rather confusing and that is that live with the old day for two seconds on the screen [laughter]\nTo me say he's type than accuracy is important but I knew when it comes to presentation so let's meet someone he takes food reenactment and little bit further for him looks are important but some of smells\n\nIn the kitchen further to the south of London three joined says the for being tens on a two and a half me ten don't spit in front of one of six rolling fall as this is Hampton coats the palace famously used by ... to King Henry the eighth and the sixteenth century to demonstrate his power and wealth\nOn any one day these kitchens may have set up to eight hundred meals to his ... he is of course that long ago now but someone still nice house of rice like a cheetah\nWe've gone on one side hair a dinner for the Miami servants children ... and if you hear it coming for that meal you'll say would consist of Fred ...\nAnd if you head coming for that meal you'll say would consist of friends and I do prefer unveil and that's all you get\nRich and rich is historic kitchens manager and sees life cooking demonstrations here he's telling if I wanted to take an inch what would be on a typical cheese and my little\nIf we're going to treat you are a little bit better than we might treat you to dinner last Henry the eighth would have done and if a crash\nWhich is a spice wind or cream of almonds um pheasants a fiction or shovel off one of those are those are all different types of the locks rabbits venison and paste taught for it to add fruits with powder is ... ...\nWhy are you doing this what do you think is the benefit of recreating food from the past the\nFood actually isn't that important the food is the lens to look at the cost for\nI mean it's a very easily understood vehicle we don't have any hurdle of sixteenth century politics all the reformation or which was what we talking about people want to know what is happening in the kitchen\nAnd not allow them to engage with the cost of a much more visceral on a much more rapid way than they can do anywhere else in buildings do people actually\nTastes any of this or what you're preparing ... no I Do not and one of the overarching comments we get from visitors is about the interaction that the team gives them the conversation the information\nOn the debt so fat and if they were catering disappears\nBecause the end product then becomes to type ... off of it\nSo no one has ever asked you why didn't you try and you know the blame on two hours of the language and people will pay for that call and you are that's anything no\nNow as a huge language and people will pay for that call and you are that's anything no\nNo we're saying we're reassuring the expensive as well as it would be an awful lot of work I'm simply because you have to understand that daunting stars company leads the way we ate\nLike folk swings Iran to mix a\nTaste that shouldn't go together and I'm often talent you have to explain that to people and I tend but rather damning or on a an enjoyable evening so old that lovely meat that trusting no one's going to eat it or it's divided into eight to pieces and there was a last resort stuff here with us\nAt the end of the day eight nine is drawing the most people get to take that that might be it would be me if I put my nine and but yeah I had more than enough may\n[laughter] ... so you know and actually tasting so we thought if we really wanted to do that how could we get\nI think it is absolutely impossible to recreate the taste of the past we've altered genetic stock cross breeding we've altered flavorings by changing the chemicals behind them and using different techniques to synthesize different taste\nThe atmosphere has changed that's absorbed by ... uh nutrients\nWe bred animals to remove the fat content probably be the only thing you can get the taste the same as war to if you could do for us to shift from the right to ... other than that\nIt's pretty certain that you can't get anything that tastes the same if however he said let's talk about making beef stew that has multiple ingredients and each of those has been all the time and so you have to work individually on each component\nAnd it's not worth it for at least [laughter]\nIndividual each component and it's not worth it for at least you\nKnow what I said for being stupid shit I've got to feeling my next guest would think it is [laughter] but before you need to a quick reminder you're listening to the\nFood chain on the BBC well ... with me and then he Thomas we've been meeting food reenactors\nPeople have a passionate about reconstructing the fates of the\nPast we've had about the importance of the parents of food in period dramas and the smell insights when we're trying to understand history ... no one's eaten anything but for our next guest taste is to Sarah\n... is a Canadian archaeologist nine for what recreating Raymond recipes using the archeological record from food remains\nTo grain males alongside written ... including ... guys coins and sculptures she told me an important part of a what is recording the sensory aspects of rain and cooking\nTheir flavor profiles were very very bold they used a lot of wind they produced a lot of wind in their cooking so there's a\nPungent flavors to some of their cooking they used a particular condiment called guarantee\nA fermented fish sauce it's like an assault component that they used to to flavor their food almost like an MSG but they would also use this type of sauce in their sweet says while they're in their desserts\nSo they had some very brave an unusual tastes but very exciting as well I mean it's it's different for us\nIn modern context but at the same time you can also look at it and see where we got some of our our tastes nowadays we can really\nBut at the same time you can also look at it and see where we got some of our our tastes nowadays we can relate to them when we see that taste mastered just as much to them as it does to us\nWhen I immerse myself in this process and essentially inserting myself into the interpret of process\nAs the missing human component to understand their connection to their food it's through smell it's a touch it's through site\nAnd it's the involvement of that preparation process that mattered so much to them because food was survival and food was what governed them food is what expanded the empire so studying Roman
