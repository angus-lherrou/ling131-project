to a statue of air off the Gulf of law not much they love about this place\nWe're off the gold of love there's not much to love about this place it's actually just really a traffic intersection around me there\nWas tons of traffic big buildings I don't know like the whole place to live up by these must've and that has been on the panel in front of me of course only for lice and movement takes energy and the phone today from banning fossil fuels like oil and gas\nEarlier this week deans governmental panel on climate change came out with its latest report and we'll be hearing from one of the office and moving\nIt's actually the report said we can't go on like that and if we do we're going to dangerous the stabilize the F climate\nCities cars and buses and everything else around me is going to need to be powered by renewable but he's not possible what's that going to do to the economy and can we have the kind of Bruce we've got used to oh well we have to get used to something else maybe something less dynamic\nMore does that mean the politics cannot lead is the sweet ... to make a big sacrifice that well there is a pretty tough questions that but that's get back to the studio now me sad paddle\nA tunnel is Laura Diaz on a dumb professor of climate change policy at Cambridge University ... he's the policy director at the Grantham instituted climate change at the London School of economics Julius ... he's an associate professor of an ecological economics at Leeds University\nI'm Molly Scott ... a member of the European Parliament\nFor the u._k. green policy\nThank you for joining us before we begin I Want to introduce one more pests than a nuts you rebel he's one of the authors of this week's PCC reports and he's\nNow he's one of the office of this week's IPC seat would pose and he's with me here in Studio ... you read the report calls for the well to aim to keep rising label temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to comment to price is the wilds on track to me or anything like that target festival\nWent to clarify that the report doesn't call for anything the report also is a question that the governments have asked the IPC\nIn two thousand Fifteen in the Paris Agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warming to one point five and now this report clearly shows that there is a important difference between warming if one point five\nAnd two degree and also shows demeans into raising rich global warming can be limited to that level\nAnd say just to be clear is the well them try to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to rule is knock on track currently the pledges of the countries that they have submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions overtime and two twenty thirty whereabouts in mission should be decreasing very very steeply or by twenty thirty\nSo paint a picture of Warsaw the consequences if temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for\nExample for coral reefs are two degrees of warming we don't see any scientific evidence that they will ever survive at one point five degrees of warming it it's still possible that some of them survive also for four to ... ecosystems there is a redo\nAlso for for ... ecosystems there is a really clear shift in the impact on forests and other systems and finally also for humans the difference between one point five and to a degree of forming is about more than four hundred million people that are more affected by heat waves\nEverybody but clearly people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that they're actually putting things and you know five\nFlying is one of the most environmentally damaging DVDs one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that to people especially at the same fall we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable lives how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible uh Simon I'm American my nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the ... and climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards and the life of deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker\nA more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly because you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are often outside the city center is so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies so that people have better quality ... they don't spend as much time\nSo that people have better quality large they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design a world but whose birth lowering our missions and one in which people living ...\nLouis is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some ... and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing\nFrom from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to seven and ten but some people were saying that these in these um these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term costs nothing equate long term\nCleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increase of seeing an extra seat the price of things that you can get another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people for a larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no losers what we can say that\nThese losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor these short term losses but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of garments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies\nI Will give you the other is simple we also know that the fossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training and we've\nUh emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing it may be the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost\nBe better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get these short\nTerm ... case I if I can just bring you back from a ... year he was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier round you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the television with a massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement although I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the parents agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work on the sustainable finance area we can say the ... financial products or pension products have to be aligned with a one point five\nParis target for example I can see that and I was in the parliament and not gain support for that were previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and I imagine a world that is climate change the climate is breaking down and\nThey see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not you\nKnow it was just want to work to do that when asking the question who is going to pay for this won't ... should not see this as a ...\nTo pay to for this won't really should not see this as a luxury something that we do know because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one\nThis is reading an investment in a safer and sustainable growth and when asking the question was going to\nPay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question what was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already we can observe them today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree of warming\nAnd ... to a degree of forming this is not in the far future this is um one point five at current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degree yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for that\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing manage so that they she the poor of the impact of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and enter into real welfare\nLaurie wants to come back and yeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do I guess made a lot has been done we have a nine to nine countries with when you have all the entire Seventy three countries with auctions fifty eight countries that are the how the other places to see that when you both and\nThanks to all these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mitigation coming down significantly\nSo this is making it easier to reason to label called them price for instance\nThere's a great no they do is that what we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution I couldn't economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next election\nWhat we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have to realize there's been um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which have traditionally been\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications unconscious indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's these investments ... it is changing and that's the only said\nAgain we are doing and we have been doing it it's not enough ah as they say the report is reminding us okay um but I Do think this point at he's made all the report about\nMaking sure that the most vulnerable or not heard is not just necessary for ethical reasons but he's also necessary for political reasons because only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYou know so when we talk about coffee is important but we remember the global economy is not stuff that you can there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent but when he says to him down to zero by twenty fifty so over the period\nIn the next between two thousand uh Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double\nNinety truly and we'll be invested in New infrastructure infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we make the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it's sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years we grow at a rate of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next forty years they all trends in the global economy\nIn the next forty years they aren't trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive or we design our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing a\nTo make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast now thank you to our panel throughout the as an adult ... case had\nAn you

World Service here on key\nOur [noise]\nYou're on key when our [noise] our broadcasts made possible by a generous grant from the EL cord foundation in memory of EL cord pioneer radio broadcaster\nSo wouldn't come evil and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he ... think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make kept Mondays I PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an him in a crisis because that's their charge from the United nation just level but\nI mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would be swayed the administration that it needs to take this more seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are a pretty convinced that a pro energy\nPeople are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda [noise]\nMyron ... talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't as battle lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and it uses science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on the science what they do have a view as they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nFull board wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government has signed up to\n[noise] so how ... how do you decide gate and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states to shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo innocence what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you go to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives his reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheaper to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut he's in the ... the facts of becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including coal mining industries and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs he's\nPart of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is big up because it's sea level rise and as a good chance that the warmer than average waters in the Gulf well partly puma because of climate change I think people say it's an increasing costs to bearing the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the Trump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the u._s. hasn't gone we this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies\nThis has been in the support for innovation low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years in a row try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to see her all at the route investments that three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nIn low carbon energy technologies but Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas these idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the first world the very developed well let's see if we may\n... to ... that a growing I won't speak to treat the group though he's a professor of environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joins us today from Cairo's streets I won't talk about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that is growing\nFast but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly seriously just described with some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it's\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda is much more to talk about renewables but at the same time they just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother\nOf gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection and I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in health\nAnd so uh that itself could be a reason for taking action on a bus with you and doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments have argued that a country that's growing is simply not positive\nWasn't part of the industrialization prices that if you like caused the problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beaded Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five\nAt that time the developing countries are doing the north must take action cyst no it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways\nTo buy bonds the mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the north tried to convince a bench and funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nAnd funds to stop investing in fossil fuels but the question is what are the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels\nThe investments to the south and I find it very good idea to shift and the problem effect right and so I Do developing country should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you think for a country like India that democratic that this is\nMore difficult or easier to push through as an idea [noise]\nThe problem with democracy is of course is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to this is science relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other\nHand I think that there's a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd I really think that if he can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains and that's really going to lead to major challenges the mountains stock to melt the snow starts to them as in the mountains\nAnd so as a consequence if you just try to look at the agricultural sector in India the postal sect in India\nThey were really suffer and there's a strong reason to take their views into account and\nTry to read visit our energy storyline\n... soon there's a big reasons for India to make changes similarly big reasons for China to make changes do you think China may ultimately find it easier to make those changes because it's not democratic\nChina's been going for sort of both and strategy of growing all energy times at once\nChina's been going for a sort of both and strategy of growing all energy time said once but I think any kind of well run country any kind of country that has a government that cares about its population will in fact be pushed by that population at population as well informed enough about the risks that are coming down the line and are very near future\nHello and welcome stays there on the BBC well Savage with Connie shopping on because they just good to have you with us [noise]\nThe president

admissions that that could be more diplomatic bumps and bruises along the way as he tries to persuade Kim Jong un to give up his nuclear weapons are correspondence Laura ... to the interview\nWhen it comes to have knowledge of war president moon is the son of North Korean refugees so one of the first questions I asked him was was this more personal than political for him\nAnd he said that he does understand the pain of war this declaration of war I you know as I said his parents fled North Korean Nineteen fifty three they never sell their family again and he said one of the reasons why he wants to be president of South Korea was to help prevent war returning to the peninsula\nAnd for those who listen to ... to Advil knew that the the fighting here on the Korean Peninsula ended in Nineteen fifty three with an armistice never a peace treaty\nAnd now both north and South Korea would like to see some kind of end of war declaration and so that they can work towards the peace treaty but to do that they need to not the United states\nAnd the U.S is unwilling to do so until North Korea makes real concrete steps to disarm and give away the nuclear weapons\nThat came out in the middle here to try to mediate between at the U.S and North Korea has been at president Moon Jae in\nAnd he has had three summit with Kim Jong un this year and he says that Kim Jong un is committed to complete denuclearization and that he understands that that means dismantling his current nuclear arsenal\nThat Kim Jong un is committed to complete denuclearization and that he understands that that means dismantling his current nuclear arsenal bought president made admitted that he hadn't talked about how that process would work in detail or look at the time table but he hoped\nThat would be looked at the next United States North Korean summit which could be quite soon\nAlso Laura he's heading to Europe this or that this coming week of the ... and really interesting he says that they will be bumps and bruises along the way but he hopes European leaders will help to mediate between Kim Jong un and Donald Trump is negotiations stole\nI mean in the past a European leaders have kind of look to the ... approach with North Korea yes they are quite and\nSupport or they certainly support the United states approach current United States' approach will maximum pressure they've been finding out for that but in the past they have looked to kind of more carrot and stick approach is so incentives to North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and he may be looking for president men certainly has is seems to be traveling to Europe with the hope\nThat European leaders can help him mediate between the United states and North Korea to find the allies in his path towards peace and I think that's one of the reasons and that he's heading to Europe and the next week\nAnd how is he being judged so far by the people of South Korea\nThe overwhelming factor has been his relationship with North Korea and has a developing of peace remember he came to power last year\nAnd just as the war of words between Donald Trump and Kim Jong un were at their worst I mean this time last year at North Korea had carried to stick successful nuclear test on those ... threatened to resign fire and fury in Pyongyang and many\nTom Petty threatened to resign fire and fury and killing young in many feared that the Korean Peninsula was once again on the brink of war so he has been seen as somebody he has been pushing for peace in his poll numbers do grow up after any summit with Kim Jong un\nNo more they have actually taken that one site and said we'll have to wait until the markets settle down a little bit ... thank you\nUsed it from the BBC ... because he can come to shop for your lives ... better to do with questions are being asked about how an American Ron Charles you sit up to provide an education for girls ended up being a place where a number of them or sexually abused as that\nYeah the more than me educational channels he was founded by an American wedding cakes\nMore than me educational Cherokee was founded by an American wedding cakes ... who reads millions of dollars and it was even gone to a building or by the then President Johnson Sirleaf by twenty fourteen however a number of guns had come forward and edging they had been raped id organizations main coordinated Macintosh jumps and\nHe went to prison and later died of aids but the fact that the charity will still able to operate\nUnreasonable funds despite do scandal on good people in Liberia now one month to up the story in a year long investigation on Tuesday was really young he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by pro public uh and time magazine\nSo the organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called West Point when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier\nIt was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and he was the one who was on the ground selecting girls often and managing scholarship program\nBut sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students according\nTo their statements the police had been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten when the ... began and than girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names are given to staff of the time as many as thirty according to an internal charge talking\nYou know how many girls will actually raped in number\nGirls testified in court against Macintosh on one of the interesting things about it is that there was never a negative repercussions there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that that the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in his care so when the rates came to light the organization essentially said\nThat this was a community issue according to our investigation to minimize the role of the man who had been a central\nAnd as a nation essentially said that this was a community issue\nAccording to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central mind into organizations who died an intimate relationship with the find or they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they had empowered him ... said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own operating cultures in a challenging context may have contributed\nTo his ability to access and abused young girl they mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in how would you do and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be raped will actually infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so\nWhat we know is it to students who are named dozens victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so so very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization really failed to confront and a meaningful way\nSo what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continued to operate to the generally there'll be many changes uh told to make it hard to fool the vulnerable goes to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place is certainly true that the organization sought to to strengthen its policies and sought to improve its hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time\nTwo girls were the first time according to their statements that at\nLeast so definitely the organization tightened up policies but almost immediately after the rates came to light the organization ended up with the rising international prominence in six months afterwards because of course the Ebola outbreak Liberia at that time subsequently Katie ... who's the head of the organization was named attain person with a year within six months that these rapes in her organization coming to light up\n[noise] and that was journalist um you just feel young speaking to

I think is on the scale of the problem will die\nDefinitely a sense um that it it is increasing\nThe exposure to wasted in culture is something that seems to influence the likelihood of one developing an eating disorder\nWe seeing especially in the younger population who live in the ... it's an area is going to mix schools that are linked to associated eating disorders thinking so a lot of concern around rates in shape losing weight\nA visiting the ... so that within the culture influence is\nEquipped sides so that waste and culture influence is seeming to to be one of the biggest contributors and the prevalence of eating disorders in like in the black population but teaching\nDisorders on just about being saying all by some of the people respecting to on this program has been rainy came to emphasize that that is not well trained and everything to soda\nYeah so it's not just about being send us different elements a lot of patients will talk about different things around trying to control what feels ... like a very chaotic outside world\nBeing able to live independently without other relationships because people disappoint you and hurt you so there's different sort of narratives behind what away the eating disorder might have stemmed from but I think different if he the pro sin pro\nUm fitness kind of message that's communicated can tend to exist debate those already existing problems so I think that's the one factor that has been researched unfortunately there's not a lot of resurgence of Africa and eating disorders [noise]\nFull and LA westernized nation is a major factor in the rise of eating disorders amongst the population [noise] but some doctors are wary of putting too much emphasis on incidents from the west when we talk about eating disorders in Africa [noise]\nI really feel that when you talk about ... I think developing countries sometimes the attitudes that are held\nBy the rest of the world is that they are not able to\nFully accept\nOr see someone even from a rural part of an African country or\nFrom a rural part of an African country or just anyone from that part of the world as a fully hole and complex human being this\nIs an assault G. I. K. K. but ... in New York based Nigerian American ... he just public awareness lack in Nigeria [noise] she told me as being ... meeting to soldiers in the country and public awareness is alive\nThe response that you may get from the general public from some people they may say I don't understand what is going on what do you mean you don't want to eat\nThere are people that actually don't have food to eat and you're saying that there is food available but you just don't want to eat they don't really want to acknowledge that there is some components\nOf a mental health issue oh\nWhy is that why is that is typically around mental health\nYour deems somewhat of a pariah from the rest of society\nSome people will say any abnormal or strange behavior that they made note or deem strange or normal\nIs basically spiritually induced all you need is prayer all you need is\nSome sort of spiritual intervention or cleansing so not many people really want to talk about it and not many people really are able to get the amount of help that they really need when they are facing any kind of mental health issue and how\nWorried telling you about the lack of resources the people in Nigeria hit of suffering with eating disorders\nI'm extremely worried I feel that sometimes it takes one being on the brink of death before somebody actually takes a problem seriously and at that point\nSeriously and at that point it may just be too late [noise]\n\nA quick reminder you're listening to the food chain on the BBC wild Saturdays with me and then he told us this week I'm hearing about the experiences of black women have had eating disorders and why the prevailing stereotype that only white west and women who suffer is so harmful\nI've just been speaking to sell cheap adult he's been explaining how some aspects of Nigerian couch might make people's I'm are built in eating disorders I wondered whether someone have suffered from the illness which agreed with having out of this\nSo I spoke to a lot of equipment and the Nigerian astray turn block I he suffered from ... from the age of eleven\nNatures of society where um she pulled aren't refrain from commenting on other people's bodies\nUm even with little children um especially with all girls aren't exempt from these kinds of envious of comments about their bodies um and you got them not just from the appearance but you also got him from adults especially from grown men\nAnd um it made me very uncomfortable thing would they say men with these things like um you know you ... ... which is like basically you're developing a bomb\nAnd then also women they would say things like covered this or your bum is too much or you're developing breath and like they'd actually be totally pincher bomb\nDeveloping breath and like they'd actually be totally pincher bomb they gave you the impression that your body was inserting itself into the public view and then it was your juicy to to hide it\nAnd then not just stop but then they transmit very vicious comments about people's weight as well so if you're ... your cold or a ball and if you're thin like they call you won't get fish and like they make all sorts of like horrible comments about you [noise] um so that was really where like the eating disorder starts it\nAnd we'll say anything else going on you at that time that may make you particularly vulnerable do you think\nSo several times um you know I had a um I some situations where either I had to physically got away from someone who was trying to assault me or there was a lot of inappropriate um behavior towards me by\nOlder men or older boys I'm so that kind of compounded this idea in my mind that my body was a problem and it needed to be controlled because clearly it was attracting all these harmful people towards me\nAnd I think a lot of um young nature and girls and like probably even boys go through the same thing because there isn't very much records for people who you know had been molested and it's usually in the new age I thought they brought it on themselves\nI'm so because of that people really learn to self censor in a way and one of the things that you can do is like you know to shrink yourself into to make yourself less of this\nDo is like you know to shrink yourself and to to make yourself less visible on one of the ways of doing this to start starving or so\nBut more than a told me this can be hot today in a Nigerian family\nThere's too many people and the average Nigerian household who can observe that you're not a fan who can report and like that will be dealt with the media can be so I Would eat and then later on I Would throw it up\nAnd that kind of kept ... a closely guarded secret people wouldn't have understood she told me eating disorders in Nigeria and be seen as frivolous\nGlobally the average white woman is welfare than the average black woman so even one block people have eating disorders it's seen as or will be fought so many other problems\nThat require our attention or money we don't really have time for this but we don't really have the resources to address this that's why it's being asked or the white woman's problem because I think the insinuation as well white people have the resources to address like a problem a trivial us\nComing up after the news on the b._b._c.

G inside that comes to that building\nWealth David if if the reports are true and there's a lot of coming out of turkey this morning as you've seen 'em this would be murder it'd be murder by the government of Saudi Arabia against one of its citizens\nMr could show he is also a permanent resident of the United states of the state of Virginia He's a columnist for one of our most prominent newspapers the Washington Post\nSo from an American perspective there's a direct interest of the United states government in trying to pressure the Saudi Government to tell the truth of what happened\nThat denials by the Saudi ambassador to the United states cannot be believed at this point and the Saudi Government has not offered any convincing evidence as to what happened\nAnd so I think that pressure from all world leaders including from the Turkish president has to continue on the Saudi Government\nIt your reading of what you've seen and Donald Trump as it is one has tweeted about it and a secular state Pompeo was talked about it too is it your reading of these reactions from Washington that the U.S government is indeed applying\nIan especially when second changes I've taken away from the country when you can't do that I wouldn't call that tree fault\nLet's return Nick buttons if we made to NBS himself and it is important again to think from Washington's point of view that for a long time indeed the years that you are a very senior figure in the state department\nThere was deep concern about the degree to which Saudi Arabia was exporting a a ... hobby religious ideology which was\nEncouraging dangerous extremism and many other parts of the world was Saudi resources were being invested in mosques and ma dresses and what have you\nAnd NBS addressed all of this and he said the Bloomberg just a few months ago he said look we are trying to get rid of extremism and terrorism without a civil war in our country without stopping the country from growing and with continuous progress in old elements\nAnd he asked you said with regard to human rights if there was a small price to\nPay in that area it's better than ... paying a very big dent to make that move now\nSurely in Washington there is still residual sympathy with that sentiment\nWell you know the Saudis have always had a great deal of support in Washington because the Saudis have been in the vanguard of trying to contain Iranian power that's been a priority for the United states going back to the late Nineteen seventies so the Iranian Revolution\nThe Saudis more recently under

parties will be in rebellion against the Saudis you'll see criticism you've not seen before you may even see an end to the American arms provisions to the Saudis on Yemen which I think would be the right move\nAre interesting you say that I was just looking this morning at the figures\nIn the last year the American arms exports to Saudi Arabia with some Eighteen billion\nDollars Saudi Arabia I think takes more arms and virtually any other country in the world from the United states that represent twenty percent of all us ... walls and sixty percent of Saudi arms imports that relationship\nIs so important to both sides that I Am skeptical as to whether you believe\nThat the Congress for example is now going to ask really difficult questions of Saudi Arabia is really going to happen\nWell you know we're not going to end our relationship the United states with the Saudi Government because there is so much riding on the containment ever on but I Do think two things may happen one is you might see I think you should\nBut I Do think two things may happen one is you might see I think you should see if this sorted drama continues if there are no answers for ... that are convincing unprecedented criticism by the United states against the Saudi authorities number one and that cannot be that's going to be a problem for mom of insolvent\nBecause as you know uh there's a lot of controversy within Saudi Arabia bought his rule about whether or not he's actually strengthening\nA Saudi influence around the world or a week and yet that's the first thing that could happen second there are many members of Congress who are disturbed\nBy the use of American weapons by the Saudi authorities in Yemen that have been directed a into civilian areas it's been a tremendous loss

officials in the country\nYes absolutely and and the national guard was in charge of protecting their oil household and the art installations\nBut if I'm at the sentiment is secured and his position he wouldn't really result to these kinds of erratic acts the war in Yemen it's been going on for almost like four years and we have seen no end to the bombing using west and a ministry equipment\nAnd also expertise let's not forget there are people from the United states and from the ministry in Britain on the ground in Saudi Arabia and we have heard that without us and you can support this war in Yemen would not continue for\nMore than ... because the Saudi Government continues to frame by war in the way the context of a struggle within the region within the middle east between Saudi Arabia and its allies and the Iranians\nA framework which frankly games a lot of traction in Washington and otherwise why they continue to be able to prosecute this war what\nUnfortunately that Saudi Arabia is seen as the shield against Iraq in fact at Iran yes it has intervened in Arab countries it hasn't been a show on the ground it has supported as groups in Lebanon and Iraq and Syria and elsewhere but the argument that we can tolerate it\nBut the argument that we can tolerate added pressing regime that has actually gone out of its way to kidnap prime minister prime minister of Lebanon and puts him under house arrest forced him to resign just this that bin Laden yet another country in the mid eighties\nAnd president that's probably another integration and ... and a few gene crisis to go that far with that actually the U.S the main protector of the Saudi monarchy putting as certain conditions on it's on equivocal unconditional support is unbelievable\nWe have to end in a moment Nicholas Burns I'm going to turn it back to you you've talked about the strategic importance of Saudi Arabia if we look at it on one level today we see a young Roula let's call them the ruler of the country NBS who's just thirty three years old he controls\nPretty much all leave us a power as far as we can tell and Saudi Arabia remains a boss the wealthy oil rich nation which masses ... many other\nTo the the strategic balance\nIn the middle east it is very hard to imagine the United states wants to see old prompt instability in Saudi Arabia\nThe last thing the United states would want to see and I think the rest of the world certainly the Arab world will be instability in Saudi Arabia Steve I think we're looking at\nAlmost the Shakespearian drama here you can see the promise of reform and the acts of reform\nOr by the Saudi crown prince that will take Saudi Arabia forward and then you see a dark side you see the paranoia you see the sense of vengeance you see this unbelievable violence inside the country and the rest of Saudi citizens and the exile of other Saudis\nAnd and it's really unclear how this is all going to turn out\nExile of other Saturdays and and it's really unclear how this is all going to turn out which way well this young man turned but certainly the show he event if it's true that he was murdered um this is going to be a watershed moment inside Saudi Arabia and

watershed\nMoment not under the leadership of ... I I've lost hope that that is called for reform in Saudi Arabia simply because we've heard the story of reform for several decades and that the more reforms in the morning stays the same and in fact we are seeing what scenarios\nBut we are a sheet here in London and the bones in California I think you both very much for being on hold to thank you\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

rooted Mondays\nStory argues is a sign of a mood deep rooted Monday's\nBasically since the rates crisis you've seen trust in the media in the most important institutions that go up the economy you've seen trust collapse\nTheir various reasons for that plainly the single most important one is the sense that the crisis was Bruce on us by the political and financial establishment and that the way in which was resolved\nWas unfair many people were left behind in those responsible was punished as quickly so you have that's basic sense that everybody's\nIn it for themselves anyway a sort of numbing belief that nobody is behaving well anyway\nAnd then very specifically and perhaps why this particular\nStory consenting Donald Trump has had a little impact as it has there is a loss of trust in Egypt and an unprepared this to believe actual empirical fact lots of that possibly does come from the rise of social media but there is\nA sense now that there is no particular reason to believe the established means ... that in some ways it's almost paternalistic to think that somebody like the New York times during the huge investigation is more to be trusted than anybody else that's I think he's a big sperm\nYou experience at the time didn't you when the moon brothers collapsed is actually that was a light bulb moment for you and that's something you've written about in your swan song for the tea\nYes I had this extraordinary experience while I was in New York covering the crisis two blocks away from the ...\nI was in New York covering the crisis two blocks away from the ... it was very very exciting time by coincidence I happened to have a lot of money just landed in my city bank account because I just sold in apartments in London I went to the bank to try to move money around to make sure that I didn't have money left in uninsured deposits\nAnd once I discovered was that many people from the wall Street's offices around me were doing the same thing that they were moving money around accounts to make sure that they have this much money as possible protected by the government's into positive insurance and the place was full of people in\nSmart suits trying to shuffle them on the grounds protected\nNow that looked like a ... technically wasn't they weren't actually taking their money out at the ... but it looks like a bank run\nAnd if we had tried publicizing this it would have been a very scary moments at the time all I was thinking was if we publicize an image like this then we're going to get in trouble because this is going to look irresponsible it's going to look as though we're\nIn fighting panic ... basically inciting a bank run yes exactly which is one of the things you've got to be very careful in the financial ... any bank even if it's very well run can you get into trouble if there is a lot of confidence in that you've got to be really really sure of\nWhat you're doing before you see that there's a bank run that just because you didn't report it at the time I\nDid not report that the climate didn't particularly serious take that to me to say and ten years on because we've had the anniversary of the crisis I thought it would be an interesting anecdote to talk about and I was ... by the ... level of invective and the anger this arose the opinion\nThe anger vis erodes the opinion against them as least false one five to one against very powerful sense that the mainstream media can't be trusted if they're not going to tell us the whole truth\nSo people sort of you with holding crucial information that they should have had access to if you being in that ride a responsible report\nYes precisely so the idea of the traditional media sources like the F team where I was at the time of the new science acting as a responsible filter of being your reliable source that you can go to for information is as a base at this point I think if this were to happen again ten years on\nIowa somebody else would have seen what was going on taking a furniture and it would have been out there on social media I'm ... now regarded as ... as a baseline of acceptable behavior\nSince not just the two thousand ... financial crisis so social media that is created this lack of trust and\nPrecisely that was a loss of belief in the financial establishment combines with the loss of belief in conventional media these days information gathering is tribal people read the information they're interested in there and\nRead from sources they don't care about and when you put the two together what you find is that if a\nAnd wonderful traditional news source does a great piece of investigative reporting it can still chiefly be dismissed because there is a sense that everything's through the financial world is corrupt anyway and you don't need to trust traditional means you to tell you things are kind of makes you wonder what\nTrust traditional means you to tell you things it kinda makes you wonder what would it take to budge someone's opinion on President Trump I mean is something as big as a serious allegation in a big global Iraqi might be a lot in New York Times saying a sitting president is effectively\nA tax cheats that the implication of the newspaper whatever denials era\nIf that makes no impact well would\nI find it very hard to imagine there's I mean he made the famous comments about shooting somebody in Fifth Avenue and people would still vote for him he was kind of right yes it's hard to see ... which change opinion at this moment given that opinion is so polarized and people derive their information\nFrom particular associates I remember I sense out of tweets Donald Trump is delighted to tell everybody I wanted to play stock market performances so it turns out streets simply comparing how he had done compared to under Obama and Clinton and it's done better on drone grammar and renting them under Trump [noise]\nAnd I go to a bunch of replies say where did you get that from was that from MSNBC\nWhich is the most liberal cable news channel here and see an sorry I mean like ... yes yes so you can send a basic straightforward factual information about how much stock markets as reasons and it will still be treated as I ... you go that's from somebody liberal\nBecause there is so much talk about post factual world but it also suggestive of the sort of nearly as and\nYes it's very difficult to talk about this in ways that are very very negative there is a lack of trust and without trust it's very difficult for society to functions very difficult for finance ... and there was a lack of preparedness to believe anything that you don't\nAnd there was a lack of prepared was to believe anything that you don't really believe also trust others to work in all of U.S interests it's very dangerous\nJohn ... of Bloomberg of course the real test for President Trump will come in November when the U.S holds midterm elections\nBut while there'd be no immediate political repercussions since the New York times published its allegations against him earlier this month\nThe New York state tax department has because of it is looking into the claims and New York city officials have said they've joined investigation to ... is a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush the\nIssue is that this is a state and local level investigation and the president has no power to pardon at state and local level it's the New York state attorney general and the Manhattan prosecutor her going after the Trump entities in New York and at that level he cannot do anything\nSo if he really is facing a serious investigation there he's going to need cash\nAnd so that's why I think there's a very good chance that he won't run again because what he really needs and wants to do is to launch what they're calling T. N. N. which has the Trump produced network to take on C. N. N. and I wonder you know is this why he's meeting with Kanye and you can see him beginning has set the stage as it were\nAnd he's going to say look I Won the prize I did everything that I needed to do the net done then there done that and I mean I have a much bigger more huge platform as he says which I think he'll be right about because\nActually having that kind of a media platform will be more powerful than the White House where he has genuine constraints\nBut if he's doing his own\nWhen constraints but if he's doing his own news network and that's what's in the pipeline for him I mean if Fox News is on his side he's ... but you know he'll do everything from reality t._v. too political talk shows and\nIt will be outrageous as you can imagine but I think the key thing is the world of journalism is paying so much attention to the Mueller investigation which is actually yielded relatively little\nOr no attention to the state and local investigations which are much more serious threats New York state penitentiary is not a joke I mean is it or not white collar prisons so that threat is a very real thing\nAnd as you say these state investigation wreck he has no say of a state if it was a federal investigation he's apart and ... is a federal investigation black so in a way he needs to worry less about that and worry more about\nThe tax investigate oh I think ... that is right\nAnd I think it's also very interesting one of the things that Brett Kavanaugh had specialized in was the fact that the president can pardon almost anything at the federal level and now he's on the Supreme Court okay so now we know this is the situation but state\nAs a whole different thing\nThat the ... the Trump news network I stick with the dependable BBC but then I Would say that from me

relation\nTension remember this is the case that has led us turkey relations to plummet\nI'm Donald Trump lost patience with the fact that he was still intention here over the summer two years after he was initially locked up that led to sanctions on two Turkish ministers and um the White House announcing a trade tariffs on steel not a million would be doubled\nEncore reciprocated and so a U.S relations plummeted and with it\nThe Turkish lira that's lost forty percent of its value against the dollar this year so if he is a released there is an expectation that the relationship would recover

updates there's no counting the millions of lives saved by the discovery of antibiotics and the use of the twentieth century\nWill the twenty first to see the end of the effectiveness one of the reasons might be the widespread use of besides which is adding to the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria\nThat's according to new research by scientists in New Zealand and I spoke to one of them he is professor jak hind them and from the University of cancer brand new Zealand well the most of the connection between herbicides designed to kill weeds and antibiotic resistance\nPrize that are all of that is that as you say\nKilled weeds an antibiotic resistance\nLeaf surprising all all of that is is that as you say we expect herbicides to kill plants and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria but\nThe chemistry of these different kinds of of agents and drunks are such that bacteria perceived both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the kind of bacteria that we study but the bacteria I don't know this and they react to them as if they weren't good toxins\nBecause these are or toxins because herbicides or poor toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you get a sub lethal effect\nBacterium ... respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for pumps that remove all those toxins from inside themselves to outside\nThat pre adapt the bacteria for exposures to toxins that are much more potent like antibiotics so the herbicides in a sense are vaccinating the bacteria against the antibiotics\nAnd this is happening this protest is underway and the most harmless of sounding places anyway told the Bronx looms where people play with the dogs\nThat's right wherever herbicides and antibiotics may come together and they come together in these places because for example you might use herbicides on your lawn\nYour cat uh or your neighbor's cat might walk through your lawn walk back into someone's house where they're stroked that puts her side and application levels on their hands and they may touched their mouths\nIf there are also on antibiotics or if the taxes on antibiotics we now have a combination of herbicide an antibiotic in this latest study\nWe found that that particular combination when herbicides and antibiotics come together\nIn this latest study we found that that particular combination when herbicides and antibiotics come together the development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done professor\nWell first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of all the different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria these sub lethal effects on bacteria presently were unaware of any regulatory process in the world that asks these kinds of questions\nWhat would happen when these bacteria are exposed to some leads a levels of chemicals that are people are routinely using either and work or at home\nThen once we have some sense of what kinds of combinations of chemicals could induce antibiotic resistance that could inform us into possibly revising what we think of as appropriate use of the these different kinds of manufacturing chemical\nCan you imagine a post antibiotic era\nI can imagine it but it's not a very very pleasant image\nThe post antibiotic era will be like pre antibiotic era except we won't have the hope of new antibiotics so we have to be very very careful with the antibiotics we have now and the fuel yet to be discovered so that they continue to be useful to us in the future\nProfessor jak kind them in more than a million people were killed during eight years of fighting between Iran and Iraq a war that ended so to use that go not to say about reports now on
