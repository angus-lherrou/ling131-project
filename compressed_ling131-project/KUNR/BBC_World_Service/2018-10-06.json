I Would call them digital bread crumbs but also some physical evidence that would then\nAh basically lead to what happened yesterday and I have to say like you know like the uh these uh spies ... an ape\nLike you know like the a nice as spies with call in April and only had about a a D.C yesterday so it shows you know that there's a lot of ah coordination between these governments going on behind the scenes that we don't know about\nPatricia I'm just on a purely practical level um\nIt seems to me that there there it is a kind of terrorism and what it is it seems to be doing is seeping into our everyday lives ... since we don't know if I say spoken or written been infiltrated we've seen really what looked like clumsy attempts that that have been really quite effective and\nTo me what an certainly as a storyteller it's interesting to me that the the narrative of Russia seems to be almost more powerful than Russia itself I mean\nIs there activity about building a kind of virtual Russia in people's minds\nYou think well I think of course like you know a ... in a way what happened yesterday wasn't about us and by the same time if you look at it from the Russians perspective having all these governments coming together rice and accusing Russia that also puts Russia and the\nAnd the way in a good place like you know that managed to get like the guy that all these governments and to have all these like press conferences ago across the globe I guess obviously like that does put them in a good place by the end of the day or you know when you are a you know a call to you know in the hopes evidence times\nUh then it's kind of a you know like with what we saw yesterday was like you know how to them in a way I kind of like put things into perspective and probably you know what they've been trying so you can lead to prove that they're so great at these kind of like start and people's minds actually you're not that great ...\nYou you use the word embarrassed when you look at the main figures in the ... and when you look at president ... for example\nBecause in the ... and when you look at president ... for example he doesn't look very embarrassed\nYeah well that's obviously not very surprising right like you know it was I was behind\nThe scenes there may be people looking at a red faced\nI'm sure they didn't receive than use our happy faces I'm sure that was like something that caused a a you know international backing especially that you are you know when you try to show off your at your skills and then you get called in the end of summer day at a at a time that's not really a great day for you [noise]\nAh but that's also like you know obviously like the the Russian or an additive old ways you know whenever that calls whenever there's an accusation is oldest denial it's always like you know or they look at\nThe uh the investigations they always say there's no blues over your city although we did see you know the ... pictures and all of these things so that's that's not really surprising let's say\n... ... when I'm not just as I said I Do find that I'm finished that it it it just creeping into our everyday lives of other things that you think we could practically due to to to to push back not necessarily finding things but within how we live our lives that allows to push back against this than\nI think that's a very good question I and I think you know a one of the things that we could do as citizens in our daily life as practice something called digital and hygiene\nSo very small things such as like you know\nA a changing your passwords often backing up your data being a little bit kind of like vigilant and care for how you deal with your uh online life like the same way though you did with you know for example the safety of your house right you wouldn't leave your door open and I expect that you know you are safe so it kind of like back this nice minimal things\nThat would I mean there has been some studies saying that if\nOf any move towards some sort of regulation of cyberspace\nYes well a that's a very good point I think you know what happened yesterday you should be put in the context of what's going on at the international level\nSo I'll eat to this this month Russia is planning on submitting to drop through the motions\nTo the U.N General assembly a one on basically imposing code of conduct for house they should behave with a to get a you know each other into cyberspace but also one or two I said just thing and you cybercrime convention to the place one that has been um implemented by the concept of Europe\nSo obviously there's a lot going on on the international scene that has not been linked in the media to what happened yesterday and\nI think um so the Russian activity and like you know a they wanted to supplement see but also they want to come to the negotiating table from the position of power\nAnd that has actually been said by as senior advisor to president but then saying that the upper paying something and the information every now that would lead them speak to the Americans as equals so you've got that on on one hand and also the western states obviously they're trying to push back against this ad is just so they wanted to kind of\nShow what the Russians are really doing and then try and get the countries you\nKnow that are not you know or Russia or China or like with the rest of the states that are in the middle of the un formally undecided the kind of like you know was their side so you could easily argue that point thank you very much for coming in any way to us

now it's been years since allegations of sexual abuse against many women over many years by the Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein first hit the headlines the outrage these provoked inspired a huge wave of support for the me too movement across the world\nGoing to hear now about the impact in China are women speaking out against abuse and Harris meant in twenty Fifteen a group of campaigners who became nuts\nHarris meant in twenty fifty and a group of competitors who became known as a feminist five was sent to jail for several weeks off to ... feminist leaflets\nThe American journalist and rice a laser Hong Fincher has been following this story and the story of the other women in China who are fighting for quality her new book is called betraying big brother the feminist awakening in China and she's joining us you know studio in Bristol in West in England at least welcome good morning\nGood morning thank you so much for having me\n... described the feminist five fifth vote to lose a bit more about the\nShore um well in twenty Fifteen there are a number of feminist activists I'm In several different cities in China\nWho wanted to celebrate International Women's day by handing out anti sexual harassment stickers at subways and bus stations but before they were even able to to carry out that activity\nThe Chinese police carried out a really sweeping round of arrests in multiple cities um arrested feminist activists and they ended up focusing on five young women in three different cities\nUm and brought the five women to Beijing where they put them in detention in the same detention center\nI'm and held them there for thirty seven days and and the jailing actually productive at an enormous global outcry um ... which created this global diplomatic pressure I I'm ... ... says the government made the unprecedented move of releasing the women\nIt was on President wasn't as it was ... the unexpected\nYes because the women look like they were on course to being criminally prosecuted and facing a jail term of five years or even more um but but the jailing of these women just angered so many people inside and outside China and it it ended up galvanizing the feminist community and\nChina and it it ended up galvanizing the feminist community and in China in particular\nA much more broadly defined clearly are the ones who've made headlines for the reasons you just described how much will be representing the day to day lives of Chinese women [noise]\nWell this is the thing first of all um these are just five women and they were almost randomly selected a by the authorities to send a message to other young women who are increasingly attracted by the cause of women's rights and feminism\nUm but actually the feminist community was even at that time much larger and um ever since the jailing of these five young women more and more young women in China have been drawn to the movement and it has just been growing 'em in momentum and continues to grow today\nLiterally to bring ... didn't have a wood too as well I'm Emma may be a question to\nWho's kind is it am I wanted to use it is going today I mean how how can we see this in China now what is the effect of me to currently on the\nYeah well I mean it's so interesting because originally when made two went viral globally I thought that that it can't take off to that extent in China because there's so many obstacles there's very very heavy Internet censorship there's no press freedom so unlike in the U.S square\nOn the news about Harvey Weinstein in you know sexually abusing all these famous Hollywood actresses that was broken by news organizations but there is on the news organizations in China are basically now propaganda outlets they're not allowed to do this kind of reporting for the most part\nUm and then then finally there is no independent judiciary so any victims of sexual abuse and China have virtually no recourse and\nJudiciary so any victims of sexual abuse in China have virtually no recourse and yet made to has really taken off in spite of all of the obstacles and and today you still see young women are emerging up all across China\nUm across sectors even across class coming out with their accusations their personal stories of sexual abuse for me to post to being censored ... well they a lot of them have been censored but it's not a blanket censorship on on the made to hash tax so\nThey're definitely stories that are getting through 'em and and also the feminist activists themselves are very creative and imaginative about finding new ways to get around the censorship\nOn for example one young feminists when when I made to hash tag was being censored um really aggressively one activist came up with the idea of using him oh jeez\nI'm for the characters that sound like me too and Chinese so she used a rice and Bonnie image eat me too\n[laughter] I should get around and edit worked for a while but then the benefit right Patricia\nI'm I just wondered whether this movement to give them some ended by the fact that I'm trying to start some Chinese from this insane so much with this or the one child policy on that because there were probably fewer women but in more than ... than the than there might have been a generation of but whether this played into it is it's all\nI think it may it it's really hard to tell at this point if there's any direct correlation it may have played a role because there have been studies that show that um when there's only one child and that the child has a daughter\nThan she doesn't have to compete with a brother for parental investments and so she may be\nAnd have to compete with a brother for parental investment and so she may be better educated than she would have otherwise been had she had a brother or more brothers\nWhy do you think we all ... apparently sued troubled by this I mean when you look at ... ideology that doesn't necessarily say to you that you should be one of the women complaining for equality or does it\nKnow of course not and this is why the jailing of these young feminists and twenty Fifteen provide such outrage because the Chinese government itself was founded on the principle of gender equality and it's written into the constitution of the People's Republic of China\nAnd in the early communist era of course one of ... famous sayings is that women hold up half the sky so that was what the Chinese people were taught\nAnd ... uh for several decades in the in the fifties sixties and seventies um and women were assigned jobs and they were a there was a lot more a gender parity in terms of\nPay well everybody was poor but but there wasn't just a huge and growing gender gap which really began with the onset of market reforms in China\nUm but but we're we're the onset of market reforms it means that the gender discrimination against women has has grown exponentially and that's one of the grievances that the main grievance of these young feminists\nThank you very much for coming on a letter home ... just taught me to say thank you very much to Patricia ... view company this morning and thank you for listening

account especially I Want to mention what a\nVarious political parties have done the wreck several years transforming that the transportation sector that we have here in in Norway\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across Norway and that's something that the I Believe that we should be quite proud of canned goods been since\nI agree last

society especially when we know that the transport sector is a big country it ... into the CEO to\nCredits yes so for me I I think it's very important that we have an active policy towards thinking new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives us the money to do all the research on have\nAll this ah green technology development\nGay Sunday is that I think that because of oil and gas we can't afford to be have a huge impact do make the climate better globally and we do the job abroad and we do a big jump inside no end up is because we have the money for more than ... to do the job\nWe do a lot of things in the rain forests ... we do look with the electrical cars you know way and that is a good thing\nAnd say ... safe from all the panels these green credentials their Christ office and ... are you getting to agree\nThis this ... view that shed by much of the new age in public that actually ... we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from no way we take it out cleaning from the ground\nAnd where the good guys and all of this I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in no way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that way\nSo it ... years are being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and the ... now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on importing fulfills funeral in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of renewable energy and that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in the ... and it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets\nTo which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as your\nConcerns should the new ... new exploration licenses for it and places like the ... seats in the ...\nI Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and Main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the bar and see today they will be still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate got submissions\nCan convince of well I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on coal in the work\nBut I Do not oil we're talking about yeah first of all\nMy point is that if you have replaced coal plants root for example gas or even oil there will be more green\nRoot for example of gas or even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway\nI have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah do you\nSeparate Christopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron seat because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw on a couple of when I was an exchange student and I came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said\nNo China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to national conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel I was in Oxford last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway as the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get off also feels\nTo get a false I feel ...\nI Would look at the time frame because college but says well it could be draining on two twenty Seventy yeah it will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it\nAnd remember that is based if we go to do a big big job to do to increase renewables about six thousand percent another huge huge jobs ... ...\nOn on how you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally if this was true we're not going to reach the China target the Paris Agreement the target is that you like to know is soft and we've been\nDebating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how far states being built how fast new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper than gas\nAnd oil team competition with the do as a politician\nIn a country like no way would you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green it's still difficult to sell they sell it is how into his anybody else can I buy and\nThese ideas Helena does anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in a way that it's become easy I've I've been working environmentalists just for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become you see act but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you think well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves and I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that\nWe're not talking about shutting down the protection that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince the kind of\nTo look on what are our options walked all the renewables for example\nWe are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable but where do you get to do so well uh you get to a perhaps if you're a lucky from an organic waste and it's part of this circle but ah if not you have to produce it by making\nSome of our lands part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineer's stuck the now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that the ... that's called actually knew now they change the name it's part of that strategy because they understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it\nIt's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green\nGay or at the same time we have to address CCS and his view because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use it is both a central themes in the transition into\nThe ... none of which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things that we could use our universities for the ... from the burned see is like another new regions they construct them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution there's a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we're carry you\nWants to Connecticut and she's yes it's definitely important and and we are in the situation in Norway let every political party actually ... let me just explain yeah what we mean by that cash a story and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away the underground or under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think the technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government to nowhere shifting governments have spent quite a ... a lot of money to trying to make that happen there is\nGetting down to the details again and he's there has been focused on an alright for Twenty years I think that also an to challenge to politicians here with a greater pen because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas\nWith a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if we're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to get time for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please do less than what you think of the program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story a BBC casual UK and you can subscribe to the ... such a BBC the real story in your pocket cost up\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has made possible by American public media producer and distributor of award winning public radio contact a pie and American public meetings with support from you our Craig bourbon handcrafted in small batches for a full flavored sipping experienced\nForty seven percent of the whole barn volume you larger Craig Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey orange sound Kentucky think wisely\nDrink [noise] [noise]\nGood morning you're listening to KU when our eighty eight point seven\nThank you for joining us for the b._b._c. World Service\n\nThat they have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nInterested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense ...\nTo bill and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is ... ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a sheep nation and I was so\nVery cause of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to ... other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he wanted to be part of really creating in the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration stuff we talked about there's only two developments in the region the Arctic to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries for really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway they have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so I'm sort of his other issues we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil\nOf all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in ... I think he would rather study of renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students asked for it\nCan cause fault no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you had the development in the uh the merit to him a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to hide the green shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expense and the a matter of time sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to wonder why I don't think I think you've made that yeah I\nKnow but it's ... it it sounds like it doesn't actually sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well if you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got the Gulf of them a good answer on that\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that ... and the ... now in the energy sector is really happening and they just happening in other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the speed\nOf of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely but my artist\nThere is well what a coal fired power plants absolutely but my argument is that you will see now that you and your ... and then she will indeed be more cost effective than fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWell that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new each gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls the way a little bit from Russia\nGave does it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian guys an older guys\nOn board that terminal comes from the burn seat comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than ... not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat you could argue that new region energies plane as some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to these powers that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn the ... have drilled about twice as much as Russia and we have sort of this expression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the ... and see and I don't think it's necessarily\nIn the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily good that Norway goes to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nYou does it does it according to the carbon browsing on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally sees the summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high and Europe\nGus will exclude coal leaf because of what you mean by that call them price the price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but\nUm there's a market inside Europe and the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those prices starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push health renewables\nFail and would have to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing in Germany they are afraid they'll be able to corporate pricing no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd since ... much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired and the gas fired power plants are\nThey are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway can't we can't take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and an expert of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy so\nOh I investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time with a we already made those commitments but it does is about what kind of you do we have for your past twenty states and Europe is committed to have hero come get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector of the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way but it's a very poor country in the Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people in my class or the way in which treats citizens of the fact that it gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on\nIf it was a on sometimes get or other to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... the underpins this country that's going to keep it wealthy but with no way somehow lose some of its stasis is no way\nAfraid perhaps on some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you painting a far too short picture because no it was a welfare state before ... came\n... made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast in Europe or the has the only place in Europe which hasn't been any feminine during history because we're always as easy accessible proteins so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on on thank God we didn't have an ability\nAnd thank God we didn't have an ability we we have again it's areas aside [laughter] I've been looking\nAt a lot of history and one important objective that's happened in Nineteen Seventy is supposed to keep them moderate pace of extraction\nAnd when they hit that limit that sat in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit triple production within Fifteen Years and then the ten years afterwards the almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states\nBut we also have this workforce that we can use for other purposes so I think tying myself too tightly to oil we should ...\n... but I guess I think what ... is somehow psychologically has it allowed no way to punch above its weight can\nI think we could just up the oil and gas tomorrow and it wouldn't have anything to do with our views on ourselves because\nThat means yours anyhow I mean we have we have a well first\nStates that's actually very clever because we have this big fund we use money from ...\nTo pay for our running bills not from the oil and gas industry directly itself so for our everyday living and the for the political system and decided to solve it wouldn't have anything to do\nAll of them of course we will lose future income but it would be very very stupid because in the European Union in the world they have to increase coal emissions because they would lose new reaching gas so that was my main point earlier um [noise] so I'm back to that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Reno", "day": "06"}
