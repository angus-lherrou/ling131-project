World Service my guests today has become the world's leading public intellectuals because much of his attention on identity how we humans see ourselves and others through the complex prism of race gender religion class on nationality\nFor Kwame Anthony Appiah the drive to begin the printer such questions comes from a very personal place the is the child of a circle mixed marriage his father was a lawyer and will commit\nAll of a so called mixed marriage his father was a lawyer and will connect ... politician in pre independence gone to his mother was an English woman of Eris the classic stalk Kwame Anthony Appiah was a gifted student who went to Cambridge University and became a professor of philosophy on ...\n... New York University He is a gay man who's married to his partner of more than two decades\nSo his own life is a fascinating example of how complex on multi led a sense of self can be\nAnd yet the way we humans define ourselves and define others often tends to be focused on the vision we use race religion and the class to separate us from them increasingly in this young century the politics of identity seems to be fueling conflict and hate\nSo is there an end to this preoccupation with group on tribe\nWell Kwame Anthony Appiah joins me now welcome to talk for the beer\nYou have spent a great deal of your recent professional life thinking about identity and how each and every one of us labels ourselves so let's start with a simple question how do you label yourself\nA little bit on who I'm Talking to a taxi drivers are usually I explain that I'm half a gun at enough British by origin and that I live in the United states that's the that gives me three countries to talk about in terms of some sort of national origin\nTo you when you describe where you're from and and the sort of ... of your identity although signify as are you thinking that you're sending ... ...\nIdentity although ... are you thinking that you're sending signals to your into lucky to er about about who you are\nYes I think I'm sending signals I think that sort of as it were weak signals from a faraway planet or something because because they don't tell you as much as I think many people assume\nUh they they will so I I grew up and gone and my father was going to end\nBut that doesn't tell you very much about how interested I Am and gun or it doesn't tell you how much I Know about God as as I Am the death of that is and so on many people that would be more informative to know what their nationality is you know if it's at\nBut I end up pretty quickly in a conversation I think you move beyond the the stereotypes into into more detail and then it doesn't matter so much that it's not all that helpful\nWould it be too simplistic to say the ... in in all of your work on a race religion and creed as you put it on gender and all the different ways that we can\nIdentify ourselves into identify ourselves and others your conclusion is that frankly we roll so complex and so unique that almost any label we apply is in some way or rather misleading\nI think that's right if you take any bill the big labels that you know the race religion nationality I'm even class you know one of those there's so much diversity within them\nSo you know men are all ... men and not all the same man is very different from one another women are very different from one another or people in Britain ... different from one another people in London a different from one another in a million ways so that being told somebody to London and then actually give you a huge grip on or anything\nAre very important about them which doesn't mean that there are moments\nVery important about them which doesn't mean that there are no moments when ... isn't hugely important that people um there are Marilyn elections it's important to be if you're a London that when when the mayor is being elected if there were big as they have been in the past big terrorist attack in London that would bring them together they have a sense that Mm okay we're all facing this together\nThe current government uses nationalist and polarizing cultural messages\nAnd it does but the point you alluded to earlier you ultimately Arnold ... believe that the trajectory of the human condition is in a in that positive ... toward a more universe list a more\nHumane understanding compassionate humanity I guess how can you square that with what you see well uh\nI I guess because I'm looking at it over a longer horizon than just five or ten years old penalty as I'm thinking about how much things have improved in these respect\nOr in many ways over the last century I'll say for example think about the massive improvements in the condition of waiting thousand people in many many countries over the last century look at the massive\nReduction in a racial or discrimination in the law in the United states over the last hundred years look at the edge of the increasing coming together of Europe at the same moment of these\nIncreasing coming together of Europe at the same moment of these moments of nationalism and putting breaks it to one side which one has to do\nAnd you're a ... is way more unified in the United uh than it was in the in the nineteenth century so uh or even in the mid ... century so I think older they say if you look over long enough horizon you can see the general tendency is in the direction that I Would regard as up\nOne area where I can see that you would find solace would be in the way in which certainly in in the western world\nAh societies and cultures view a gender issues then particular sexuality I mean your your uh uh a known for very long time in out gay man you took advantage of America is changing laws so that you could Mario long term partner\nHow far can we go\nWith the notion that human beings are now free to choose their identities in ways that we never even thought of before not just in terms of of sexuality but even in terms of a basic gender where now there is a\nA very powerful movement to to change the way the binary way we see men and women are a lot of people who define themselves as ... binary there are others who are transgender ring and society slowly appeared to be moving\nTo to accept them in New ways where does this end well\nDon't think he ends the ... there are two things at the airport but where it doesn't that doesn't then with the disappearance of identity we are reforming our gender system but by not getting rid of gender altogether I can I can ... I Believe that I Belong all into the remote future we'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary\nWe'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary system but there will be men and women than some people in between\nEnters the question is where the self\nIdentity and because the interestingly I I'm I'm launching between different spheres but but I I'm mindful on how to do it so long ago we spoke to a woman cold ritual does though who\nIs a white parent age but identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and on and live to live for a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\n... being black is and she said look I I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore\nTo that extent I'm black well I think she's a very good\nCase to think about because you ask what's the relationship between self ... and and another I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you count simply declare the meaning of your own race all on their own race has a special category you need to\nIf you if you don't like where it's put you you need to persuade the well to change that is what trans people have done the trans people have done what Rachel ... didn't do which is they've\nCreated a movement to allow them\nTo be what they want to be an artist and they've asked us to change the system I have I'm happy to respond affirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity to adapt system in that way and even if it did a little bit of how do I basking in the I'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them\nI'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them a phrase will do they all had could have provided a could've made these arguments on the sly to people and began to thing and if you could have done this in the way it was a little bit more straightforward because what she was actually doing she knew involved\nConcealing something that other people thought was important that she didn't think it was important and that's an interesting fact about that but unfortunately a black in America doesn't belong to her and so the only way it can be changed\nIn the direction that she wants and I'm just I'm willing to listen to her arguments living it that way is if she makes the arguments creates the movement and she can't do that on her and she has to do with other people just to persuade other people\nIn this interview and indeed in some of your writings you'd have been very consistent saying it's not my job to fix the society is simply to understand and explain how societies work to my fellow citizens now I I Can't do that\nBut do you have ideas which you can share with me as as to how to overcome the lies that currently under paying our identity\nI think the most important thing for us to overcome and to the extent that getting rid of the lies helps I'm In favor of that is is the the moments when identities leads to to hostility and hatred and division that's the thing that one's looking for\nFor that I think some things can be said or but these are just things that are known to social psychologist one is don't close yourself off people who live with people of diverse identities tend to be less than people did that and so don't allow yourself\nThey get to than people did that and said don't allow yourself to be channeled off\nInto a world in which you only are among white people only among Catholics certainly among 'em straight people and so on open your eyes open your social experience do people live all the major kinds and do things with them that's not about race or religion\nOr or sexuality but there are about soccer or about to go to the movies are about\nUm you know building something in the community together with together with people because I think working together with people of diverse identities makes the identity is less dangerous and then frankly\nIf you have folks ideas about them as long as the ... leading you to behave badly I'm not so worried about the people have false ideas about absolutely everything not just identity level of ideas about cooking and it and if it doesn't do much home I'm not too worried about\nFinal thought that we have a a thinker and rice or in the United kingdom called David good heart who said that these days the most important distinction and identity that that one can use when looking at people in western society is between those he calls\nAnyways and the sequels some ways now the anyways other highly educated usually metropolitan highly immobile people who are comfortable\nIn an open intellectual environment living pretty much anywhere in their own country or indeed in the world that would be you and then the somewheres on deeply rooted people who are not so immobile whose fault persist as a small localized not so open\nAnd then they according to David good hot I'm much less interested in the kind of ideals\nThe kind of ideals that you've just been painting with me I Am happy to live in the world with the somewhere as I just don't want them shaping the world for the rest of us in a way that makes us it very difficult for us to do what we want to do so if my my favorite example this is the American example of the Amish in Pennsylvania\nThey throw themselves off they don't like to talking to strangers they don't like money they don't like America like lots of things that I think of as ... as sort of an ethical Boston will and they've made a will to themselves I think they're entitled that I Believe I Believe that that that their freedom is a simple as anybody else's freedom\nAt ... and they don't do any harm to the rest of my stay there garage into the will campaigning against the others they just live separately I don't mind that I think if you want to be somewhere like that that's fine\nBut if you want to be the kind of someone who wants to take over the United states or Britain and turn it into a country of somewhere as a than I Am a on the other side from you I I I'm a live and let live kind of person\nI understand the attractions of locality I remember the pleasures of of my grandmother
