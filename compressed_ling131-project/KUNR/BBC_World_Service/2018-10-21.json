is an extraordinary spirit in Afghanistan which she got never fails to him\nAfghanistan which she never fails to impress\nThis is a country which has been to fourteen years of brutal war with many Afghans saying the situation here is the worst it has ever been and there's great cynicism and politicians in the political protests and yes thousands of people have put themselves up\nTo be candidates in these parliamentary elections and more young educated Afghans than ever before are putting themselves forward\nHundreds of Central American migrants have taken to rough some boats to cross the river on the border between Guatemala and Mexico in an attempt to continue that journey to the United states as he ... reports from the border\nHaving left Honduras more than a week ago trucked across quite a ... an overwhelmed local security forces are up to four thousand people were\nStuck on a bridge with the Mexican border gates firmly shot\nSome remain on the bridge having made

America's southern boot it will be closed to the migrants but the problem is the best of economic future for themselves and their families is proving a strong driving force\nFor days off to closing

last half hour of the program we'll hear from a senior U.S senators talking about the death of the Saudi journalist ...\nPlus the American jazz singer Madeleine pay rue about how much politics should ones music reflect a roast when I when it hit a news report from the Sunday Times Danny ... kinda Rogers his secretary general of civic 'cause Johannesburg based on bread organization for various\nCivil society groups which you are leaving at the end of the year that's right how do you reflect on your time\nWell I've seen that for six years and they've been pretty depressing um I mean I think if you look at the evidence of what's happening on civic freedoms around the world for example is rasa because monitor we you know we've documented serious threats to one or more civic freedoms that you know the rights that we have to speak out take action come together\nUm there have been serious threats in more than a hundred countries and just in the last year including some mature democracy so\nFor ... and that's about ... protecting than promoting citizen action the we live in some worrying times\nA ... I have this many times newspaper with me a big splash on page H written by you this is reflecting on the march in London yesterday by people calling for a second referendum\nIn London yesterday by people calling for a second referendum on the deal for bricks it when you write something like that give them that you know the will of being covered on the television on the radio extensively by the time I pick it up and read it what do you try to when you're trying to say and do\nWell that's more of a sketch phase and ... and say it's all sort of reflective\nVigils stories are coming out of people\nYou yes which I always think it's a nice nice but that is that you Kevin you find the people having fun um and you have to make it lively people do so laundry to cause you're quite right by the by that time effort nice to have as much as they you know when you've got a report on something like that is not as they what you're saying is revelation unless something enormous happened that\nUm and and you're covering it from that side say so yes it is much more of a sketch and and that's quite fun to write but it does mean over the or trying to follow on you'll find asthma sending in your coffee and which is never I'd done when you've got that many people it presents a generalist it challenge because\nAnd everybody you know you couldn't get email because I was saying many people that that was a little bit tricky but that is that\nIt's there it's on page writes a excitement is past seven GMT President Trump\nHas confirmed that the U.S plans to withdraw from a key nuclear weapons treaty with Russia he said Moscow had repeatedly violated the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty\nWhile America had owner did Russia has denied those US claims so who's right President Trump or the Russians Daryl Kimball is the executive director of the arms control association that is a U.S based known parties or an organization which promotes public understanding of arms control policies\n... organization which promotes public understanding of arms control policies\nWill the United states beginning in two thousand fourteen alleged and I believe it correct that Russia tested a ground launch cruise missile beyond the five hundred kilometer range limit allowed by the treaty and began to deploy a small number of these missiles\nProbably somewhere in central Russia off and on efforts through diplomacy to\nConfront Russia about this demand that they return to compliance were unsuccessful but I think the diplomatic options to deal with it so clearly not been exhausted there was only one needy\nIn the past year between us and Russian officials to discuss the matter\nSo yes Russia has violated the treaty but the question is does us withdraw makes sense from a security standpoint doesn't bring Russia back into compliance with I think it does\nWell one of the things they love the Britain leaving me is that we and our I'm willing to scrutinize or other like set we have I Would argue I mean as somebody like that instead of having a midlife crisis leaving leaving never liable\nAnd partner and gathering and finding says all the other and more dangerous friends and I think um willingness to ... come on the highway safety strike need any ... tales of leaving the biggest market in the wild\nAbsolutely I mean it to the ultimate question is how much are those Brewster new any other country wants to be the policemen of the world is this a ruling or is that is that to global responsibility and when we say global that includes Russia and China who work on the church was different set of values that we in the west operate\nOn what though if more images I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from turkey if some reports a right to some of the evidence could be extremely gruesome would that change things\nMurder is or was gruesome regardless of how it takes place um and I think ah the Turks have been politicizing the way they've been dropping dripping information and then saying don't don't take this subject\nBeing in dripping information and then saying don't don't take this into account that's an authorized leaks so it's important to look at a at the whole thing in context social she was murdered and he was um as as Saudi Arabia has said was murdered by at least senior officials\nAnd I and I think we just have to wait for the results of the investigation bugs how does that how's the world would react to it\nAnd of course they remember that when when you all happening in Yemen they will still gathering and very heartening what what do you think about not\nWhat I mean that the game and crisis is is is another one you've got it it's it's not an easy subject that's operating there it's Iran with who says if the straits of of um of my rape in the south is Red Sea coast that's Fifteen Percent of global trade goes through the straits that means massive inflation that's going to affect us\nAll goes through there it's it's ... you know you could argue that Saudi has actually fighting the war of the west of war because of the south is news and the Iranians close the straits it's us in the west who would be having to pay the price for it\nOne of the things we're told about why the west supports the Saudi regime is that sort of fragile and complexity of political settlement in the middle east what would happen if the west actually took the bold step of not propping up the Saudi regime\nWhat I mean that's what's happened in two thousand and three with Iraq and that led to the creation of ISIS and we're still dealing with that I think it'd be much worse if the same thing is repeated with Saudi\nBecause it's not only Sunni extremists who wouldn't exploit this but the Shiite extremist and and and you you have and then you've got the oil is um we have severe political and economic repercussions that will take many many years\nSevere political and economic repercussions that will take many many years even longer than the Iraq War repercussions would still which will still dealing with no\nThank you very much into becoming particularly somebody as we look ahead to that event in Saudi Arabia this week it's a twenty two minutes past the hour we'll get away with some music because Madeleine ... is an American singer born in the state of Georgia she grow up in New York and California but for many years she has been living in Paris\nHe'll multi de la ... gene you don't know\nThis is ... the final track of her new album and submit so originally from opposing bipolar ... from the top of the world war two the album was mostly written in the U.S during the last\nPresidential campaign that when Madeleine came in and she told me how the political debates at the time left that mark on that album\nYeah I Am doing some line and try to see them\nThat that doesn't know\nEarly two thousand sixteen we started doing smaller venues and little clubs around the United states throughout the primaries and caucuses 'em and various debates and\nThe ins and outs of the day to day news that I felt was worth addressing a little bit in our shows just so that I could introduce a song and say\nThis is dedicated to anyone who's not represent doesn't feel represented by the government and then do the song and we'd get laughs in some places and in other places we'd get like\nDo the song and we'd get laughs in some places in other places would get like an angry years but the state of our shows just felt the atmosphere of of politics was unavoidable\nOn different from any that you've experienced before a\nLittle bit I mean the fact that the news invades our lives in a way that it didn't few years ago and certainly not Twenty years ago when I started doing these little clubs and things like that and yeah so I just started to feel like it would be great if\nSome of this stuff we could talk about it instead of just trying to find a clever introduction to a song and simultaneously Larry ... who I've worked with many times over the years and had just started by saying you know let's come over here and let's try this thing where we all sit in a room together five of us\nAnd that's what this was a group of musicians of rights as all collaborating effectively yeah ... then you\nKnow changing chain and then my time on Long Island so\nUm my hero [noise] ... um\nI mean one thing that struck me because I Know there was one particular review that I wrote which talked about I think I've done it with what's your comment or somebody a alongside you talking about the danger of being\nI think the word was pre ... and it's a difficult balance isn't it because you want people to enjoy the music and the lyrics with it but if they don't necessarily agree with the sentiments it gets to more difficult\nYeah but I think even beyond that it's just not artistic too\nBeyond that it's just not artistic to stand up and say you know here's what I think and you should agree with me and if I keep yelling at you because I've got the stage you know I've got the podium because he ... paid to come and see the show or whatever it is that they gave you\nThis audience it's so presumptuous to think that people want to be told what's right but it's\nFar more artistic to ask a question and it's more fair and it's just more right oh birds they\nSang at the ... de\nDa de\nDa de\n... on what his parents are doing\nThey're meant to tells personal stories and uh that each one of these stories is you know these are meant to be\nSo I've sort of like life life experience type stories like down on me where you just can't get out of a circle of debt or\nFind some kind of financial ruin that might have just happened by accident you don't really know [noise] so yeah these are all stories that I think are relevant to the ... my experience of America is and their stories that I I think I intended\nTo at least for the most part said hey let's let's talk about this and um\nYou know the song and some wasn't the starting point but it ended up being the summary\nAnd ended up there for being the title and so this recording of this poem by ... carries the almost like the book and sort of like the counterweight to answer this quest for what is democracy and freedom and what's\nTo answer this quest for what is democracy and freedom and what does it mean\nYou didn't grow up in frogs but do you spend a significant portion of your life in Paris and I think when you was that that had a huge influence on the style of music that you have gone on to the plant before him isn't it [laughter] it's ironic because it\nGave me more of a\nUnderstanding of how important my American music that you know is to me and\nSolidified some of the things that I loved about I Love about it you know of course also there's just a genuine appreciation for American jazz in Europe that does not get the same time a day at a\nMuslim ... she'll be performing in the u._k. in November you'll have

World Service [noise]\n\nLet's say you could sprint for American the American world record would then be Seventeen minutes rather than just over a hundred and twenty minutes\nAnd the reason the body can't do that is because you cannot supply that energy rapidly enough using the aerobics system aerobic metabolism is quite slow whereas Arabic metabolism is extremely false you know your classic and aerobic events of the hundred meters two hundred meters four hundred meters\nAnything above that it's the aerobic system the predominant ...\nIs there a speed limit or to the limiting factor as\nWell in distance running we like to think of three parameters the first of all those is you'll maxima law says you're not take all your vehicle to max as we sometimes call it which is if you like the size of your engine and that determines ... by the size of your calls\nThen you've got the ... threshold a ... type threshold is if you like how much of an injury and can you\nThreshold is if you like how much of an engine can utilize before you know there are consequences the third parameter is your running economy so what is your engines fueled economy\nYou want the highest view to max possible the highest lactate fresh all possible and so to be as economical was possible if you put those three together you'll run a false marriage for the marathon run as we know of Puerto record for example has amongst the best\nFemale video to match the best female lactate fresh out of the best female running economy values ever recorded in a human and lo and behold she's\nAmerican world record holder [noise]\nCan grease the stone ... runners guessing the twenty six mile ... three or four hours nowhere near the marathon will record of about two hours but then again they go to know the Follies

very much a case of trying to limit the amount of damage that you do to a buddy in that particular event when we talk about five and ten thousand meat to running we often talk about you know you've got to get up to a certain place you go to\nRunning we often talk about you know you've got to get up to a certain place you go to be able to hold up pace in an old truck in July ... you're trying to do is complete the task and I remember there was a time when I trained an old tradition in Toronto to run a sixty mile event and it was quite an interesting thing because he was a former sprint\nAnd he run like a good sale he was absolutely beautiful rain gee running style much it immediately you need to shuffle because you run sixty miles like that you're going to break down at thirty so he actually learned how to run like an old truck distance runner which is trying to run with minimal leg lift\nA century trying to minimize the energy costs of you'll run [noise]\nOr if we can ... diem is he reaches the ... strong when he's having to pass it starts to the\nRanks got hit by a car I got hit yes\nBut anyway as everyone\nHey how you run a marathon and been hit by a kind of how Israel in that regard\nBasically how are you feeling you know like I just ran a marathon yeah okay I was kind of below conservative just to keep my energy you haven't breaking a sweat\nNot yet yeah we had a long way to go [laughter] I Know that you start seeing a you hungry not so much yet you have to have to eat or do you get like hungry\nProperly you got to remember the good and sometimes you forget to eat and that's the bad thing\nFeeding station to get along the ...\nFeeding stations the Scots along the ... when you're on the move for the tea six hours you're going to need to eat\nBut how much will this brings us back to our listening audience question wants is the best thought for insurance exercise\nToo was wondering about cussing have food and take to the minimum [noise] he's a good only do we find ... an ultra marathon runner Alex cook for some help\nOne really important thing I must say that any estimate is that each individual say well what you'll teammate ... what the aid that was one thing that kind of escape for night if I if you aren't ... nutritional me you're not going to raise your full Coleman's potential\nIs there a clash between trying to run and using your digestive system does one put stress on the other\n[noise] yeah they really common for a change or in the late may need to do stuff at stomach ... when I write things\nAnd the snow was specifically wondering if it was a good idea to come down to one meal a day to reduce the pressure on her digestive system night\nThan it you know eating one meal a day is not gang he had to you any when they meet the new nutritional clemency your body needs to perform at that level\nSo how do you get the right balance between eating enough to a few yourself whilst avoiding pushing unnecessary stress on your digestive system\nSay stressful and it's about making sure that the each in the right time\nAn eating the right things it generated by says eating a nine now so three to four hours before we train and then maybe you have any small that's not an hour before training and say well you made pot and pray team do you don't get to digest set about making sure that you know having things that\nYou high in fat and protein and some good slavery\nSo about making sure that you know having things that came hindsight I'm facing and we'll get slavery hydrate Rachel ... before you try any individually I find is that people read up on NATO does somebody down and told her in South and find that he doesn't want to then\nPresumably you get to that through trial and error yeah yeah you day and so maybe I should try one meal a day find if it works for her\nI mean I think she will find pretty quickly that it doesn't take notes I had realized that eating one meal a day it's sunny not cheating strategy training for an either\nYou are listening to crowd science from the b._b._c. World Service where we ... the limits of human endurance we just heard how looking off to you buddy by giving it in a few is essential but the psychological side of insurance is so critical\nOne of the time the runners get tough way through the ... for example they still have to run one hundred and twenty three kilometers much of that through the night\nI think the first time you run with their legs and the next happy run with their mind there comes a point in the race where the pain is a it owns you and you have to reckon with the fact that you're in a lot of pain and it's not going to go away and to deal with it\nWhat I Do is I Try to be in the moment not to think about how\nMuch further the finish line is I just think about getting to the next tree\nAnd get to the next roadside put the blinders on as far as the future don't reflect on the past just be the best that you can be in the present moment of time\nAnd that'll get you through some tremendous love [noise]\nMidnight it's still it's raining\nStill it's raining\nUnder a bridge that was a couple of ... and some ... slights stuck into the wool the lighting up just under this bridge\nWe're wasting his uh dean and the other issue to run his who coming free\nSee [laughter]\nHow are you girls [noise] more importantly how\nAre you into a real at this point [noise] you know your whole body starts to hurt\nThe neurons looking exhausted we didn't want to slow down we run alongside him down the mountain lanes so ... what is it like taking each pay a it's\nReally demoralizing going this boy I mean like how I did that I was thinking I was five\nHours ahead of this place I think you're doing a really good job oh well I appreciate you saying that that gives me energy [noise]\nYou said this is the weather the psychological game is important\nAh very much so [noise] I'm Still moving forward is not is not produce not fast but it is a movement kick me in the butt in terminated keep going\nKeep going hey you can do it using them for any job will see for breakfast\n\nCan have the stillness around there was nothing we're on a hillside in Greece and dean\nThere was nothing we're on a hillside in Greece and dean has just\nRun off into the darkness hunting ...\nThe prospect of running over amounts in in the dark and rain when you've already been going to Seventeen hours and still have a hundred kilometers ahead of you imagined the psychological strength that requires\nThem to come to mind is a sports psychologist specializing in insurance\nAnd I asked her if there's something special about the mindset of people he take part in these events there's some evidence to suggest that those who can be an alternate ... has a high paying tolerance\nWe don't quite know where did I paint tolerance is the results of pushing yourself and going through all these events or whether that's something that you have to start and therefore you pick up those kind of even\nEighty eight point seven in Ninety One point seven K.

agreements asked out of the fence and diplomatic correspondence Jonathan Marcus if President Trump was justified and putting out\nHaven't seen a huge amount of the evidence so though to be faster the uh this is a concern that predates the Trump Administration the Obama administration a signal so that they believe the Russians with developing such a weapon or now though the Russians ah we're told her that she deployed this system\nThe difficulty of courses that many advocate\nThe difficulty of courses that many advocates Saddam's control see this is just another\nCat and the whole fabric of

costs may well have other concerns to remember this was only a bilateral free the between Russia or adults then Soviet Union and the United states and of course China was able to go ahead a quite legally and develop weapons in this range\nBan does it well and I think there are certainly some in the Trump Administration who fear now with the growing strategic competition in the Pacific with China\nAs the INS treaty I'm Judy constrains what they can do and they basically taken the view that if the Russians that aren't ready as they said they see it in breach of the treaty than what the hell they have you is is the value of the thing why should they be constrained any longer\nSo does this mean a new Cold War and other arms race\nIt's a difficult thing to say I mean I'm not sure that we're in a coal for quite a lot quite like the last one that does mean a you know policy a whole system of uh of regulating and uh uh confront willing\nOr the build up of a nuclear forces has been

allies that are of course the question is was his response\nAnd of course the question is what is the response going to be a in Europe I think it's very unlikely that the Americans are going to deploy a new missile systems are\nIn the NATO countries of Europe I think in many of them that would be a huge political opposition to such a move and I think you know some in the west many in the west

Stiglitz comes down to the continued reliance recall them is on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nWere blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind believed that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing

after Adam Smith the conservatives that miss used his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will hand often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys themselves things in their self interest and trades freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by then to find some other ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets so flawed the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple it's just that somebody knows something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close
