no no absolutely not no no no I Wonder why no I uh I Do have to let fans problem I think you've seen it before and I said yeah yeah yeah you're right you're\nYeah so we're we're all she broke off from a community center in in this town ... where are you actually in ...\nI'm In the basement of hospitals that's given their space do this river cafe [noise] so this is Ron from the basement of a home in the basement of hospitals really that's interesting and it's and it's a bright open face I wasn't expecting it to be quite as a spaceship and welcoming and I've got four no with me she's one of the co founder\nAnd also I Would like to I guess ah why did you feel there was a need for repair cafe in Bangalore because we in in in Holland we would think that's in India people would still have repair skills\nAre we mistake on\nThe need for the fact is that because the older generation of bad is getting lost the ... living in um\nA nuclear families and a a via not seeing a A R people that are betting that owned us so that ... that is a need to bring this concept again yard\nThey paid is there isn't a gene for the genes of sleeping and I don't that's why we need to make it if we need to open it up a vacant\nLots of ... business was an engineer anyway [noise]\nThere are many the bishops said that although this is also the pick of the bed there's a big market nearby it's at all in the car no\nAfter you get away from harming most other businesses who say you're taking a long viewed away from it [noise]\nIn this back and say you have professional to better also sitting along with us along\nThe back and say you have potential to better also sitting along with us along with well India's a so uh it said the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better they are not taking their business over the\nCourse of their lives like points to go ahead what we find that it's\nObviously politicians are but it is about saving the planet but it's also by saving people money\nOn what we find is that people in all kinds of the day they can't afford to take something along to a professional repair uh\nI'm guessing assessed tend to be told it can't be repaired\nSo what we do is we do at least the assessment for free and then maybe we say it is worth taking a tour in Paris so we take out some of the expense or on the person is going to the professional repair uh knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC halfway down have those schools\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get to repair back in to our daily lives is that a professional repairs would become cheaper\nAnd now for many people repairing professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor and\nNeighbor isn't text tiny so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that labor or should be tax lower so that\nA professional repair to become more attractive in in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their business and um [noise]\nI don't know of course there will be different labor costs in different positions of well so\nWhat you're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet [noise]\nAfter listening to have\nOne thing I wanted to talk about that I was you know for the solution\nOne thing I wanted to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work and just the costs were alone people going out of their way to get stuff amended in the first place I'm for whatever reason a lot of people just don't think like that as I found out when I paid a visit\nTo a landfill sought the other day I have a listen to this\nWill be comforted today and I'm Talking some topics I made a half [noise]\nThrow this is the golden shelters broke yeah\nYeah he found that if I can say yeah I mean you say totally broken beyond repair rule I don't know if he's he's so frightened Nicholas ... holes in the so nice out I mean I Wonder when someone cannot replace the mental pause\nIt might be able to save and buy from even ... I just think it's just easier to get rid of that so they may they might have been ... is it is it the time as well during the time yeah fun yeah I've got two kids that have to run and I just called the ... really sometimes it's just no price cool place [noise]\nWhat's in it that was kind of stuff to do some cameras stuff you know when you put on all ends and the\nYeah um yeah that will be on the unfortunately I'm too old to a point where they come used because they got fungus in general things wrong with them so that I buy them because you ... is\nThat you can try but that's not really much point that it wasn't going to take you to pieces and cleaning around would cost a ridiculous amount of money it's a perfectly good about the option of putting it just\nComes down to the fact that that's where that's interesting\nThat that's where it goes to working older about twenty quit or in the right place at ... or somewhere like that I was little hemorrhage ... ten times that much so you've got your\nYour your lenses and we're going to put them in the world is is this little applause has been no I've already been up here and how to look in their ...\nWe should we be doing things to reuse things but it comes down to ... county if does only says secrecy did um\nThan you can hardly blame people for buying the right to stuff especially if they knew of cooking is going to be generally cheaper than able to quit when I Need a better job [noise]\nSo there are a couple of issues that arise that I Wonder you know ... people have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but like often gets in the way they're too busy I just don't have the time\nYeah obviously uh people are pretty busy that day to day life but ah there is a lady informed community of people around uh who are very conscious about their\nEnvironment that that saying that you know we get some thoughts we get ... response because people want to do their bitch in ah in their surroundings and so that the things they are actually doing lord of the food so that things don't go to lunch and\nMust you know I Wonder if you could kind of address that issue I some of the people here in this for a cafe\nOr you you what kind of preaching to the converted they have a reason because they're they're already on board with the environmental movement without ... how'd you get the other people how do you correct the other people who as we heard from the people look at the tip who are quite happy just to throw stuff away\nWell that's a challenge of course but we hope\nWell that's a challenge of course but we hope to get them into the repack cafe when they have something\nThat they really want to hang on to win that when it's a precious broken object that cannot be so easily replaced by a cheap you type and we know that that's what happens when people come to the ... they don't really expect things to be read that but when\nThey come here and when they see that it can be done it really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind towards a more sustainable society\nWe're running short time now the ... cafe in Holland is still still going to some people that are fixing a coffee machine they pulled it Paul has a chapter with a large Sean again into the workings of the device some final thoughts on from every ... months you know ways to solve it can be in ten Fifteen Years taught\nWell I think that will be more repack cafes because they'll they'll they'll be needed but we also hope that manufacturers realized that product should be re bearable and that they should be a producer in a more sustainable way so that they can be repaired in a proper way\nMaybe you might have a three D. prints are in in ... so you could principles bad policy to to fix the things that you don't have the whole stretch the way\nThat will be challenging but um maybe in the future\nYou love that Christmas you\nOh yes I mean I think the future preparing cafes is as much around bringing people together and I think coming to RIMPAC cafe or it does create a sense of community that togetherness it creates friendships slow people down for a little bit while they actually\nIt creates friendships I'm kind of slow people down for a little bit while they actually learn a little bit about more about that product somehow that can be amended so I think it has a much wider role to play than simply connecting broken items with Paris hits hits hits connecting people with each other [noise]\nMy thanks to everyone to mock Tina I'm Petra here and put them to Chris in London and Chevy ... thank you for this thing too well tax [noise] if you want to see ... cafe in action and making a video from ... it'll be that soon\nWill tax will be back next week for most of the nation from around the world but for now I'm all for most a clause in how to repair and electronic thing this happens or I'm going to get a hero's welcome from my wife has that comes back fixed\nAlthough of course there's no patches it [noise]\nOf course if it does get ... you know I'll shamelessly train all the credit for myself to buy [noise]\n\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

D. but the ... one of his stand was a personal one\nIt is perhaps as nothing compared to the brand advocacy adopted by the u._k. handmade cosmetics company lush founded by a group of business people in the Nineteen nineties who are already active campaign is on various issues\nLush has adopted an extraordinary range of campaigns promoting things like conservation animal welfare gay rights\nThings nothing to do with soap perhaps most\nGay rights things nothing to do with soap perhaps most controversial you they've attacked police operations ... office as I said to have said juiced activists in order to get inside campaign groups in Britain\nThanks [laughter] [noise] [noise]\nWell that campaign ... didn't stop with videos like this one different I'm also put up a window displays and its doors with a mock up of a police officer in and out of uniform alongside the tagline paid to lie\nNot surprisingly this has caused some outcry not just from the police but also Britain's home secretary the thumb since bank down on his campaign ethics direct to Henry James admitted a bit of a mistake that but she said the campaigns will not about to stop\nObviously we took a huge amount of backlash which you know I had a personal cost to us and stuff that same time it called the she talked about in the u._k. at a level that it had never been talked about before so I guess that in some ways we just have to view the emotional impact on us as collateral damage to a greater good\nYou have all kinds of campaigns not just that one of course campaigns ... animal testing you both campaigns are we at trends phobia of fracking folks hunting new theory shoes plastic packaging the list\nGoes on how does that relates to selling ... products\nWhat we try not to relate it to something past presidents because oldest I say she said you just mentioned the things that we will cap I'm passionately ... before we became a company that made sense we've leveled campaign as an activist before we came in ... and that includes the people who started lash so obviously\nThe whole campaign as an activist before we came in ... and that includes the people who started lush so obviously there's a whole host of things that we will care about and we built a business that suddenly became big enough that we could use all shop fronts on our website to actually talk about the things\nThat we were campaigning about not private lives so for us as a huge volume on those issues it's not marketing thing\nOkay so this is a little just heartfelt stuff it's not anything to do your saying with the commercial end of the business know how's that affecting the commercial end of the business\nWe have to ... when he first started campaigning publicly that we would never on judge a campaign by its sales figures that we would never look the two up at the same time because it would make you hesitate to ever to win again so that little with facts and we largely stick to it as\nEverybody wants to be right now how is it affects is you'll say oh I can\nTell you they don't want to because actually surprisingly it puts sales op\nSo when the campaign people came to you saying that sales were up this was during the spike ups campaign that was getting all the negative publicity\nUh yes yes during the spike up campaign and yet it wasn't on campaigns people it was actually our accounts people came to us and made a phone call and said you know don't worry sales are actually up you're not going to believe this you know an tang on in that\nIs that because any news is good news\nI think it's cause any news is good news or I Would hope that what it was was a customer standing by us that they were really literally holding all hands through it and saying you know it's okay with you we know what you do we know why you do it and we're going to keep shopping with you know we don't care if you mess up and we don't care if you mess up sometimes\nI mean I I get what you're saying and I get the thing's a heartfelt and do you separate the two things I I suppose I'm Still slightly struggling to understand why you'd be bothered with even trying to sell soap or other products 'cause my sex if you'll campaigns are served as Britain have absolutely nothing to do with that I mean why marry the two in the first place I guess we marry the two\nAre served as Britain have absolutely nothing to do with that I mean why marry the two in the first place\nI guess we marry the two because we built this huge brand we're on high streets around the world and it will be will miss roots not to allow the people that are working on the issues we care about access to science facility that we have built so you've got a platform we have a massive platform\nDo you think it is now we're living in an Arab a house where it's allowed for for corporate ... and ... to take a stand but he's more overtly controversial\nI Do think so yes I think that younger people coming up care about the things they care about they used to talking on line to other people who care about them and exchanging information and I think they won bronze to be counted that\nWould you like the Nike I mean like Nike and you and what you'll do would you like the other companies doing more this activist campaigning and as part of the brand promotion\nI'd like to see companies take a look at the world see what's wrong do something about it in the supply chains do something about it in the way they interact with the world as well as in the slick\nMarketing I think it is more companies cat and actually you know ... to

dead on the shores of Scotland and Ireland in recent weeks\nSuggests a much bigger problem or to put it into context two years to a year is considered to be a normal figure here we have more than sixty I've been speaking to on through brown low director of the Scottish marine animals stranding scheme\nThis is sort of listen to what we would normally see in in ... not struggling so unusual mortality event because I'm the conferences that are coming at a show of incredibly decomposed so um we we are she had an investigating this less smoke pathology point of view and move\nSo um we we are she had an investigating this last month pathology point of view and moved from a sort of oceanographic aspect to try and work out why these animals have come from\nSo it's not that they're being washed off and then they die that that when they reach the surface\nYes exactly um so when we we we have an investigation program that looks at uh the causes mortality of of mammals are stations sales a central\nAnd I'm In the past we've had what a cool ... running events where we turned up on the beach and the uh I'm a significant number of animals I'm all in one group um some of them still in the last uh some of them on the beat some of them alive some of them that\nI'm On we investigate to try and work out why this funding happened in this case it's it's a very different picture\nOf what we've seen is over the course of the last six weeks we've had a an an increasing incidence of I'm a very unusual species that's being washing up a light from the sort of the the go away by an island all the rights of the top of Scotland\nUm so it stays taken us a while to put the pieces together these animals are not alive um they've been dead for for several weeks at sea um but it's very unusual to to get any of these animals coming on TALK shows\nHow many in a normal year would you see and how many of you've seen this year [noise]\nSo in a usual yeah um we would get probably between three and four animals in Scotland of this particular species a it's a ... it's a it's quite a cryptic species we now she by little about these these class substitutions\nUm and this year so far um we've had sixty eight to these animals that have been washed up I'm On the shores of islands Northern Ireland in Scotland and forty five alone in ... which\nIs [noise] they live very deep and the water than they do what\nIs [noise] they live very deep and the ... the the ... so what do you think what what is it what is it possible speculate might be happening [noise]\nWell this is what makes this quite tricky because they um they as you say that the species that live well off the shelf hedge so they they inhabit deep ocean trenches they can they held the record for both the deepest and the longest dive of any any animal\nUm they've been ... to just under three kilometers down and they can spend up to two hours down the\nThe reason they go into the the the such extreme environments just because that's where they can find that food which is a squid\nAnd um these these ... to a a there's a large number of them off the off the shelf age so this is the normal habitat for this species\nI'm now ... there's the problem is is that when these animals wash your shoulders by limited amounts of pathology that we can divide from from them because it in such a expensive states the decomposition\nHowever we are I'm aware that this particular species is particularly sensitive to I'm underwater noise um human generate an underwater noise in an in specific effect to mid range segment on\nOn that something that we would want to try and establish whether or not with any particular activities going on off the shelf age I'm In the last a couple of months that put a lot of this this this noise in the million and bottom\nAny ideas because you know humans haven't been quiet and the seat for quite a long time that something like this should be happening now seems remarkable\nIndeed doesn't mean we we've we've made the oceans of I noisy place and I'm not so that sense of the general problem in this specific case\nFor them we have is is that this out of the people that all the lights the mid writing sign all off in the military and loving information from than can be quite challenging um the reason that the military all flights a an a sudden all this frequencies is that it's used for\nUm the reason that the military health writes a an a sudden all this frequencies is that it's used for um communication and social useful locating underwater objects such submarines\nSo I'm obviously this is this is sensitive national security level so trying to get the information as to whether they'd be an operation can be challenging however what we hope to be able to do is to establish whether or not they face\nA noise is a plausible reason that these animals taunted so we want to let all the other things that could potentially have caused them to ...
