doing so they hope to reduce what they see as a failed system with a more\nShouldn't framework instead and in doing so they hope to reduce what they see as a failed system with a more effective if the one that keeps drugs out of the hands of miners\nProfits out of the hands of criminals and and would reduce it some of the health and social harms that they've seen with the drug use and you talk about strict controls set of regulations will still be in place then\nWell just briefly what it looks like what is legal federally 'cause it's a bit of a patchwork across the country depending on the province the federally an adult so that's about Eighteen or Nineteen years old depending on where you are\nWill be able to purchase from a licensed producer\nAnd possess thirty grams of the drug and dried form or its equivalent in Cedar oil form and you'll be able to use it again it's a bit of a patchwork same someplace and you'll just be able to use it in a private residence and others like Ontario for example ... most\nPopulous province you can use it offends the the same way you would if you were smoking cigarettes huge youth tobacco so that's roughly what it looks like now\nIt is regulated so a you have to buy it from a license producer it's still illegal to buy it on the black market\nTo possess over thirty grams there actually some new and fractions around selling minors which carry a charge up to fourteen years in prison now of course the Canadian Medical Association journal called it a national uncontrolled experiment not everybody is thrilled with this development older\nNot everybody is thrilled a lot of especially health organizations health groups\nPutting out press releases urging a lot of caution so there was that organization that you noted an organization representing psychiatrists warning about use of the drug\nFor people under twenty five so their concerns around developing brains issues around mental health a society representing gynecologist an obstetrician saying there was a growing body of evidence that there was risk of using the drug among pregnant women concerned about the development of the fetus so again\nBoth organizations were saying be cautious make smart decisions now we're hearing a lot about a green rush up on all the possible boon to the coast\nAnd now we're hearing a lot about a green rush about the possible boon to the economy that this development could have water people thinking about that in the months up to legalization here in\nCanada I mean one of the headlines that you saw almost every day it was just talking about the stock prices of some of these big license producers just rising and rising and rising a lot of speculation a lot of people really interested in joining this legal market to give you an idea Canada statistics agency it's national agency\nCrunch some numbers they tried to figure out how many people used it what kind of market there was an aide twenty Seventeen they found that Canadians used or spent rather\nAbout five point seven billion dollars on candidates\nMost of that was in the black market so that just gives you a rough idea\nAnd of course because Canada is doing this and it's a it's amongst the first to do it all the countries will be watching very closely they absolutely ... and across the world\nThere's just been a bit of a shift around the attitude towards marijuana we're seeing obviously\nCanada is taking a very big step of the kind of a bold step I Would say and it is an experiment into this full legalization model but a lot of in the U.S of course a lot of states were ahead of us in terms of legalizing the drug on the state level it remains illegal federally in the United states\nAnd we're seeing other countries bringing on line medical marijuana frameworks for seeing other countries looking decriminalization so having this experiment in Quetta seeing whether or not the Trudeau government\nIs able to realize the goals they put forward and if that is a successful thing I think there may be you know obviously other countries looking at that and seeing how that plays out\nAlmost Jessica Murphy in Canada and that's it from

relate to the body landscape thinking of space is not just as things we go through but actually the particles were breathing that\nAffects our constellation the way we are it affects the way we think looking at trees observing the landscape and I think that we stop the work\nIt's the connection with the work with the body with the elements the invisible don't tangible to an end that way you can actually bring things together and make us think about how we're leaving in the space in this environment\nToo long you been described as an ounce his to expose the link between the west everyday luxuries with the detrimental environmental impact on African ...\nEvery day luxuries we did that to mention environmental impact on African ...\nWell I think I Would go farther than that not only thinking about the west or thinking about the um African countries I'm from the African continent I'm Nigerian\nHe'd be bill but I've lived in different places and I've traveled to different parts of the world once you start realizing that once you take something from one place and put it in another place\nThat you're actually shifting materials you actually change in the constellation of that space so we can think of the Emirates we can take up to fire we can think of\nThe skyscrapers I mean can you imagine that a lot of Saddam has been taken out of the grounds\nTo be able to make locks we can then imagine how much time do we have used to be able to make that the relationship is not only about the west it's about different parts of the world and how we're working how we're shifting things from one place to another\nHow we're making wholes in other places and creating structures in other places and that also affects the erosion of that place it affects people moving from place to another so I think it's beyond the west\nIt's really talking about the movement the subterranean movement the visible movement the non visible movements between places how do you make visible through the you what I can give an example of a war called impulse you took bling which was actually worked I I I first went to Namibia\nAnd followed the railroads and a colonial quest\nOf that period so early twentieth century and how materials like compile was taken out\nThe minerals were taken out of the some of my mind and the work is a constellation of twenty nine tables also top histories and it shows different processes that shows materials in transformation so we can you imagine my cut transforming into isolation pods for\nBecause it shows materials in transformation so we can you imagine my cut transforming into isolation pods for ... ah for cars for I ends we can then look at the work in a circular way so turn around the work and it's an installation peace\nOr the other works like the way to cause which is a tapestry peace where you have two bodies\nPulling and on fighting with a structure and in that structure you would have images of holes of mind areas of cracks and the work is called ... causes really thinking of what the legacies that we have to reconstruct and that we have to reshape to be able to propose something for the future\nAspect of my work would be to use poetry as a way of thinking can think of the work that I showed it was a piece off future will be certainly fractured malleable stressed to sudden tension and will we be able to handle that stress\nOn tips on what was your reaction to the knees and the United nations that we have just twelve yeas to prevent catastrophic climate change uh when I heard\nThat actually I I started laughing because it seemed quite a short time um when we think of it twelve years and meanwhile the policies and the structures of the laws are not aligned to be able to change things so quickly\nWe were told that we need unprecedented changes to society and the way we need to think that will happen if the next decade\nWell it's very hard to say I'm an artist [laughter]\nYou're trying to you and your Oh yes\nDefinitely I think it might need that certain events and such an manifestations can take place in certain places for people to understand how urgent it is\nIf a stations can take place in certain places for people to understand how urgent it is\nAnd how important it is to rethink the way we are extracting how we are working with our landscape and how that is affecting every single being every single element\nOn the planet and I think once we do not feel it at our doorstep spent it's harder to understand how all the places are going through extreme change or extreme damages through the

but one business he's trying to show that you can transform farming in developing countries with much simpler phones\nWe from is this social network for farmers in Kenya and Uganda with plans to expand elsewhere in Africa and Asia\nIt depends entirely on text messages which the farmers used to see can share advice and he's just signed up its millions member I spoke to ... founder and chief executive Kenny you and I asked him what kind of people used it\nI guess their primary level we're targeting people here don't have those other ways of communicating with each other or so roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia who have no connection to the Internet and therefore a massive information gap of finding\nA information knowledge and how to improve their farmer or a bottle of disease or so we farm or we enable those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture in just about any local language for free or get spoke content back or even off line so using a an SMS message\nSo that technology is very simple technology it's SMS does does that what will\nSo it's it's simple in the front and a son that's a mess is obviously a hundred and sixty ... it's a very simple information format but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get get confidence people in such a simple format\nOr so when a former U.S as a question for example on on SMS we don't use machine learning and any I to understand everything\nOn SMS we don't use machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is their intent of the question where are they order the farming and essentially use that analysis too much them to ... you know three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question and getting up his book content back to the original farmer\nNow you've you've gone to a million members I think you just signed up a million the million member ...\nWeren't evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people [noise]\nYeah so it would pass a million which is obviously a great milestone for us having to one point to a million I'm I mean I think that the force than biggest uh indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it\nOr even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched um so uh by twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know it in context is is probably nearer seven or eight percent on Twitter\nUm you know we know protest more than a million questions and answers every single month\nOr which gives you an indication of the level of content that we find is necessarily a fund system to you is is not a social system its value for their businesses and people don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so I think that's probably the primary indicator that would say\nUh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand how they're using it and what sort of benefits from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally had information to help them save their their livelihoods and farms three we farm\nIt was an example of how it's been used a ... I mean the example I\nI Would give is that there's a a chicken farmer that I was using we farm in Kenya called ... he kept something in the region of of fifty chickens hum as and this was his entire livelihoods paid for his kids to go to school up at dinner and he finally table or on a diseases ... killed so you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days\nThe disease was ... killed you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days or any ask questions about this on we farm and go get information back a which vaccines to use it I just thought the disease spreading a managed to save the rest of east chickens um which is I mean that's that is the minds entire livelihood and that's that's the kind of vital\nYou know often seems to us fairly basic information but it incredibly fundamental to these farmers but we found is able to to to provide\nA Kenny you in from we from a Mona El sol from ... in a special guest uh\nUh that was one of those red now public a positive stories about social media or five years ago and one of those and we do is going to say the word was was a positive uses we've changed totally yes a\nDescendent of living was the year we celebrate in social media we thought let's go to the world ... ... people and other return regimes to move to towards democracy to mobilize masses\nIt was the voice of opposition but this was in ... near where government and regimes weren't involved in these platforms it was a platform only for activist real people are very very few\nPeople doing practical things like that yeah ...\nExactly will use social campaigns to reach people over and it's about stuff but\nLater on we started moving to regimes and the bad guys as we can call going there and propagating to to their own benefit\nSo it's now a battle between two items the that the people people who want to have a voice and people who want to manipulate them so this is why we now we're talking about the negative effects however we cannot forget that social media still can connect people together so have many many many positive effects but\nOf course the propaganda against the highlight of the time\nUh I mean ... ...\nBut of course the perfect and that gets to highlight all the time\nUh I mean ... still very important um I Am an eighties eighties connecting people in positive ways as well or is it do you have a kind of overall view of whether we are getting more good than bad from it\n[noise] uh we're still getting good but we are getting better now in the last seven maybe seven years ago I Would have ... we're getting old man good but now we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe can't take over if we couldn't control it's ... it's it's under control maybe we'd done no\nOne very brief word from use every climbing I used to positive about social\nMedia [laughter] I think it gets a big kicking and right and you say that I think that's another good that comes out but it's not I for one another\nThat's all we've got time for anything on a positive ... thanks to my special guest Mona El ... from the ...

include the voices of America's white working class who believe they've been abandoned by traditional political candidates\nSo as the U. S. midterms approach to look at the identity politics of left and right and their impact on democracy on a panel this week in the studio with me here Adrian pops professor of politics the University of Kent\nNine or drive a novelist and journalist ... ... lecture on government at Harvard University in Cambridge being bother Gopal electorate in English at Cambridge University welcome to you all I'd like to begin by all the each of you will seize identity politics will do you mean by it Priya\nIdentity politics is I think ... to ... that has been given and is used to describe\nClaims for civil rights claims to full citizenship and claims to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat pejorative term which has been given to demonstrably quality and full citizenship and to social justice and I I'm not happy with him because I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and not have less to do an identity often than with questions of justice\nWe can talk about that little bit more Adrian past what does it mean to you that's politics is really about individualized warrants the individuals are small groups\nThis is really about individualized I didn't see individuals are small groups very often so cool my knowledge ease that's how I ... for quality and inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevated of a commonality that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities in and countries so there's a problem I think in that it's a response individual lives and but I think it's an individualized response rather than a more communal collective Islam\nYeah ... you know to me I didn't do politics his crops two very different phenomena that going on at the same time it's a lot of confusion stems from mixing goes up so I'm the one hand what we're seeing at the moment is\nA lot of a minority groups claiming equality came in riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nAs sort of movements but as Adrian just said I sort of trying to re send to the basis of liberal democracy from being about individuals to being ... about groups has ... elements of the state line of trying to [noise]\nThink the term cohere as around the ideas that we are defined by our power relationships and that who we are is primarily dictated by groups into which we were born in that way I regarded as anti individual for ma'am part\nJust about any group that I was born into female American what have you I Would like out of that is I find it can find it in and my idea of\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you're a venue ethnicity or any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nDial real victims those real oppression exploitation\nBy the way to go over that is to name it as an injustice die affects everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always a ... of what we have in common\nBye Let's human dignity so it's always a painting to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... that\nThat doesn't ask to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your passion was an offense against humanity many people would have some you know recognize the events exactly in fact what\nThe tea movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what happened was actually one and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit with them will justify it would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big thick\nA very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin Americans than a comedian who falls enough with a white um hockey gold and sort of dramatic life story they have no partners\nUm I was amazed by the way in which bed movie which tells in a mainstream romantic comedy a story of interracial marriage\nStarted to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't that problematic that this round protecting this has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden the in that debate the ride was saying who has if you find somebody who he was enough\nWho cares if you find somebody who was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and it was possible left\nBut some afford if it was problematic exercise leaving me\nIs the crux of disagreement about what society one because I went to society where the moon to racial marriage with us more contact between cultures Robin where everybody has to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation though I knew the picture and in a movie of interracial relationships is probably my identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up\nI find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... like a kind of cheesy\nA wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left all my life who isn't for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheet about all falling in love and living happily ever after moving we caught stone politics into a kind of button all Hollywood wrong call\nModel I Will do for you and 'cause he wants to come into the air I think on the issue of algae Beatty rights and the way that's changed but feel free to comment on what pre as well I think\nThe what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not\nVenture off even buy a millimeter and that's a turnoff\nAnd that's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful illness on a an an ordinary social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and uh you know if you're at a party\nAnd there is somebody across the room you're white person there is a someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani but you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong\nBecause you might use the wrong word me might express something that's a little you know not all perfect there's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful\nAdrian it's the intolerance outline will just mentioned it's also political correctness on old pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow to differences defined as more than the ... not too close to a real differences out than to be celebrated\nBut they also the coming out and she's a real we all citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest I'm off even those notions of citizenship and humanity of calls contested there's no sense of of a consensus and they shouldn't be warm\nBut the moment we simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's I think that politics has become\nDo you have ... I I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I put a\nSo do you live ... I I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I hadn't ringing about authoritarianism and\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example of the only example that was given was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo so let me give you a couple of examples the first one I Want to make clear but I think a black lives matter in many ways is an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to our understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument but in fact I've met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and the business or a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers are those are true but the majority of the people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the relatively small ... off the oval American population but as black so I think actually was conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to be a few cases if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is a particularly deepen justice but you know what if you're a teenager\nOr a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually there's two white people who got shot by the police as well I Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this health ... people have never lived in multicultural multi religious monolingual\nStates this is new new situation that we find ourselves in why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian one\nReasons why I think it's just 'cause I guess is because a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between\nSince that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society and the middle of the function fiscal policies trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and Ken situations in the communities are not working and I think that's why people feel\nThis was a sense of powerlessness as a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with the center than Tuesdays by definition exclusive\nBriefly ...\nI think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier uh yeah ...\nWell it's nice to disagree with premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a more ethnic mono called hotel conception of themselves and find God who started to challenge that and we now live in society so much for most people embrace the idea of it the more to the mix was hard to use the vet if something has talked quite new Korea\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which that addressing inequality and the upsets around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that\nWay by is minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called identity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for any quality and suffering\nOkay pledged to think about that thank you for ... panel grandfather Gopal yes among Lionel Shriver in Adrian pops we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let his day what you think of the program or any ideas the topics she likes to look into you can email us that the real story at BBC\nAny ideas the topics she likes to look into you can email us at the real story at BBC don't care to UK or treat me ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to just such a BBC the real story in your poll cost up [noise]\nDistribution of service from the U.S has made possible by the American public media producer and distributor of award winning public radio contact a piano American public meetings with support from the financial services firm of Raymond dreams offering personalized wealth management advice capital markets expertise\nWith a commitment to put in clients' financial needs first more Raymond James dog [laughter]\nGood morning as his gay you win our eighty eight point seven\n'kay on ours broadcaster made possible by a generous grant from the EL cord foundation in memory of E.

I'm white time working class I'm Jim and I do feel happy and his biggest space people pushing themselves into those\nI think now because the mainstream parties on offering something that's inclusive and off they still stand for you know a consensus I've felt people economically and culturally and I do agree with ... of course to work in ... in the Washington lots of other components of the of the working tops have suffered an often suffered more than the white working class but saying the other people who suffer more\nAnd suffered more than the white working class but saying the other people have suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide also you know we'll rebelled against the status quo and and who are we to tell them to somehow that identity methods less than ... praying I'm not saying you did what I'm saying is\nThe idea that somehow we can just say\nWe only have a look at the most depressed people that are the only ones that math un in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not to watch the Persian Gulf in a rational utility maximizing preaches we are people who are involved each\nWe have people embedded in relationships institutions are not since feelings do methane is angel longing belonging to place to people to communities and countries masses we kind of feeling out of politics I only got are the\nObvious question that footage from that has been loaning ... onto wet and ease parts of the reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing ascend Saddam that longing that actually that that identity that was that the fool whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were well\nYou had a noted about how there are these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction\nDidn't or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact\nThat's a boring observation and northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tribe then they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on Nick durable\nIn some ways it was if you'll never end the remote the in India and you a pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India Hindu view of India it\nWins bodes well one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as\nAs a species break up into what are often very competitive clumps sorry I'm confused I\nThought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem but we've just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural tendency of people to especially when the larger amalgam\nIs just a bit too big to get your head around too\nYou're amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's a good politics happens because those tribes are bad but although tribes are okay\nI mean I'm very bad language singled out yeah I mean I think the question is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who as close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious ethnic group\nAnd the question is how do we deal with this in ... to the society in a productive manage\nA one on such which I've ... been quiet attracted to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen you look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response\nIs to try and domestic hated behalf wild feast of nationalism to try and claim it ... to make it inclusive to say that he's a high or a collective\nUh it is a level of the kingdom of looking at it states but obviously we fight for\nInclusion of all different groups under that common identity and how do you make that journey from being a cousin pulled us in a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots\nI'm ... I think patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know adopt a size of its history but it's\n... you know adopt a size of its history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots who love that country it's a question of mutual respect\nLike over ... bad anxiety saying that you love it how do you enjoy it isn't that are going to ... what's wrong and loving your country and its people accused other people of identity politics but I'm Glad you're national Zuma view opposed to nationalism I imagine you are and you know\nAs I'm your national thing making my country but I Know in my town and I said most\nOf Hindu majority of them so I look at nationalism\nThat's something that had served its purpose in the anti colonial struggle with today has become a very deeply dangerous beast\nWhat is the writer response will be the ... for it is the or the national Congress party but sad but we're all Indians are respective\nNow that he's not he's not true I mean it's not as though the older a form of nationalism the Congress party didn't have ... elements to it the one and then we'll do our days of areas of angry as well as the agent if\nIf I can bring you back then in a sense there there is a we we do seem to be making a distinction between bigger identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily so she could say well\nBecause I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more overarching can build a bridge you know we can be well 'cause we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause it's bound bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further the kind of cost\nIs bound bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further the kind of cosmopolitan also spoke about that can doesn't have to what can be a bit abstract I think the ... isn't that up so I think a lot of people feel European British or German or French but I also feel they have ... these layers of possible\nBut that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we managed to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here and the answer is that if everybody identifies primarily with the national ...\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu and Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live together productively in peace for the whereas if we've had our sense of collective pride at the level which coincides with the actual ... cents doesn't\nEverybody carry multiply and this was the last call on the edge of the nation between the identity is which you choose for yourself on the ones that have foisted the of course they do\nIn the uh people like ... like a Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way that I fight for the cause of\nPeople who have my identity is to emphasize oh common interest as Americans and other ... emphasize the ways in which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of the whole a member of the counter vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent\nAnd let's demonize any form of collective flowing above the level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a ...\nA bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British nationalism that led to breakfast at which is a big nationalism\nFalse distinction because one can argue that the version of British nationalism\nThat led to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on a painting by a sub nationalism that anything less nationalism the way the Brexit vote broke down there is a clear correlation between what you would call ... nationalism and British nationalism which led to breakfast and\nSo again either you know I don't think we can have the kind of those things that ranks that they went out and didn't have a ... in the new ... while\nI mean it it actually quite a lot of people in cars not did vote for breakfast I I personally am not expecting that majority ... right but but but I think what what you see here is different notions", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Reno", "day": "20"}
