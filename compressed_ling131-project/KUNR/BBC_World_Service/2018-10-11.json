age to a\n... who may one right woo to win or ice in the form of with what you find on asteroids that was the first talk it used to be about\nYou know water is very likely the catalyst to opening up the space age for for you and I the water can in the form of age to hydrogen and oxygen be split and made into rocket fuel it's the field and rockets right on right now so the ability to take that rocket that guy from the surface of the earth to earth orbit\nAnd top it off and take it farther\nTop it off and take it farther a mixed that supply chain of a lot easier and a scalable to like qualities that we can't even imagine millions of people living and working in space instead of a half dozen\nI can get the idea here 'cause there'll be a potential set at a station in space for a gas station in space there will be busing spaceships will be great but I Do see a problem in the in the in the medium to show the because\nWe talked about economics rockets and now going up and down from us fall cheaper than they used to run I mean the cost of fuel as a proportion of a\nAn eleven month SpaceX rocket kind of shoot him spaces is actually only a tiny fraction of the costs of the overall mission so he's he's a few really the deliverable that everyone is waiting\nFor absolutely what we will find over time is this very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the earth just into space into earth orbit\nAnd from that point we'll have a different type of vehicle your your taxi or your tie that never has to feel the weight of gravity never has to feel the force of the atmosphere it'll be permanent ... in Italy permanently in space and it'll it'll be that shuttle that takes you from where the rocket drop you off to the next point\nAnd sometimes you don't feel that shuttled from the surface of the earth but maybe when that show gets out two GS secrets were bitter farther out from the moon you'll feel that with a resources from asteroids and you're going to need us\nThings colony first I mean or at least ... and I actually from sort of industry on a ... a a population of that or or some kind of infrastructure before you can even begin to start arguing for the benefits of space\nCan even begin to start arguing for the benefits of space mining\nWell this is what is the challenge and the business of space is the chicken and the egg yeah what is the series of stepping stones that that is sustainable you get this going so you have to like you said make the economics of it\nIt so happens that these economics are kind of the economics of large industrial projects uh their multibillion dollar projects\nDecades in length but a similarly speaking they have the opportunity for a hundreds of billions of not trillions of dollars in revenue and value creation and it's it's kind of thinking about we make computers so cheap probably never going to make money on computers and of course there's not a part of our lives that are not touched by computers today\nSo a space is kind of a an an the next version of that\nQuick question if you you go you've got your asteroid and you'll sites and you go up and you land on it to prospect and you come back and go yes it's got all of the things we wanted to do in the late ... besides but it hasn't gone by then and there's not going to be back for several decades\nA that is one of the challenges of working with asteroids as opposed to the moon or Mars and this is part of the economics of space mining\nWe see similar challenges in remote activities in the tundra where the roads literally freeze over and you have to work with the seasons so with asteroids one of the challenges is to work with the seasons of their orbits so if it were easy it would already be done and these are the things that we're exploring to find the next solution for housing when this happened\nIt's happening now so you know you're going to have a pro bono starting to prospect on that particular restaurant the first commercial resource exploration mission is probably still four or five years away it's a matter of the ...\nStill four or five years away it's a matter of the funding for doing these things NASA does billion dollar missions the commercial sector still needs about a hundred million dollars to do these types of projects so it's a it's a financing challenge as many things are\nBut five years from now we can tell you which is the you know the first place in the solar system that will be the the source of the resources and you think the finances that yes absolutely hundred billion dollar projects are a dime a dozen around the world but uh five years away from knowing where the mine is and probably five years after that from starting the very first small scale money\n... here on business daily from the BBC\nLiving we discuss space tourists space factories mining even\nAutomated space refuse collection but where's the magic and all of this\nWhere
