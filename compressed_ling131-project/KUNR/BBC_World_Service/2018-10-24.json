a hundred percent behind or otherwise you weaken ... position parliamentary arithmetic has very tight and we ... we have to back up all the way to the point where I had been what will probably be the last minute hits\nWe end up with a deal which can determine our future relationship with the EU and make sure that we do know suffer the consequences that such a major uh described\nPoint of all this is that the prime minister is being manipulated by the almost impossible pressures inside Iran policy if one yeah if one looks at her positions on things like\nA Northern Ireland backstop which the British Government had signed up to this notion that they will always be a safety net whatever the status of a future trade agreement between the u._k. and the you they will always be a safety net which ensures that Northern Ireland and the Irish republican will not have a hard border between them that\nGuarantee offered by the British as long as your dollars last December now seems has been

...\nBut um she's a day being ducking waving I think a great quality is that ... is a unflappable and she doesn't get pushed around now there's no doubt\nThat every waking day the ... prime minister takes in the last thing coming file for many angles are mostly from those who wanted very heartbreaks over breakfast or no deal a tool\nBut she doesn't thoughts and what she's doing it she's saying very clearly that uh the union of the United kingdom the full conscious of the u._k. must be held together and that the peace process behind a Northern Ireland mustn't be interrupted by treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United kingdom\nNow she has stuck to that but the problem we've got to try and find a solution which square the circle between the principles of the youth and the principles of holding\nTogether at least ... square if I may interrupt just to because we are going to find ... minister Simon companies said yesterday that will be no withdrawal agreement without the Irish ... ... and ... story so all of this\nShuffling of papers and on different positions for different people in the end it's quite simple\nTheresa May is he a ... year position is here the breaks in tears who appear to have a a means to stop Theresa May from from making any more concessions to Brussels based it over here there is no way of making this work\nI think that will be a way and actually wants to analyze it I'm Simon cave and they use various mobbed and I'm a very thin line did essentially has the same objective as we do which is that we don't want to undermine the northern Irish peace process\nOne to undermine the northern Irish peace process we didn't want to ... border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the island of Ireland and that essentially sort of more or less is the ...\nBut the ... the point about Canada plus as it doesn't to address the problem is it's it's still a problem so you know people can argue amongst themselves and and adopt pollsters in positions that doesn't mean that the ones that come in any way they live at\nMorgan a former cabinet minister said the other day this policy the Tory party all politics is now on to quote existential strain friendships between colleagues have been irreparably damaged\nBecause all these bitter arguments\nOver bricks it the languages become toxic including talk of Brexit fears of killing his own is for the prime minister carrying on new into a meeting so she could hang on a cell phone ... nice being turned in her body what on us is going on inside your party\nBut I I think briefings using disgusting language like that that just to be condemned to today like quite agree that some people if you like a sense of decency and decorum is is getting out of control\nBut the point is your party giving the atmosphere the toxic poisonous culture within it now open bricks it cannot possibly deliver a cut here in Britain ... deal\nActually I think it can because I think that in the next few weeks is the prime minister gets a deal and comes back to parliament with adult chemistry of all this will will change and we will have a vote in parliament which I actually believe would vote for a deal and I think\nWhen I hang on this is interesting so your vision of a deal\nAnd I think when I hang on this is interesting so your vision of a deal it's a deal that she's done with the end you're twenty seven year old telling me it can get through the British Parliament but it won't have to support surely up some of the people I've just referred to with the language that using so presumably believing you can peel off\nSome members at least to the opposition Labour Party is that it\nNow I think we'll peel off a lot of that is making the noise against because I think in the end I'm In a it is probably will be the the the new deal that's on the\nTape and then we'll pay check as all of a sort of Italy which\nIs a that is my belief and I think we should then supported\nI don't see how your party can survive that your former boss well yeah it's I drink more Boris Jones and\nHe says ... is akin to a suicide vest being wrapped around\nThe British nation you'll respond so that was it's one of the most disgusting things I put it in ... in politics you said this is the end the Boris Johnson if it isn't now I Will make sure which is late so I put it to you that if you and people like Boris Johnson who used to work for ... with each other\nEven before this check his deal is put back on the table before parliament is the final deal with the Europe your policies\nFinish that because that that thought is was bigger than the events it has to cope with in the case of ... as much a journalist as he is a politician says sometimes he uses this floor it language and what was happening was that he was clearly intending to get into ... with a wish to undermine\nThe prime minister already you know at least it that now after finishing off and\nAnd that's all if you you couldn't fall or if it's a bar is back in ... in order to try and just get in to back off\nIs in order to try and just get in to back off I had to ... in the end actually that is what happened and I think the prime minister or we'll be able to deliver this I think talk or by people challenging to a much exaggerated\nFinal four if you are wrong if parliament rejects the bill it through the maid brings back\nFor you want the best option then is it a change of leader and the Tory party on a different kind of bill is it a general election or is it A People's are so cool people

upon them and to make it possible and that ain't going to happen at the moment but I think that if a deal will put to parliament and were were ... ... woods cools\nFollowed race around Seventy than anything we've been discussing today so you basically have no idea what would I mean does it would be we'd be getting it's a completely on into energy of what's happened and that's why I don't want it

Senate if it means that corporate tax got him there and that kind of an appeal is\nVery compelling for small dollar donors to see that their donations are not just important but that that the only thing that can help them when does this reflect\nThan a cynicism in American political culture a desperation to see somebody who is not taking money from the ...\nI think that's because there has just been assumption that it is very easy for a small number of people to donate a lot of money and then in effect by the government's\nWhat's better or working all the candidates that accept small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government that is elected only by people making small donations even campaign finance advocates going back to the Nineteen sixties\nThey said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office or on small dollar donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is\nActing corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is making a very big play to try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign power by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls and turn people out to vote\nSo this is being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because\nThe architect you wasn't bad for people to just play ... and make a quick to nation but also you're saying that the money is actually only parts of the strategy here it's almost like you get buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them\nIn terms of boots on the streets\nThat's exactly right they're making an emotional investment to a campaign and because better or is asking people to build a movement with him he can then asked them to knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable things that I think better or works campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are officially run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own offices and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of garages apartments\nFront lawns fats artificial intake points for people to come and volunteer and help turn out the vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system\nHe's having his volunteers and his supporters in effect running large parts of his campaign on their own and if he does when it was suddenly send the big message across Washington that's right what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can run the camp\nBetter was doing win or lose is showing that you can run the campaigns very differently than anyone else has thought possible and I think the true test of better works legacy will be how different democratic presidential candidates tried to emulate what he's doing won't see spending is thirty eight million plus on\nSo far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google on recruiting other donors and supporters\nWhen he was a it was a similar tactic approach by the Trump campaign was it not\nYes the two best spenders right now on digital\nExpenses are Donald Trump and better at work when you have better spending so much of his money on investing in a digital program that is something that is very unique and the Democrats are frankly catching up on to where the Republicans were last cycle\nBedroom real good causes current he lose including to the opinion polls by on a percentage points also do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising is a symptom of sentiment and Suzie as them do you think the polls are all\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in Texas of all university found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better or can turn out voters that are not being picked up in the polls can you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in\nAny traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sixth and I think that Beto O'Rourke is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWork is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here while the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney I'm watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial to the Republicans keeping them majority losing it\nBut despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way at them and\nGet out and vote in the mid term [noise]\nWhat do you I Am proud to ensure news are forty minutes president here of our country Donald J from [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major efforts Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one and anyway it is important to stress that well Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been best has stoked from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties they were old may end up being fairly even so how might this translates into success at the polls does the money even matter that much Donald Trump ... under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one\nMuch academic research I'm a recent us just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential and focus so how should campaigns be focusing should they be spending an online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government illegal studies through his Wesleyan Media project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nIs incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of them\nTo voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy advertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you're running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach\nOlder voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists\nOr what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nDoes TV advertising they'll work\nDoes work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction and so if you can out advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day of the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign you know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race all that much\nUh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early in campaigns so that they're not out\nThe arms race for why they spend so much money early in campaigns so that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of the euro viable campaign\nBut at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and they're not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage of the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race and you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend the last\nYou know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're gonna ... going to regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but ah votes as being absolutely bullets with the TV sports wherever they may be\nAbsolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things\nBut campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table and so voters in in competitive districts in states should expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio or in the next or in the next ten days\nProfessor of government Mike friends separate to oh this also talks political advertising we've been discussing we do wait to see I'm not a sense\nOf how much manipulation on line ... by trolls

BBC\n\nYou're listening to weld update from the BBC\nObsessive compulsive disorder is just that a mental health condition which the patient has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behavior is one of the most common types of those CD affecting nearly fifty percent of patients is severe contamination fears and excessive washing\nBut it's a conscious of not develop to not to help those with a complaint to take the form of video which enables the patient to watch themselves washing their hands or touching fake contaminated surfaces the BBC's Tom Field and it's been talking to use or\nYou can say that they are ready to say like when he wants to already just click on style and depending on what's your mood\nAnd all the food just answer those questions so the first thing you're you're off to raise your mood now how how tense your feet and yes so you have to radio so like how discussed at you for the right now how anxious you're once you're done with the questions that would be a video and this is tailored for you so it's a picture it it's a film of you washing your so gates myself washing\nMy own hands the way I wash every day [noise]\nI Do wash my hands quite often like for example if any for touch my mobile I feel like okay should I wash my hands before I eat anything because I was just touched my ...\nEven if I go to ... to make sure I wash my hands either by signing Kaiser or with a so so I keep on washing my hands a lot of times\nYou get the the dogs in between the U.S does come on the on the screen just to ensure like you're watching the video and are you how concentrate on your yes it it all you have any ... came up on the screen yeah and that brings you really\nYes it off to you how many circles came up on the screen yeah and that brings you really weren't paying attention and you are actually engaged in itself exactly and then it asks you how you feel after you've\nWatched yourself wash your hands and now how disgusted whole anxious you fail\nYes so it's also the same sort of questions to measure like is it better to watch them go do or was it was after watching we do\nAll your washing your hands as much as you were before the trial or or do you think it's had some sort of lost in effect\nIf I keep on watching videos of washing my own hands all the time the ... my mind I was like okay that's it using to wash your hands on so I can see a little bit different like okay I don't need to wash my hands so that's a\nWell I've been talking to professor Barbara Sahakian one of the developers solve the brain training at punt who's findings to the period in scientific reports\nMany of these people wash their hands so many times a day that they can damage than some of them get some extreme they put bleach on their hands\nAnd because they're worried about the contamination touching things that other people have touched maybe getting some disease sometimes they can't even leave their own house because they're worried that anything they touch\nWill you know a contaminate them\nI'm wants treatments currently exist so there's two main treatments one is cognitive behavioral therapy and it's a special for them it's called exposure and response prevention\nSo in that therapy they asked psychologists would actually ask you to sort of maybe ... around the edge of a toilet seat maybe even put your hands in the toilet and then they wouldn't let you\nYour hands in the toilet and then they wouldn't let you I'm going wash your hands so what happens is anxiety goes way up and these people as you can imagine because they're worried about this contamination\nBut eventually it subsides and when they can't wash their hands anymore they realize that actually there are right there's nothing wrong so it isn't effective treatment and many people but not for everybody and also as you can imagine many people don't want to undergo that treatment because it's too stressful\nFor them to do it and it causes too much anxiety\nAnother treatment is the selective serotonin ... uptake inhibitors these drugs\nThat are used also in the treatment of depression the ss arise drugs like Prozac but again I'm about forty percent of patients uh don't don't really get a good response to treatment\nBut yours you maintain your brain training app is more effective what's the thinking behind is well the thinking behind it\nWas the first of all off and when you have to do the CBP therapy you have to go into a specialized hospital I have to make an appointment it's expensive sometimes it's an inpatient treatment\nAnd that now with the new technology we should be able to use these new technologies for you know developments in the twenty first century I'm going to a meeting on those therapies for that at the world society and Academy of medical sciences\nAnd we should really use this new technology and get it into play and the idea behind it was well perhaps if you watch yourself washing your hands it will substitute for doing it yourself\nAnd the other one was to put something a kitten too\nAnd the other one was to put something akin to the cognitive behavioral treatment of exposure in response prevention on the app itself\nSo there were two different types of Aspen both seem to be effective actually\nSo you're getting the person to reflect if you'd like on the behavior yes so they they really when they look at the ... some of them said you know I I used to not be able to go on the bus but now I can go on the bus because if I get worried that have touched something I just can look at the\nUh myself washing my hands on the up and I feel fine I'm not anxious so stressed or anything like that\nAnd then with the other one um which is more akin to the sea Beatty therapy\nThey would say things like I used to be able to uh not be able to touch them been or use a cloth twice so used to have to throw it away if I was wiping account to but now I realize that actually there's nothing\nNothing wrong with using it twice rinsing it out or when I touched been I don't need to rush away and wash my hands so what sort of says has have you had those using this some brain training him so we have a certain measures of this kind of obsessive compulsive\nSymptoms and they will reduce by about Twenty one to twenty five percent\nSo that was a good reduction because they've only use the ... for one week so if they used it for longer it might even have a better effect but that was quite a good reduction\nAnd also it affects their ability to a\nCognitive abilities so they're not so rigid in their cognitive thinking anymore they're not so habitually they can sort of thinking more about goals that they want to achieve rather than these rituals and their obsessive thoughts [noise]\nThese rituals in their obsessive thoughts that was a protest and Barbara Sahakian not one very lucky person has reported to one of the law just to have the luxury jak poked in American history in a drawer last night\nIt and

willing to host a an and conduct\nAnd military a maritime exercises and joint drills so I think this is just an opportune time where they've all parties have seen that there's a necessity to have some sort of confidence building exercises and measures and they're taking each other up of a up on that offer\nBut the countries involved um has not given up the territorial claims you know the south China Sea\nNo they haven't so this is really I'm In a way it's it's putting that aside for now and that is a long term issue that that is not going to be solved in terms of deciding which features belong to whom\nAnd the hope is that at in the meantime at least these countries can come together learn from each other build some sort of trust a and make sure that if there's any sort of maritime emergency in the south China Sea they have a basis to worked with each other on it\nAnd is China's thinking that all these countries might come to look upon the United states has the common enemy\n[noise] um I think China um is certain\nUm I think China um is certainly worried about the position of the United states I'm In the south China Sea as one that is not going away as the one that will will continue to reinforce its bilateral multilateral relationships in that region\nUm but it is at the same time going to uh exercise it's its own efforts to try and build upon its own bilateral multilateral relationships there\nWe did we stand with some international jurisdiction international rulings on who owns walked in the south China Sea\nAnd we have no international ruling on who owns what in the south China Sea we have international ruling of course\nAs a result of the permanent court of arbitration finding in two thousand sixteen which are ruled on the nature of the features in the south China Sea and what type of maritime territory they had around them but they made no ruling whatsoever on the sovereignty of those features\nSo um it's still up for grabs is Bush was saying

not by ah like I said that sovereignty feature at us sovereignty issue is going to be an issue that these countries are are going to be working on in a very long timeframe\nSo China or the United

the the near collision that we saw recently uh between a Chinese and American ship\n'em was certainly worrying and and the United states have been reports that have come out of the United states saying that um they will step up exercises\nUm in the south China Sea that is likely to aggravate China but I think it's important to note that that neither China nor the United states are looking for war looking for conflict in that region that is hugely destabilizing\nUm and that is exactly what these types of of exercises in simulations are for um which is why we see this type of re engagement
