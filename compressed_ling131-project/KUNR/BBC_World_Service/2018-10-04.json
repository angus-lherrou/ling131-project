thousand moving parts for the patrol car\nWhich means they're ten times cheaper to maintain the cost of charging an electric vehicle is also ten times cheaper than the cost of fueling a federal car on a per mile bases\nAnd the last five hundred thousand miles as opposed to just a hundred and forty thousand miles for the federal car\nWhen you're older and you drive a car or a hundred thousand miles per year\nOver five years you need one electric vehicle or two and a half or three federal cars\nAnd then you take a driver out of the equation then the cost goes down further three or four times so you combine that on demand autonomous and electric and you get the ten times decrease in the cost\nThe satellite powerful arguments will say this is starting in twenty twenty on you know you say two three years away you're saying there's a storm coming if there was a storm coming we would see the beginnings of it now wouldn't William we don't ready just on the revolution that you describe happening\nWe do if you looked at the cost of an electric vehicle say that Tesla Model S was a hundred thousand dollars just in two thousand and fourteen and now you can buy a Tesla model free for fifty thousand dollars so it's come down by half\nEssentially they're going to be cheaper than buying a Petra car by about twenty twenty for half the market and essentially by all of the market by about twenty twenty five now car companies are getting it\nTwenty twenty five now car companies are getting it after denial for the last few years they're all announcing that they're investing tens of

that's a ... and proving explanation in several countries are investing the regulatory from China\nFor instance there are many cities that are already investing in making self driving technology happen in their cities\nBut with autonomous vehicles that is not just about persuasive technology you need the public to be happy to see these vehicles on the road and it may take a long time before
