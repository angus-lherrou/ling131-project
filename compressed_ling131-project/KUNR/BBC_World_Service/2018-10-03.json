corruption agenda has defined a large part of this national election but other than it\nHas indeed and whoever is elected president is going to have a really tough time getting rid of corruption because there's a whole system that breed that and that starts in these little towns and then worked its way up\nSome of the things you need to understand about Brazil is Brazil has massive electoral districts so everyone in a while ago as are voting for the same legislators and in this case there's four hundred and forty different candidates that they're going to have to choose between for various positions\nKind of huge array of candidates combined with thirty five political parties means that elections are really expensive so there's a need for money in some cases from legitimate places and in other cases as the corruption investigations have shown over the past few years it come from outright graft\nIt seems almost impossible to anyone and to keep yourself playing\nSome of the politicians who have ended up wrapped in these corruption scandals say it's the system itself that requires that I think that's a bit of a cop out there have been movements to make elections cheaper\nTo reduce the number of parties and huge should ban corporate donations but what's really just\nTo reduce the number parties and huge ban corporate donations but what's really difficult to all of these reforms one that just I think Congress they encounter massive resistance from the politicians because of course that quite like this and that kept them in power for so many years and it's really hard for\nA reform minded congressman or president as I think when the when the election it over to really change the way that politics work and the role of money in politics and develop\nSarah

T. he's the anti workers' party\nAnd that has resonated with a lot of people who have become repulsed by the workers' party because of everything that's happened in the last few years\nWhen it gets you know we do have Komen's than we've from those representing the anti corruption drive saying\nNo matter what the politicians say they're not going to derail the judicial efforts to clean up politics is too much of a girl is roots grooms will do be too much of an outcry from ordinary working people if whoever it is who won the election was to try to derail what's going on\nThey're starting to be a level of fatigue in a way with the sheer amount of corruption that this investigation has uncovered there are parts of the judiciary and Brazil that have become very politicized because the corruption operation\nOf the judiciary in Brazil that have become very politicized because the corruption operation the lives that operation\nHas uncovered so many different ties to so many different politicians\nSome of which do have links or connections to some members of the judiciary so anyone who tries to stop ... very visibly or attempts to do anything to stop the operation from continuing would probably encounter severe backlash from the population\nSo what's your expectation I mean taking your personal view do you do an optimist but doing business in the world of politicians can be separated at this corruption come to some extent we cleaned up and in the medium to\nYou never get rid of corruption completely but I Do think that over looking out to the medium term there will probably be less corruption in preview that's potentially a positive development\nAs you probably know there was over the weekend a very large women's march on Saturday to protest\n... the next day there was another very large march across the country pro both found out also protesting the P.

off\nAnd the reason for doing this because we remember those protests are lots of very fearful of wives of men who had passed away as saying that all men don't live long enough to get the benefit of the pension\nThat's right I mean specifically the problem is about Russia and men are rushing women life expectancy is relatively high but for men as he mentioned it around about sixty seven a nationwide as an average that raising the pension age to sixty five is that pretty significant leap a given that the life expectancy is is that still on particularly given that many reached\nThe life expectancy is is so low still I'm particularly given that many regions of Russia especially in the east it's not too far below sixty five so\nFor many people this is really a problematic law and

the people and how President Putin described that is that basically fewer pensions pensioners means higher pensions\nAnd he's saying that the current system is not sustainable but the system will eventually be better\nAnd she's still pretty popular compared to many it'd be just around the world is knew\nWhat he is but you know it's interesting just to watch his writings because if you look
