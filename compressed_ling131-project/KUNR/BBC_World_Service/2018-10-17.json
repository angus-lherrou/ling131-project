today was also meant to be a big moment when the deal was finally done\nThere is a big stumbling block though what to do with Britain's only land border with Europe that's between Northern Ireland which is part of Britain and the republic of Ireland Donald Tusk the president of the European Council says the goodwill is there but he wants to British prime minister Theresa May to come up to the table with new facts\nOf a senior people arriving a summit amongst those speaking as they entered was the French\nPeople arriving at the summit amongst those speaking as they entered was the French

you to fold 'em there's talk about the issue in white is such a big stumbling block Catherine bomb out as a senior research fellow\nOf the nonpartisan research group UK changing Europe she is professor of a new law so very well qualified at Cambridge University here's a guide to why the Irish border issue is such a sticking point\nThere is a binary choice and that says you have a harmful to in Northern Ireland\nBut that means that the u._k. is out to the customs union and can negotiate the free trade deals oh we have no ... and it was announced that through the nose around in the south\nUm but that means we stay in some form of customs arrangement which means no trade deals 'cause the facts all that this is a binary choice said the real question is the new facts but it's actually a shift in political position and that's the problem and the moment to reason they has that she knew Rico room on\nShift in position and that's a real problem and they used to and if there is no deal done by the time tonight that much we will leave with no deal which most commentators believes will be pretty catastrophic for the u._k. come to me a no grades either for the you twenty seven particularly for armed\nI ask a legal opinion of water border becomes on the twenty ninth about because of the moment we say there's no ... well actually the ... because you've got different currency on one side of the boat or the other you go different tax\nThe ... because you've got different currency on one side of the border the legal different tax systems the different social services systems there is a kind of a border when people say no border they made the wrong check points there aren't horrible business that I grew up with in the Nineteen eighties seeing the militarization of the border and\nIt is that legal concept of border which might help on the side tried to ... pounds of this this kind of double bind that you've described\nIs really tricky the the real problem what's what's going on here is um the physical infrastructure on the boat and that's the issue because the moment you have any form of physical infrastructure\nAnd by that means cameras all security post anything of that so the real concern as it becomes a target of terrorist interest\nThe problem with Brandon Lucas [noise] we we say that it's a it's a huge game for I'd I don't play but I've heard of it how is it a global and a big money generator you don't you don't make any money playing it do you make any money buying it to play it\nWell you don't have to ... to pay any money to play the game of dominoes again I think that's one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy a thing called a season policy about maybe ten dollars and that gives you access to so cooler weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing\nUm but yeah it's not really a a money generating game in the sense we have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously lots of people have super into the game and willing to buy that season ... and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted on line there and why the company at the games is suing that player Brandon Lucas\nSo yes a brand new cars is accused of making\n... is accused of making these hacks to the game and selling them\nAnd these are enabled players to cheat bicycling so he's maybe ... ... does is it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim at them it does it for you automatically\nSo he's been sending these molds to the game online\nAnd for a upwards of two hundred pounds in some cases well again and people are buying those people are buying them yes because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas annoying for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is that essentially we're talking about hacking into the software or a Fortnite\nThat's why they basically accusing these papers copyright infringement and they're saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have ... essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one that surely at the games should be targeting everyone who\nDoes slow this is in fact because his argument is that he's being singled out he believed at some fat he says they're not some notes of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nUm and you know I think ... haven't been care about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps that trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will\nBe and it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nI Know if it's not even a fuss for food night radio ... yeah they they had some people arrested I think and I'm a ... this was a different game actually paranoid festival grounds\nThis is a different game

a lot of private companies\nHave their eye on this already and we got in first that it's a big companies that already um\nHad already set down a\nWith down Bruce than other parts of the world\nPut down roots in other parts of the world\nAnd I was the time zones move and midnight goes across the country or are we expecting the same sort of policy atmosphere and scenes that you'll see the\nWhole I Would I Would say some things John is a rather small city about a couple of hundred thousand people and saying this excitement tonight is it's quite amazing\nThough I Would imagine across the country if you look at larger cities but millions of people some of them are Canadians wanted this for very long time and uh when Justin Trudeau ran to be prime minister of the country\nHe promised people he would take 'em\nOf of of the illegal trade of the drug traffickers and um and regulated in an attempt to to grow an industry and I guess a lot of people in the world right now we're looking at Canada to see what Canada is going to do because Arab way is the only other country in the world\nHas a federal law that legalize cannabis the United states has done so in in a number of states and some countries have done is within safe but Canada is really a leader\nLot of people will be looking at houses\nOn hold it will not be with that was from the hip hop\nFrom law enforcement to actually\nWhether there is even enough marijuana\nThe one thing we've been hearing that the last number of days that they expect that demand will be so great in the beginning that a lot of the flyers are probably going to run out even within the first few days\nRight is it because it's such a stampede or the basically the country's gonna be smoked empty do you think\nWell exactly that's what it will be but some people will have\nTo take it and bring it home or take it in and looked at it private because it's governed by the same rules as alcohol or smoking\nThat's Chris O'Neal you H in St

the anger fools\nAbout those two power stations are pretty old no one was built in Nineteen Seventy two and one in Nineteen eighty two so this new project as well as the Jews are it's got six phases and we'll take moving\nIt's got six phases and we'll take more than ten years to complete compete it'll generate four thousand eight hundred megawatts of power now that's about the same amount of energy as three nuclear power stations China\nDoes the DR scene neater use that much\nWell I it doesn't but it means that the power supply in the deal she can be expanded way beyond the ten percent of the population who currently have reliable electricity supply\nWhich is of course great for economic growth and also be a boost for the country's ... province in the southeast this is where all the mining takes by some mining uses a great deal of energy\nAnd it also means for the deal is he can be a big power export to to the rest of Africa not just its neighbors but as far south of South Africa

batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now\nAnd then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be and what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and an upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery\nAnd then upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in the ... that can absolutely you're thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where you'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of these start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you\nFly across New York or London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe to worry about maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board\nThere is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the piloted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric powered trains like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types than\nTo play and the diversity of aircraft types than grows\nWe took about taxes I think that the tax is going to be picking me up from a and then my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably isn't the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think is the most traffic chided cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been also they have perhaps low regulations that that they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the self Paulo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on top of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something that's theoretical it actually already exists in one city\nBusy business people five to ten times a year and we all find ourselves in the cities where\nOkay my flight was late getting in I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there are now on those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere it's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic huh\nIt's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic how soon\nAre we going to see this revolution you're describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and all caviar by ... that saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus and less like a taxi\nOr going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport\nTwo two or three of the major business centers around the city so that you've you've started to deliver this rap and transportation option\nAnd then it just starts to grow from there\n... botch of vertigo arrow hair on business day from the BBC\nThe really for the new tech will be when these flying drones but come on just a novelty play thing for rushed overpaid business executives but when they also are a viable option for ordinary people that you will meet\nAll some Seventy or eighty stocks opposite battling to develop the hardware and ride sharing tech but I'm\nAlso is investing millions of dollars in infrastructure in lobbying Steve tape it says there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future transport model as well\nMean they're doing a great job in galvanizing the industry employing everybody together to go after a common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is well it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but brilliant but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's gonna be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money too\nYou're gonna be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things in simply finding places in big cities to land I guess but it's going to start in Europe and America what was going to start somewhere else from about ... the regulatory hurdles a less high\nYeah I think ... probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right it's water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and uh it just a natural fit\nYeah a lot of islands to jump over about ... less dangerous for that reason because you're not going to crash onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight you over the water most of the time but you know if you look around the world a lot of a lot of the most popular city to live in our water bound so there's an application for this type of transportation\n... besides it's hyping top pilots flying taxis and a number of western cities Los Angeles Dallas new Paris\nAs soon as twenty twenty five but it's not actually unrealistic sheds you'll give them the technical and psychological obstacles we're gonna have to overcome a professor Steve right from the university the west of that list is the worry first time we have an accident which can be attributed to machine\nAs you can imagine people kind of release their mind to face\nAnd say we're getting very very carefully because one major accident and they could shut this down in an afternoon it's a real worry and that's providing pulls facility for us in the industry back in the seventies I think they used to be\nA helicopter taxi service operating around New York and then I flipped over and killed ... people and\nThey not really done it since I have a oh what's the Pan Am\nKilled along with other people and they're not really done it since I have a oh what's the Pan Am building wasn't the weather's a helicopter crash that that was coup I guess in say again we have problems in developing these these technologies but oddly enough this is\nOne area in which the technology actually solve the problem we've had in the past\nI think the the ... that will pay an easing in period we the public needs to get used to the idea to just in the same way that we had the the the person walking in front of the car waving a red flag whether that's\nWhether that is I ever actually happened that day that was the early days of ... and early days it makes it makes the vehicles exactly\nWe are a faithful law and we need to get used to ideas and so once it's seen to be Paul solve our everyday lives\nAnd this is what's possible with this new technology people will accept it how long will it be how long will it take to we get to some kind of drugs and drug have\nBought taxi I but I Would love to say I mean this is this is the question everybody asks me my particular hunch timescales is ten to Fifteen Years\nNow the thing is I'd love to be proved wrong in this case because I really will my flying or I really want by flying taxi\nBut the number of weeks we've got to end should jump through as well in order to make sure this equipment is demonstrably safe that will take time in the in the sense that we read and just now deciding which groups we do need to jump through\nOf aerospace engineering
