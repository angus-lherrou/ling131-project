hunter [noise]\nWe don't really understand the story without getting to know the woman at the heart of it a name is Anna ... you\nMight say that\nI think and I'm like giving a set of what if\nI Know he's a self described activists who originally published demand spreading video on YouTube so what do we know about how we look at her social media accounts tells us that she's based in St Petersburg

because all of my previous tweets before that are where the tweets of obviously not a high schooler\nRoom\nHaving followed dozens of Russian troll accounts having studied that behaves yet ... isn't a great position to tell us what information wolf that looks like in real life\nAnd it turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of these men spreading video\nReally really fits it it's almost\nReally really fits it'd almost perfect example of the pattern that you see\nThese Russian trolls or the Russians on social media to take over and over and over again they're going to either create or take a piece of\nControversial material they're going to release it onto their state funded media social media platforms\nAnd then they're going to start talking about that piece of information and you'll see them\nJump onto like Youtube video and they will run commentary talking about in this case it would be anti social justice warriors and then they would also come in with the pros social justice warrior accounts\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nThat's right let me put it in these times meant spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it and as we do provoked very strong feminist and anti feminist responses\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on a social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats pornographic images et cetera\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context of politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics all my\nSay that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked\n[noise]\nThat would count myself as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged with the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat's dumped a molten ... he's a research fellow at the center for digital future at University of Southern California but more importantly he's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the un yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of an evil and good and balance\nWhen Star Wars the last Jedi I came out last year some sounds to key issue with the casting choices you seat never before I had a star wars film had so many women in ethnically diverse ... prominent roles and fish is gone some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at director Ryan jumps and\nSome of them executed behavior that look a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc\nAnd out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia there were sixteen out of nine hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit\nI'm thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been around for at least you know a number of years and the Russian trolls have been sort of themselves and American discourse on line for a number of years and all kinds of situations\nAt the states you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before an election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kinda have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that as Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's\nSomething else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer tactic that's the kind of idea just a generally destabilize the harmony that normally exists between people so that the nation is just not coming together at all\nLet's stick to digest that it's not the divisions haven't always existed in society to take the style was example whatever people's thoughts would about the costume choices than would always be some people who would agree and some who disagree\nBut if ... on rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives infiltrating the spaces and sending up the volume as each one of those disagreements and of course a fractured society as a society that struggles to take action\nAs Yoda says anger leads to hate and hate leads to that\nAction as your says anger leads\nTo hate hate leads to the dark side and I think that there's a lot of anger out there right now this is a tactic as old as war fanning the flames of anger and the populace as a very very easy way to start uprisings\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism\nThen what ... does is to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media in the context of conversations about the me too movement and so won\nThe ... is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments divvy do gets picked up by media around the world and uh because if you were so provocative\nIt's slowly bound to increase the divisions in societies that all well already divided\nIf you are sympathetic to on his points uh you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that are rabid conservative writers just spinning out of control\nOn the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias then divvied you will only ... in the strongest possible terms you're very likely to see it as an example of the senseless political correctness brigade in action [noise]\nTo the question that we raised at the beginning of the program Ken we conclusively ...\nTo the question that we raised at the beginning of the program can we conclusively say the N is video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ... campaign against this information suggesting\nIf you're looking for a smoking gun here then we don't have one but what we can say is that whatever the truth is this whole episode suddenly fits into a broader pattern one very similar to people studying the way Russia drives ...\nCampaigns but at the end of the day does that really matter does it matter to know whether or not and as video which raises a valid point I suppose is an act of propaganda\nWell I'm going to let John ... the Russian troll hunter we spoke to earlier on um sometimes\nMy real in goal here is to get people to be a little more conscious about\nWhat they decide to share on line and get people to maybe understand the sharing this piece of what looks to be\nOn verified information or this viral retreating is very viral tweet that confirms your political bias might not always be the greatest thing and to just take like a couple of minutes and look at what\nYou're getting ready to do before you do it\nSo as we said before think twice before you're ... or retreat

another special reports on America's opioid crisis on friday I spoke to keep him for his drug policy expert at Stanford University what could politicians on this a new legislation white has\nJust said drugs crisis in the U.S got that such momentum\nBut we have three waves of it so initially it starts due to poor regulation of pharmaceutical companies that make opioids\nWhich led to quadrupling of prescribing in the United states from the mid nineties for about Fifteen Years and that brought us to level like about six times per capita what you would see in Great Britain for example\nThe bad guys many people addicted to prescription opioids and then came the second wave was that heroin traffickers are reasons correctly that if they opened up shop in a lot of American towns where they had previously not had a presence\nThere would be able to convert a lot of people from opioid pills to heroin and they were right and so then that started our second phase\nAnd then most recently in the last five years or so has been the infiltration\nOf the heroin supply with fentanyl which is a synthetic opioid far more potent than heroin and that has turned a disaster into a catastrophe you know upper scale we haven't seen and drug policy and in several generations\nI mean what does tend to know and why it has become so popular among uses\nFentanyl is entirely synthetic opioids that means that does not drive from the opium poppy you can make\nNo is entirely synthetic opioids that means that does not drive from the opium poppy you can make it in a lab you can make it in your sink\nTherefore many people can produce it and at the moment the main producers are in China which has a large chemical industry in large pharmaceutical industry they're not tightly regulated\nAnd with the Internet they've been able to get markets where they sell directly to Americans and sometimes deliver a it here in our postal service\nAnd the other thing they've done is established links with Mexico where they deliver federal benefits blended into the heroin which is very appealing to heroin track or because now you have a drug you can make just as strong at at a much lower price than heroin cost and then that has been in Port in the U.S over the U.S Mexico border\nSo serious is the problem now in the United states the Democrats and Republicans have come together to back this legislation in an attempt to a ... ... one of the main ended up and solve that legislation\nProbably the first thing to note is it what is not there which is there's not an enormous amount of money the parties were far apart on that issue nonetheless they did find a lot of sensible policies that weren't expensive but are should be helpful things like\nA reimbursing the training of people who specializes in addiction having our Medicare program which is our program for senior citizens cover opioid addiction treatment which had not done up to that point\nOf supporting efforts to use a different insurance program called Medicaid for people who are in a jails and prisons because they're extremely high risk of overdose and so there's going to be demonstration projects where there'll be able to get access to health care before they leave prison and hopefully that will preserve their lives but there are many things like that that\nTogether I think will lead up to setting some lives even though this is not a transformative piece of legislation\nSetting some lives even though if there's not a transformative piece of legislation\nSo how we get a measure the success of this legislation would it be the reduction in the number of deaths from drug overdoses\nThat would certainly be a very good outcome although it's you know only one of multiple outcome that ad or\nBeing addicted to opioids is very hard and people's health and also just they're functioning in daily life in their ability to you know hold a job or succeed in school or just play an active part in their families so also be measuring\nThe prevalence of addiction in the country and then we're going to measure the prevalence of new addiction in other words if we're providing healthcare properly it's not just a matter of people who are already addicted\nSurviving we should stop creating as many addicted people as we have in prior years\nThat was a case I'm preserve drug policy expert at Stanford

China has compared the genomes of thirty two targets\nAnd concluded that there are six different subspecies the ... the ... the south China there's so much from the Indo Chinese and the Malay and\nWell this goes against recent research that concluded conservatively ... that were in fact only to wanting mainland Asia and one in Indonesia so what defines a subspecies several Christie is a tiger experts these do a logical society of London\nIn broad to this one criterion would feed it to different species would normally be capable of waiting to get a Saturday have to look different with the tigers while they almost logical differentiation Sinatra dismissed\nBut of breathing together they don't necessarily have to look different with the tigers while they almost logical differences ... sleeker a Moore's law joined ... obviously fluffy you\nYou can't rely on them I have seen for example some some out until I guess the ... law and relatively pile and really between what's currently regarded as Indian or the end I Chinese tiger it's really quite difficult to tell visually you kind of cool which differentiates we met at the genetics that doesn't necessarily mean that you should make a decision to manage them separately\nHe's thrown elements of each region or country wanting to have their I'm telling you\nThat is actually true yes the Indian tell like for example panther I talked with Tigris is\nAs whites currently ... she's found in India and they pulled the tone and Bangladesh and I've probably forgotten one but some at least in those four countries but the government to each country would like to regard it until I got as a particular unit\nI was at work so for a while back a twitch where people were discussing whether it's to her introduction of targeting tunnels and Cambodia and where we might take the soft targets from and I was there because of my background with tiger breeding programs to look and see if there were any cats have target populations that would be suitable\nBut in fact they really on their own ... acres and very few indict Chinese tigers in captivity certainly certainly not enough to generate animals for release and in terms of the habitats the habitat in that area was quite similar to the dry\nTropical forest in India so the international consultants that should just be that perhaps\nCould get targets from India where there are plenty and the Indians would be happy to help\nBut there was a feeling in the government that it's more appropriate to get tigers from your local environs and so you know that was a a conflicting viewpoints which can cause a problem\nGoing back to the issue of subspecies basically using this lady's research is by no means definitive\nNo I'd I don't think it's really makes it different just because of distinction can be found doesn't mean we should split into two groups the conservation national managed\nIt really makes it different just because the distinction can be found doesn't mean we should split into two groups the ... national management and the differences between tigers are relatively small I Would look always at the\n... adaptation to the habitat ... while you can afford to split but as soon as your population gets a bit too small to be able to manage it like that then you would think about using them together you need a pragmatic approach rather than a categorization one\nSo in that respect creating all these divisions does have implications in terms of conservation\nWell yes it can have her example agree with that nice recent evasion which to separate self what's now called the Malay until I got from the indict Chinese ... which is meant we've had to split the cat population into two pieces global captive population it's nice to touch luckily\nPretty much older than the light and one's right in the Malaysian zoos and most of the anti Chinese or elsewhere so it hasn't been a huge problem but if anything yes it causes difficulties and the management\nSo Christy a tiger expert from the zoological society of London not entirely convinced on that research thing that they're all six different subspecies up until I get\nDistribution

over\nTen suspicious packages were located at multiple locations in New York Maryland Florida Delaware and Los Angeles each package which collected by experts and examinations are now underway at the FBI lab in Quantico\nIs worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise we continue to advise the American public to remain vigilant as it does remain possible further packages had been or could be mailed\nWhen I speak now to our correspondent in New York's mayor Hussein who was listening to the press conference since the ... and the thing on a possible suspect\nNot yet and to be very honest the authorities were not really giving up too much information or because of the investigation is really still in its infancy\nAs we heard in that clip there were ten suspected packages they've all been transferred over to Quantico which is the FBI's location where they're going to be doing a lot of testing\nTo try and determine you know what markers exist on these bombs what the relationship is and then whether or not they can get any closer to finding out who is responsible\nNow there has been some earlier reports that they were focusing on Florida but the authorities at this press conference we're not going to talk about that at all um this is the the idea was that they were pap suspected that a lot of the devices were actually sent from there\nSuspected that a lot of the devices were actually sent from there with regards to any more threats you know at this press conference they said that they haven't had any more packages sent within the last eight hours\nUm but it still is important for people to be vigilant and the New York city police are also going to be vigilant and President Trump has been speaking about that\nIndeed he has been talking about um you know the need for calm and the need for unity as everyone has on both sides of the oil\nBut then he did take to Twitter to talk about the fake news media a common enemy for him I\nIt was a bit of a peculiar time to be bringing out his this enemy given that the CNN uh one of the media outlets that\nFrequently fee says his ... was actually the recipient of one of these packages but it really leads to a broader question about the political discourse in this country and just how divided it has become especially with the mid term elections just a few uh two weeks away\nOn what do you think the public's reaction to this is is it as you suggest like many things in America dividing on policy large well\nIf you look to the city of New York I'm I'm always amazed at how the city how resilient the city is and how it just sort of you know operates as a business is as usual in fact it really wasn't a big topic of conversation or on the streets of New York but within the larger context of\nYou know what this means for this election and the divisions that we've been seeing in this country are you know I think that we're just hearing more of it and you know normally you would see this kind of violence or attempt it\nNormally you would see this kind of violence or attempted violence were ... for for a violent to really elicit reactions from everyone saying this is wrong and of course you're hearing that but then there is a bit of a blame game happening and that is really falling on partisan lines\nThat's our correspondent in New York's America's saying when it's cold spring you old very light just hit on usa [noise]\nNow here in Britain a member of the house of lords has used his parliamentary privileged to name a businessman accused of bullying and sexually harassing staff has defying a cooled older\nMood hey you know identify the ... green one of the country's most high profile business figures speaking to the BBC load hating

guilty of unlawful sexual or racist\nThat suggested that I have been guilty of multiple sexual racist behavior I categorically and holy denying these allegations so what exactly oh non disclosure agreement NDA says they're sometimes known\nAnd they've been used by a number of high profile individuals I've been speaking to Suzanne McCoy a QC and the lawyer that for all\nThe studies agreements out policy of settlement agreement so settlement agreement would allow somebody to wave that I write and agree not to bring proceedings before an employment tribunal or civil cool\nGenerally in return
