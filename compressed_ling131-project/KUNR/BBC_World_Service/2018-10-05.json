you will I Want to begin by asking each of you how strong would you say a new ways green credentials carry it has with ...\nI Do believe that although we have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention was the\nVarious political parties have done the wreck several years transforming that the transportation sector that we have here in in Norway\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across Norway and that\nComing into and driving around all across the land that's something that that I Believe that we should be quite proud of can't Goodman says\nI agree last month a fifty percent of all new\nCars where electrical and that's a cost to a major leaked\nTowards a more green society\nEspecially when we know that the transport sector is a big country be thrown into the field to\nCredits yes so for me I I think it's very important that we have an active policy towards thinking new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives us the money to do all the research and have\nAll this ah green technology development\nGay Sunday is that I think that because of oil and gas we can't afford to be have a huge impact to make the climate better globally and we do the job abroad and we do a big drop inside no end up is because we have the money from oil and gas to do the job\nWe do a lot of things in the rain forest in ... we do look with the electrical cars you know way and that is a good thing\nAnd say ... from all the panels these green credentials that Christopher ... are you getting to agree I agree\nThis ... view that shed by much than a legion public that actually ... done\nYou should buy much of the Norwegian public that actually ... does this we do it well it's not say polluting when the power comes from Norway we take it up clean the from the ground\nWhere the good guys and all of us I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries are in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and the ... now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on importing fulfill funeral in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy investing in a lot of renewable energy\nAnd that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets\nTo which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as your concerns should the new ... new exploration licenses for oil and places like the ... seats in the ... I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and Main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to a new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the bar and see today they will be still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate\nThe twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate gets ... well I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on cold in the work\nBut it does not oil we're talking about well yeah\nBut my point is that if you have replaced coal plants with for example of gas or even oil\nThat will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener we first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway\nI have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah do\nYou separate Christopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron seat because actually it might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited have long ah county and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the tragedy we've had over a hundred and fifty exploration in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw on the ... when I was next incident and I came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said\nNo China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing\nAnd if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students at when I talk to them today and told them I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan\nTo get our fault that feels good selling\nStuff would look at the time frame\nBecause college but says well it could be doing until twenty Seventy yeah it will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based\nIf we go to do a big big job we do to increase renewables about six thousand percent another huge huge job ... on on how you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate target the Paris Agreement the target is that he lied to now where you smoked and we've been debating and those are\nThose numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built toughest new investments are being made into when you ...\nHow fast new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper than gas\nAnd oil in competition with the down as a politician and in a country like new way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green it's still difficult to sell this idea is\nHelena does anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in a way that it's become easy I've I've been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment then\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you think that well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves and I mean a lot of people has been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince the kind of\nTo look on what are our options with all the renewables for example\nWe are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable but where do you get the bio do so well uh you get to a perhaps if you're lucky from ah organic waste and it's part of the circle but uh if not you have to produce it by making\nSome of our lands part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making food\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and if you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that the\nTechnology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that the now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that the ... that's called actually knew now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green\nGay or at the same time we have to address CCS as his view because carbon capture and storage carbon capture and use it as both a central themes in the transition into but not one of which have successfully than no trial yet again\nIt's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things that we could use our universities for the ... from the burned sees like another new regions they stack them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold and it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere is a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we are\nWho wants to connect with CBS is definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway led effort political party actually agree on says well let's just explain what we need ... sorry it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take column for the environment and and put it away the underground all under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology ... it's a matter of making it profitable and ...\n... ... it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government in no way are shifting government so it's been quite a lot a lot of money to trying to make that happen there is\nGetting down to the details again and the south has been folks don't innovate for Twenty years I think we also need to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know\nWhat the harm is doing the climate changes if we're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please do less and they what you think the program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story at BBC dull casual UK

I think he would father study of renewable energy at our university which you can\nFurther than oil actually developed an you we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nGiven false none of this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the developments in the er and merit to him a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to hide the green shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expense and the a matter of time sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down the coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to think you may have yeah I Know but it's ... it it sounds like it does some ... some times when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well if you're going to have a gradual change you have to\nAbout a gradual change well if you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got the got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now and the energy sector is really happening and they just happening in other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds\nOf ... of it is a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely but my argument is that you will see now that you and you will and that will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWell that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much of Europe is generally grateful to buy new each gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls the way a little bit from Russia gave\nDoes it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian guys an older guys on board ducked terminal comes from the burns he comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes and ...\nSo this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than old not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she could argue that no agent energies plane as some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to lease powers that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn the parents said they have drilled about twice as much as Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily get that nor by goes to Brussels and love bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nYou ... that that is according to the carbon projects and if you see the current price has been originally seats to summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high in Europe gas will exclude cold if because of\nWhat you mean by that call them price\nThe price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy by\nAnd there's a market inside Europe and the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe to a low cost when those prices starting to rise then you guest will push out cold enough push health renewables\nAnd would have to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid they'll be able to carve uprising now but also the ...\nThey are afraid they'll be able to carve improving no but also the way the energy system works and since renewable energy is so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are they are\nCompeting and you mentioned Russia and the situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway can't we can't take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe in so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're going to keep exporting guests to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but but this is about what kind of view do we have for your past twenty fifty and Europe's committed to have\nCiro come get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector of the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with no way but it's a very poor country in the Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people ... the the way which treats citizens of the fact that he gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on [noise]\nIf it was on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a big ... the underpins this country that's going to keep it well see but with no way somehow lose some of its stasis is no way\nAfraid pots on some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you find\nGood you know you you you painting as far too short picture because no it was a will for states before the oil came\nNowhere made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we may develop a state long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast in Europe or the has the only place in Europe which hasn't been any comment during history because we're always has easy accessible proteins so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on and thank God we didn't have an ability\nWe we have a military and society in looking\nAt a lot at the history and one important objective that's had an incentive is supposed to keep the moderate pace of extraction\nAnd when they hit that limit that sat in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit triple production within Fifteen yet and then the tens yes afterwards the almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry is I Would say in many ways it's sort of became a troll independent states\nBut we also have this workforce that we can use for other purposes so I think tying ourselves to tightly to oil we should ...\n... but I guess I think what ... is somehow psychologically has it allowed no way to punch above its weight can\nI think we could just up the oil and gas tomorrow and it wouldn't have anything to do with our views on ourselves because\nThat means yours anyhow I mean we have we have a well for\nA state that's actually very clever because we have this big fund we use money from that\nBecause we have this big from we use money from ...\nTo pay for our running bills not from the oil and gas industry directly itself so for our everyday living and the for the political system for decided to solve it wouldn't have anything to do all of them of course we will lose future income but\nIt would be very very stupid because in the European Union in the world that through increased coal emissions because they would lose no reaching gas so that was my main points are now um [noise] so I'm back to that [laughter]\n\nVery good going into your welcome to museums the b._b._c. world subject which is called
