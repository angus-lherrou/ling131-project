source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized\nAnd that's why we go into politics because we want political recognition that\nA dignity we want the society to acknowledge that we are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender the ethnicity the race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that's propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years you recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't you know so did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nAh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us I suspect that she doesn't literally mean that\nAnd in that country away from us I suspect that she doesn't literally mean\nThe descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect it's something like you know we white Europeans are the real hundreds of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of the national community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know when I\nWas born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this is really an option for me\nNow that will be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like victim oil banning hungry who you mentioned in your book and like the alternatives to Germany movement that you also mentioned that will be loads of people who who listen to you and think\nWhat Californians view you know what a liberal Californian view your day mate has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and got all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live and de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to\nHave a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of being open to people or you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions\nAnd integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions collectively\n... and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you say her you know not California and that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIs a clear majority of people in the\nOne particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIf a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in the U.S\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that democracy is black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt is to see an action or and I don't I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's\nRobert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI it's um the Justice Department and\nI think that if he gets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now and I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts independence of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity they demand for dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics suit black\nYes it's really interesting isn't it because it's the talk of bites democracy and I think it's in some ways ... democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes\nBut like we've gotten middle ground that doesn't feel as if we've got to anything stable to stand on so I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that work together and work against each other in the same in the same set a sentence [noise]\nSo identity politics is really saw shifting sons in terms of where we place ourselves within that spectrum and everything that has a spectrum becomes really interesting when you look at either end of this extreme\nPeople gravitate towards the middle where we find\nUnhappiness with it and therefore won't say effectively how the freedom to go back to the extremes which then become uncomfortable and we moved to the middle so the modernization that constant brightening motion effectively in politics is really interesting do you have political beliefs F cell\nBased on your identity I'm not sure I Do a show with my identity is that it's a multi faceted and so my political beliefs\nBut I think this issue here is is really I'm very profound and I think a front says okay albertson's ... started the debate which I Hope will be grab by people more widely\nOne of the assumptions as being that I'm the end of history that doesn't western liberal democracy is the way forward we are not going to go any ... ... ... it's not going to go away\nWithout even though it's so new ... indeed and a history history tells us anything everything has a sell by date\nAnd if it is if we do think it's the best system that we need to understand it in ... and ... and change it to the manager will fashion the tension that's who spoke about essentially the tension between the value system of liberalism and\nBetween uh the value system of liberalism and the democracy bed which says a ordinary people decide what they want to know the value system a it is possible the system\nFrom which the ordinary people are often divorced ordinary people are the people that suffer economic deprivation most is that a few disenfranchised from the legal system and the power base and it is these these people that are hardest by extreme as politicians who are anti democratic it's in the longer term\nSo we do have a a big issue here which does need to be addressed and thought about but much more widely than academics it needs to be understood by societies if they are to preserve and process but in a democratic system otherwise it's very French\nOne problem soon we're wrapping up in the program here I'm afraid is that a liberal democracy in the ... which is\nFine as lots of ... up you know there isn't a passion surrounding the use of liberal democracies up right now there is um and I think that's part of the problem the fire comes in the extremes and the damn pens as they go towards the middle ground which has actually viewed as being safe or grand\nThat's grand you stand on ...

intermediate range missile development is arguably the biggest threat for the U.S [noise] but do you think America can or will do anything to try to now negotiate a new treaty that perhaps including

announced their bombing campaign that was back in March of twenty Fifteen\nThey announced it was going to be a short sharp campaign to restore the internationally recognized government of president ... well that's turned out to be anything but true\nBy one estimate there have been airstrikes carried out by the Saudi led coalition in Yemen every Ninety minutes since then on the impact has been absolutely devastating in terms of the loss of civilian life in terms of the damage to infrastructure\nArms of the loss of civilian life in terms of the damage to infrastructure\nBut also I Would say in terms of the grave damage to Saudi Arabia's international reputation\nOn the longer the conflict has gone on the more instances have been identified by the un of civilian targets being has in coalition airstrikes hospitals weddings funerals schools we went to the scene of one of the most tragic counted the notorious\nRecent airstrikes in a place called die young and the province of data and the north which is a who's he stronghold\nAnd that was where forty two school boys were killed on a boss\nWe met some of the survivors we met their parents we went to the school we saw the empty desks we saw the new grave yard full of children's bodies the empty graves that are waiting for the remains of children that still have not been identified two months on\nOn there are many who are asking if this another Saturday airstrikes actually amount to a war crime so it's a deeply damaging inexpensive conflict for Saudi Arabia on his no indication that they have any exit strategy\nThey're all fourteen million people in Yemen facing found them in twenty Eighteen what did you see there\nHad an opportunity over a period of about two weeks to see the scale of the men's suffering in Yemen this was my fifth trip\nBut I hadn't been in Sana'a the capital in two years\nI did was really shocking to see how much things have deteriorated there has been a massive cholera epidemic the largest

suffering famine within a few months if there was no political solution and under certainly isn't one on the horizon\nCool so the aid agencies able to do with the momentum what do they think needs to happen though\nI mean one thing you hear from the aid agencies on from Yemen Egypt Druze and indeed Yemeni civilians the messages is really the same from everyone at the end the conflict what we need is the end to the conflict on the great fear is around the red sea port of data that's in the hands of the who the rebels there has been an offensive since about June\nBy the Saudi led coalition on on the various forces that support the government of Yemen the UN and da da da and seeds are desperately concerned that any attempt that results in fighting in the port would be catastrophic\nBecause her data really is the lifeline about eighty percent of Yemen's age food supplies few medicine it was coming in through her day to\nThe UN is managing to operate their other organizations like save the

technology able to camp to compromise is ready to be deployed on a large scale right now\nSo is this a solution to climate change I asked our environment correspondent across the\nWith these techniques that they talked about here is that nobody's retry them yet because there's no real financial incentive to do them but on the basis of the calculations of these scientists and others have done they are talking about the fact that by the middle of the century we need to be removing about twenty billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year\nAnd that some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told and everybody did have some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer technologies that are coming on there you know we're talking about planting trees and changing farming practices the brothers would be boring things the more ... into things where you've got these machines that looked like washing machines with friends in the ... of the year\nThey can do that right now they cost about six hundred dollars a ton of carbon that they are removed but the report's authors are actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we think about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a time if they do that\nThat's a very successful and we could beat this problem\nThe big problem with that is this what they philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove comments that Mr why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers that politicians and campaigners environmentalists really worry about because\nThe big dangers that politicians and campaigners environmental is really worry about because if people think there's gonna be a solution ten years down the track they'll keep flying they'll keep eating meat to keep driving cars they do all the things that are contributing to the problem right now\nTo the extent is common capture happening all ready and how can you make it more appealing\nYeah other lots of different things going on the moments every country in the world is planting trees pretty much people are trying to change the way that they do far station that the\nLength and the ... the trees grow or they changed you know when they have a massive kilometer you fire or something they plan pretty quickly the bigger more technical industrial challenge of poultry on big pieces of technology to coal fired stations\nThey're all they're in theory but very few in practice is literally a handful around the world and the big problem with that of course all these big bits of case cost lots of money and nobody really wants to put their hands in the park has to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report has come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do blue carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshlands near the sea if you can protect those ... source of our sing for common they soak up more common than anything else\nAnd you can do it for about twenty dollars a ton of carbon and that is really really cheap\nThe bigger problem of course the long term is we don't have enough of them you know the fight the number of coastal areas in the world is finite\nPeople want to build new coastal areas and you've got this thing called sea level rise happening as well which might wipe out some of the gains were making so\nThe big tech not really happening a lot of smaller think is happening and it's cheap and not just reporters things when you do more than two you\nIncentivize countries such as China countries such as India which have been industrialized in very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape that was\nAnd I think very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape that was doing carbon capture\nYeah both China and India are taking all these steps in terms of planting trees and doing other things that also obviously building lots of coal fired plants as well [noise]\nHow this works out no one really knows to be honest with you the hope and belief amongst richer countries is that if they develop better technology to capture carbon and sequester it then there'll be able to either share that technology but Indian China\nNothing really happened so far and there are a number of intellectual property questions about all the big challenges with China and India they remain on salt

I think clearly Diego this strategy of shifting the blame to others is not working any longer to the party\nFirst when the scandal when the cyclical a corruption scheme was discovered that the PTA react to the shift in the blame to the media to the judicial power as if they were parts of the conspiracy against the tea\nThen when a before that Wendy economy started going down they said that they shifted to blame to the external environment so a yearly this is just rhetoric is not working any longer just look up the pros I mean people are not buying the story and they won't let me let me\nTry food then let's talk about how crime and they will talk about how this election is being conducted holiday was affecting how Brazilians think about which way to fight\nHas become endemic in Brazil the read of homicides in Brazil or has reached record levels in the last years and now we have three homeless\nYears and now we have three homicides for one hundred thousand inhabitants what puts Brazil among the most violent countries in the world the nature of crime and Brazil has changed\nThere are strong organized crime linked to drug trafficking in Brazil and who are the sections of the population who are worst hit by this wave of criminality\nPoor people read and it's no wonder this year it is worth noting it is to put people who have areas the ... how we'll have more poor people have tended to vote more PT that say honey into hosted ... if you are right if you look at the north eastern part to Brazil\nWhen you take a huge metropolitan areas such as real\nWhich is emblematic of this endemic crime problem those poor people tend to vote to boso now too as a sort of knee jerk reaction to criminality based on the idea which in my view is wrong\nThat we need extrajudicial killings for instance the G with that problem\nSay Monica who that is one of the policy that food is passing on such and that kind of crime levels that such as just been describing now I think like a lot of people are seeing now is that that wasn't always the case that that you could make this connection but there's a clear connection between corruption\nAnd and the chaos of the public security system in Brazil\nI'm originally from Rio my home state is like the ground zero of corruption in Brazil\nAnd have you had the governor now former governor who is in prison\nAnd if you had the governor now former governor who is in prison and the skill of of corruption in something mind boggling\nDo you just got an a continual policy hoped to reassure voters that it can tackle crime effectively if it is linked to Brazil's\nEconomic suck instances and indeed the levels of corruption\nYes first I think we were talking to an international lawyers so it's very important to explain that security and Brazil is ... by each state's and by the federal government but having said that\nAs the previous commentators or talking and I agree with them organized crime in Brazil was seen through borders between stay there for one of the measures that a\n... is a United security service that we work around the whole of Brazil the other kinds of the gym was so narrow phrases policemen or people that use ... ways to kill\nMonica you don't ever defensible I think that a lot of it has to put him on that right and uh for example one thing that he complains that the ... nobody cares seems to care when police officers are cute and there is a real uh the ... by the police force that they're not being valued\nAnd that they're not being given the resources that they need\nBut that still doesn't justify that's not the same as ... today Joshua leaving home leg is don't really know what do you say what\nHe is sad is that between having a police officer cue than a criminal living in a situation of confrontation we just like how the point is here in the last ... such as to\nBrazilian police cannot be compared with the police in the U.S nor the Brazilian society can be compared with the Americans to say the level of violence and was\nThe American side of the level of violence and Brazil\nHas been extreme Brazil is a brute to countries let's make no mistake about that so I think it's completely an justifiable to praise extrajudicial killings ... has never been\nExplicit about that but the few words with the ... and this is dangerous enough I guess it's like a lessening the dogs out\nUnconscious of the time that Marie don't try to bring you in briefly to talk about if we made the conduct of this election campaign and the role of social media just give us a sense of how it's been used\nI just before talking on the social media I think the levels of violence in Brazil like stream hundred and Seventy five homicides the days over sixty two sixty three thousand last year having said that I Would say there is absolutely never any justification to use extrajudicial killings\nAlso consider widespread gun ownership I'm drawing a carrying around of guns will only escalate the situation not make it come up these sort of simplistic solutions\nAnd using a campaign for coming in to your question using a campaign based on fear fear of what might happen and might even you have HUD has happened to people you know is not the way to go around addressing what type of ... complex social issues\nBrazil is a country absolutely ridden with inequalities absolute ... I'm voiceless mess of parts of the population\nThat hold that thought plenty to think about that thank you very much top on also now so it's a moderate dumped to go to Monica who dominate ... such a faster and dig Scott donate we have to take a short break but just to remind you that is that what you think of the program or anything\nWe have to take a short break but just to remind you let us know what you think the program or any ideas for topics you'd like us to look into the real story at BBC don't care to UK is the email treat me I read that and if you enjoy the program as appalled cost you can subscribe to such will BBC the real story in your podcast up\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

mid century a\nOn the other side you have a dodge who has a kind of a developmental list approach to the economy where this stage ought to have\nA friend [noise] so what we have in Brazil now is is lawless state versus I states that will intervene in the economy to create jobs and to form and the economy more people have in jobs more people would spend money and ... the present and

and\nMaybe ... ... talk has been liberal but I feel the practice when not to be liberal it will be intervention okay because that's the way Brazil has developed let me just Brazil's development history\nLet's hold on to those two quite distinct views of which way the economy may go I wanted to come back to this idea of Brazil's relationship with its ministry 'cause I think that is part and parcel of this agenda that also has talks about traditional family values very tough on crime and so on\nThere is a memory of course of Brazil's minute she dictatorship which is still rule that when the repression that followed that there were hundreds of people would dissipate or killed many more were detained and tool shed\nAn amnesty law was passed in Nineteen Seventy nine which meant that when they public reckoning on trials about what had happened in those twenty also Yeh is an today the majority of Brazil's votes as the hundred and forty seven million of them\nThey didn't live

up out of that 'cause it's a thing that\nThe child was a prison during the Nineteen sixties and seventies where hundreds of women were held because they went against the dictatorship of fighting for democracy prominent women but former president Dilma Rousseff were imprisoned there will also university students\nSociologist historian doctors and they ended up that either because they believed in

tortured at least in the Taliban families knew where they were and they can visit the women\nAs fair as soon as I filled out the whole lot of colds those lovely little follows low more than ... fall\nIt just shocking how the old to cause a miniature dictatorship is being HUD and Brazil which isn't to fight against corruption a tool it's just militaristic took conservative to schools\nWhich is frightening the women who were imprisoned in the town an order of us have seen this before during the dictatorship ... talks about massive cars and eliminating people who don't share his views so it's very frightening people are worried that they'll end up back in prison during the impeachment of ...\nThose are not paid homage to well numbers and torture so people are ... at the possibility of having a dictatorship and Brazil again and then a poll fifty percent of the president population said they thought it was a possibility ...\nSays ignorance about what happened during the dictatorship the fifth\n... says ignorance about what happened during the dictatorship\nFifty a set of silence about what happened then people who survive that period didn't want to talk about it and I think this is how we could have another dictatorship people ignorant and think that during that period there was older progress but there wasn't and I think that people think this because of the silent\nFilm director Susanna lira Monica who does this one specific point I Want to pick up from from what she was on there I was saying that which feeds into Web Brazil is heading in democratic times it is that

something I don't think that anybody who's voting for both a nod who's the stars because of the leadership regarding its record on on human rights\nAs growing up in Brazil I never I until I was a hit I was sixteen Seventeen years old I never thought that I never knew that I was living in a dictatorship right because my family and my father was a a a salesman and he was a he used to say a so they
