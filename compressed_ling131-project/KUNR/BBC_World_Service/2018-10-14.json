added this last half hour of the program we'll be discussing the disappearance of the\nSaudi journalist ... castle gee I'm why there is a discussion to punish Saudi Arabia as President Trump push it possible also hear about the loaded archbishop Oscar Romero he'll be canonized later today on the\nControversy over the\nStatue of my ... my county in Malawi my two guests all rope told nature I highly librarian or for an academic and run a metro professor of history and politics of\nMartin China and runner I could've copy of today's Sunday Times newspaper here with me and he writes about the corruption charges against the Interpol president in China [noise] that's right\nAnd in many will know that he was arrested last week\nAnd many will know that he was arrested last week in Beijing and is now being put up on bribery charges in China but it's part of a much bigger story which is a crackdown by Xi Jinping the Chinese leader\nAnd his Communist Party government on not just corruption but actually political opposition as well so the two things come together\nAnd that enabled by one very interesting phenomenon which is really big in China the growth of alters intelligence and virtual reality so the state is using tech for surveillance in China\nMuch more than any other government in the world you might say it's almost a kind of trial run for us all to surveillance state in which everyone's behavior is going to be monitored they'll have little ID cards and on those not just\nThe financial details or your rent a criminal record but also things that you do in the neighborhood may be recorded so there's a real social change happening in China and this anti corruption stories just one policy that\nIs because I read an extraordinary thing on the news wise yesterday and this was the the the the software that is in in the hands of the Chinese state was going to be used to target the credit rating to live with the credit rating of anyone found smoking in public\nThat's right it's what's called social credit in other words if you do things in a criminal but or in some ways against public morals could be crossing the road at the wrong place almost seriously of course criticizing the government that will be on the record and you might find that for instance you turn up the railway station you want to buy a rail ticket\nAnd you'll ID card says sorry you didn't have enough social credit points to actually do that it's a completely new way of controlling the population and it's going to get bigger and bigger\n'til you mentioned earlier in the program about your research on race based immigration\nAre there in the program about your research on race based immigration in some West African countries how much to do you see about this in the country is concerned\nWell it's race based citizenship causes so the countries Liberia and Sierra Leone which I'm or formerly\nA slave sort of a slave history with those two countries where former I'm ... from the United states and Britain Kamen founded these countries as a form of\nEnabling black people to own the means of production and running their own state of affairs um and so the two countries have race citizenship clauses that basically stay only people of negro descent so effectively black people can be citizens of Liberia and Sierra Leone\nUm and what's fascinating for me about this historically is that you know the Westphalia and system says uh or or sort of use whiteness as a reference for citizenship white and it's a male and it says a reference for citizenship but with these countries are effectively doing and you can debate whether or not it's right or wrong\nIs that there are centering blackness as a reference for citizenship and for me this is an incredibly revolutionary\nBecause it basically states you know this black lives matter movement black lives matter movement is bringing to the fore that black lives matter um and black citizenship batters and it should be the central focus point for having a discussion about us citizenship there is a debate particularly in Liberia about whether or not it's important to aggregate the clause\n\nDentist that he thought people were crying and shouting I go down and looked at him lying there bleeding such confusion no one knew what to do\nIs killers have never been brought to justice protected by uh\nWhat you do is kill us have never been brought to justice protected by an amnesty ... off of eight Nineteen Ninety to peace agreements I spoke to the American journalist Jean ... in South south at all\nIt's mainly an atmosphere of great joy and celebration they're having two major celebrations tonight in different places one being the ... downtown\nWhere he gave those Sunday homily that made him so famous the other is the little chapel on the grounds of a hospital for people with terminal cancer which was the place where he chose to live as archbishop and it's the place where he was murdered while saying mass one night\nThat will be people who've never heard of Oscar Romero who is see why she sat important\nHe was the arch fish appear in ... the capital from Nineteen Seventy seven to Nineteen eighty and these were the years just before the twelve year civil war broke out here and he was he was really be loved\nAnd respected because he spoke out very strongly about the injustices that existed here and at that time the country was under a military dictatorship so that was pretty risky thing to do and in fact it ended up costing does life he was shot to death the day after\nHe gave a Sunday sermon directing themselves specifically to the members of the armed forces and saying to them you do not have to obey and immoral ordered to go out and kill people\nAnd that did not go down well with some of the authorities said who killed him\nWell it was for the most part people from you on the government's thought the military or were recalled these death squads although it's really important to point out\nThat there was a growing leftist movement here to ensure the\nGrew into a a guerilla movement that launched the war and when they did when they committed\nTo a a guerilla movement that launched the war\nAnd when they did when they committed human rights abuses archbishop Romero was very quick to condemn them too so he was even handed if you will you make a mistake and are you do something wrong and you could count\nOn him denouncing you for it in his homily the following Sunday no matter what your political position was\nHis killings of never being brought to justice why not\nWell for a long time after the war ended in Nineteen Ninety two there was an amnesty law and with that the case couldn't go anywhere now the country's Supreme Court as overturned that ends the law and actually\nThis week in Rome the leader of the Catholic Church cardinal rules that child has has said he thinks it's really important that there be a trial because he says the wounds from the war has never healed and the only way for them read to heal\nIs for the country to find out what the truth really was about his assassination and then for justice to be applied\n[noise] that was journalist gene Columbus speaking to me from El Salvador [noise]\nI have a three thousand people have signed a petition opposing a plan that statue of Manhattan a candy in Malawi commercial capital blanche off the ... muscle group claim not only that the Indian independence or I did nothing for the southern African countries they accused him\nOf being a racist Jimmy Kenya teaches media and communications at the University of Malawi and told me why he backed this cool\nHad most in Malawi has no connection to other countries in Africa or India and it's being in the least is that have been a few publications that are questioning his stomach or an effort\nCynthia is been a few publications about questioning his stance on Africa Africa's again about he was one way or the other races\nYou had a lot of people will be quite surprised to hear this but except perspective that said much in recent years what do you see evidence ... being a racist [noise]\nWhen you look at the relations in Malawi has quite a large Indian community and the most of them run businesses and they are business owners and there's always been sort of conflict between\nIndia and business owners and allow in ... as the Indian Malawi doesn't leave ... doesn't really socialize with a list or that wind up in the community so from my perspective if there's a context without argument\nAnd yet there is a significant Indian community in Malawi ... and as you said you have the Indian government building this conference center [noise] he is\nThe point from in the gum and perspective is more or less like how they argued in gun away the gun in government was forced to take it starts to get my to my gun from invest of gun or the argument was that it has been sort of quality a relationship and has been good a diplomatic relations between that country in India the same argument that are being made in\nMalawi and here we're talking about this statute something that is going to stand in the middle or Mao is commercial capital a hundred or something they should have a sign of tolerance if you want to have this statute build a sign up not always moved on ... years\nYou could argue from that perspective but then when it begins within about watch as such stunts was completely different thing by housing starts are basically you're attending the future generations under current generations that here's somebody that I Do my a supply of it'd be\nSo it's not Manhattan I guarantee who would you like to have a statue of\nThis quite a list of Milo young so it's different for me just to name one pill so and but I think that was designed to my lines and the strategy for these shows but\nMalaria is so different for me just you know one person but I think people do do going ... started you for these shows are example with five to George ... who is one of those are the odds of an formula struggling this country is headed British national tea\n... actually happen if the titles ... people are struggling and be brings out maybe pretty much every country like you to something but it wouldn't be a struggle for somebody\nTo recount here from the university law we ah statues are a bunch of things on a I'm broke too absolutely I think what's interesting about this case is it really is it comes out of this outgrowth of a de colonization pan African his movement across the continent where people are looking at colonial structures be they buildings or names of streets\nI'm ... and just recently changes names that you saw teeny to go back to the indigenous name 'em and even the rose must fall movement at the University of Cape Town with black students talked about it ... that make violence um whereas you know racist policies across the university\nNeeded to move this uh the statue of suffer roads with a sinister colonialist um across the southern African region so I think\nIt's it's it's a bigger kind of conversation that's happening across the continent in academic spaces but also at national level rather you are listening to that to what did you make of it\nWell first of all I Hope that uh the the speakers will go into a campaign to have the name of the city a blonde time change 'cause I think that's nothing and ditched his name them but I'd say there's two reasons why respectfully I Would completely disagree with his position\nThe first one is that he said the gum the has nothing to do with Africa in fact a core support for having spent large parts of his life in South Africa\nAcross the whole of Africa in Kenya in South Africa and elsewhere Indian communities would deeply\nElsewhere Indian communities would deeply involved with liberation movements the African National Congress cause very closely involved with the Indian National Congress which for independence to India\nAnd remembering the liberation was cosmopolitan existed across confidence not just within Africa within India is very important and the second even more important reason is to do with non violent resistance that was going to these great contribution to independence movements the idea of mass\nKnown violence in our current terribly violent era I think that's the contribution that's well worth making of course ... we had some reprehensible views when he was younger he moved complete it goes against theirs when he was older\nAnd rejected cost racism and so forth so understanding how ... developed means that they're not saints that human beings who deserve respect and gum the has much to say to Africa as great African leaders like Monday law have to the entire world\nIs interesting isn't it though how one person can be viewed differently in two different places ten seconds each\n[noise] yeah I mean I think you know I I hear the the points that are taken I think the the concerns across the ... are um are valid again coming out of the colonial sort of an African is anti racist movement um but yes you're you're absolutely right that that the power perspective isn't it run a ten seconds from you\nI Would say the statues of ... and ... should be placed all around the world and plenty of other figures too\nAbout the final word run a ... a professor of history and politics of Martin China from Oxford University ... tell me joy highly Liberian academic and offer an author a book on corruption for children as young as I thank you\nA book on corruption for children as young as I thank you both for joining us in the studio here on the weekend program on the b._b._c. World Service plenty more in the hours ahead on this radio station\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

I came in thinking you know I'm a rational amount of science degree I Know that there are these ... known to surface as other real bearing on the real physical world but actually I didn't encounter myself do that either and\nYou know what else to semi sulfate says yesterday did yeah so\nI think like me and I printed a couple of them out how to pitch of\nYour mom and your brother is\nOr\nYou broke up with yeah I just wonder you know just to see [noise]\nComfortable with you I can get one iota succumb to which I think it's similar to wishing it'll somebody you know you're not you're not going to be able to actually change their lives and bring them something about just by thinking about that but\nWould you want to it so easy for me to just not do that I'd rather just to just not\nDo that you don't have to ... and I\nThinking about his days at the very common thing Rachel magic at several emotional thing today and when you do and to not check 'em your least psychologically changing something in your south to the basement during it\nThanks to Sophie page on no thanks to my easily inclined to produce the mouse for that mean trick now I'm going to go out and the limits\nSo for that mean trick now I'm going to go on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on stabbing does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either but it was a bit surprised by how strong my version was\nEven though I knew Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture\nSo what's going on here how can something that we know isn't truth still have an impact on the way we behave and to Jane rises and professor of behavioral science at Chicago universities Booth School of business and an expert in magical thinking\nMy way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo whether these superstitious or a true to kind of beliefs come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nI think that they are building on psychological process sees and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are here for a reason\nSo for example we're always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen\nWe are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not so even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being ... related that ends up\nI see them as actually being causes related\nThat ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense or another example is the way that she respects or sort of the rules of some that are mind will rely on so\nIt's a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program ... there was a bit of amusing about food too and um but producing those very cruelly brought along some pictures of my son loved ones and I was off default words like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it I was just so chasing it with a bad outcome of anything but happening to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different ... which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of The Likeness if you're just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between\nTwo things that look so much alike and that is part of where the voodoo believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work I'm Sorry\nAnd building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work I'm sort of asking the question why do ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how a very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand superstition too which is the idea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates\nVery quickly in automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources\nOr sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition and the slower process can then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air\nAnd what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case\nSometimes that slow system recognizes the air it recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintain that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment\nI Want you to imagine this I have three of loops on the table and one of them you don't know which has the money inside that you can win I Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three\nChosen okay good now you can keep your ... or you can slip it for the remaining to him but look what\nYou guys will usually go for the two [laughter] no question here rationally\nWill usually go for the two [laughter] there is no question here rationally what you should do but a lot of people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find is that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they weren't you trade it\nThen it would become more likely to win a this is where the magic comes and so\nThey're torn between an intuition where they shouldn't trade there on ... and the rational knowledge that they should we find that a large minority of them I said around like forty percent of them will stick with one novel up while\nThat seemed like a really high number and so what you're saying there is that that kind of choice that between the intuition and then the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems\nIn our brain and an sometimes rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given to the first in Jewish and system just because\nJust because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that\nIntuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not the rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it so another thing to consider is the cost of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs I explain my experience with the food too so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi rational person on the radio but the cost of ignoring the intuition that I see this is going to be really positive I ... through a picture of a loved one ...\nI see this is going to be really bad if I ... through a picture of a loved one that's a big cost so I'd rather avoid that and not do it\nYeah I think that's a perfect illustration the only thing that I Would add to that description there is to just say that the reason you're having an emotional reaction in the first place is because there is some sort of superstitious intuition underlying\nI mean not even just to the extent that you're entertaining it as a possibility Jane rise in the\nYou are listening to crowd science on the b._b._c.

[laughter] you're not\n[laughter] [noise] we feel very\nBecause it's not on democratic to say that now that we know what is at stake and now what is that what what lives there were told about the the we have a second run\nBut I Would say would be very clever to to say that you will keep the same rights of course because I mean ostrich should be interested to keep people like you hear in Austria I Would say but\nIts governments turn ever really now\nSeem rides because otherwise the whole systems of ah education\nResearch a unit was it is that's really the main problem because uh the whole exchange or in the hospitals Bruce programs\nThat ... would be ... uh when it will not work it will be really for the whole system of higher education science research and he was with his ...\nWill be cut us off if you say no\nIt is in Austria will be catastrophic if you\nSay no you are oh hell yeah the whole your do you\nBelieve the Austria could under those circumstances given the impact on our strict could say regardless of what the other twenty six EU member states to we will grants to UK citizens here exactly the same terms as they have at the moment\nWhich is implicit in our questioner\nI we discuss this a few days ago and I said uh the European Union children only make this for people from uh the United kingdom but for all people from the commonwealth\nOkay I'm I'm ...\nOn this issue with like people to has been said but this I understand that the national state does some tests and they feed them we are in the union and both the union besides we have to follow\nYou know of course you have to ... you can you're allowed to have your own a certain legal we've we've we can give them citizenship according to all alone yeah fun but one one important question you could say well we're as Australians or us as the republic of all she wants to have\nTo attract maybe citizens from the u._k. afterwards even if there is no agreement though is when I was afraid like right now I don't know for like three minutes but of course you have somebody to a ...\nThis is union law at the beginning that but we are not words we can use our into the legal system with giving citizenship that we'll\nWe'll go we'll go to our\nNext question which comes from ... out here\nWhat is hip position on the recent protests\nAnd now they're thinking what is hip\nPosition on the recent petition and equality for women and what matches the in this industry\nCaught the partition demands equal pay equal representation and possibly this equal representation on public boards reduction of the ... to ... hours a week\nFree contraceptives and pregnancy tests abortions to be available in all public health institutions free and high quality child care until the child is fourteen limiting what do you what do you make of this ... what is your position on this\nIt's necessary and it's ah where are the same or and similar position I guess Fifteen Years ago with the same issue\nBut in many fields he'll still have a situation that they don't have a co pay 'em that uh women get and you'll see it when they get older because they have\nJobs where they didn't get paid a lot of the\nUh working part time and when they are in the um when the pension and the gap between men and women in the income and the pension is getting wider than during the ... the I enter the Academy of fine arts\nWould only when it was you know stir when all categories more than fifty percent women\nAccording to the obesity in Austria on average is is twenty sixteen average women uh pay twenty three percent less ... in this case are strict I was Twenty one out of a sudden the three countries are examined by the CD [noise]\nWhat do you make the opposition do you like it was the main reason why by the government and particularly the minister women's affairs has no\nThe main reason why by the government and particularly the minister women's affairs has not been supportive or has not signed a this initiative is because there are certain aspects in this a proposal\nThat uh she and the government disagrees with while at the same time there many that the government agrees with that one of them clearly is the one that you just mentioned equal pay\nFor equal work and that is anything supported tough\nWell I support Trump and points completely equal pay or go to set up all these equal opportunities on boards\nAnd they'll do little to provide reports because this is an elite these popular because your biscuit to same ladies who seat on the porch you have to go for the town was the ... the amount of water to not to treat you the three of the week\nThe demand is it generally is set up the hour we're up in ...\nAnd do you think you should be going through the whole initiative a lot of people would sign but they don't like this but the general idea that you create if the conscience just in Austria concerning equal rights equal pay equal opportunities I completely agree for liberal party about him idolizing\n... I agree with a sexually um that's why we as a liberal party didn't do do not officially support this initiative I mean there are a lot of people within our party to find it a lot of people who didn't sign it I personally didn't sign it although I think it's very crucial to have it because we are very traditional conservative country\nAnd we have to move forward when it comes to a women's rights when it comes to also like childcare for example I mean we in Vienna we have a wonderful situation but let's go to the countryside that then you have to stay at home like for two years or two and a half years because you don't have any kindergarten edits\nYears of two and a half years because you don't have any kindergarten and it takes her children under the age of like two and a half years so\nSpots I totally agree that this one proposal regarding the the ... says thirty hours a week is really a problem and it's especially a problem for women I think and that's why I personally didn't sign it although I was really like it was an easy\nFor me to design it was it was all done or said while you're going to sign it while you didn't like it in that there is in that there is that the moms for a free contraceptives and pregnancy test snowball shows to be available in all public health since\nI'm ... I'm I I agree with the abortion but I Do not agree with that totally free contraception that mean for some young people yes but you know everything for free I I think it's problematic\nX Y y y no free concerts diminished you shouldn't get things for nothing to\nWell I think I'm a weather for ... for ... young women it is good to have free contraception but I I think it's not necessary to have it for long women but I\nWanted to go to very clear position for politician of your ... your when you think it's going to do it for ... for young women but not for all women\nRan around at that point is is it affordable you have to have the situation where it's not affordable you have to do you want as a politician he wants I totally understand that they want to um stop the problems in those cases where people cannot afford\nIt I'm going to go to our audience on this issue hands up the words of people who want to comment on this petition and its ability its value any women in the audience who'd like to have a word about this just this running back and to see your hand off on the left hand side\nWhat about this yes it's run by that and to see your hand off on the left hand side by three rose from the back\n... on the referendum in a country where the gender pay gap is over twenty percent and we are at the\nEnd of the scale in Europe and it's shameful for any woman not to sign this referendum and for any man not to sign this referendum\nThe thirty hours a week for me is just a detail because coming into a new world of new work and digital ... and it's very likely working hours are going to fall anyway so not very visionary I'm afraid with all due respect any any women here who who\nHave [noise]\nAny any women here\nIs another woman over that who have will have not signed the petition or why\nHigh I'm\nStill trying to find very interesting that you never touched a to point of abortion you're talking about contraception abortion is not even mentions so tired and does lots of talking about that and that you need somebody knowledge of the great find your notes attached and are these petition\nLet me I was just the ... the government's again spokesperson for the government's I should say free abortions\nShould they be available in all public health institutions has this petition demands\nThat is also one of the reasons why I'm the government ministers not find it because it's one of the the proposals that are not only is it is it because of the religious compulsion to look costs what is is it's a little bit along the line of uh what about to say um there's\nAlong the line of uh what about to say I'm there's certain people to label to afford it and others not so to find the balance between those\nWho come here and why don't you know points from the floor on on\nOn this issue if there's any they men who have the\nCourage of that conviction to have a view express publicly yes found that in the back", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Reno", "day": "14"}
