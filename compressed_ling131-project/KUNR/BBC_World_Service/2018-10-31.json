or eleven worshipers were killed in what it was believed to have been the worst anti Semitism ethic attack and recent us history security was stepped up ahead of his visit amid accusations Mr Trump's rhetoric\nHad encouraged anti Semitic extremists\nEarlier grieving parents gathered at the tree of life synagogue for the first funeral the victims of the mass shooting\nNot an understatement to say President Trump's visit to Pittsburgh has been divisive Julian roast the political reporter for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette explained to me earlier\nFirst started whenever the president had said that in his Fox News interview that um he was going to come here I think was the first time he said it and as soon as he had said that the mayor of Pittsburgh\nHe was going to come here I think was the first time he said it and as soon as he had said that the mayor of Pittsburgh came out and said\nHey Mr Trump ... you know we want you to come but at the same time we want to bury our dead first so I think that really kicked off you know a line of um you know declined invitations here you had President Trump greeted by no public officials here today in Pittsburgh\nThe governor didn't show up on the Allegheny county executive rich Fitzgerald declined\nHim and they all either you know said that it was a scheduling matter or because leaders need to respect the families and the community's wishes I think that's sort of built the public sentiment there were a lot of protesters along the motorcade today on but there are also a lot of Trump supporters who showed up along the route to\nUm you know express their love of the president with signs and with make America great again hats\nSo so even the local population they were divided about ... about the visit tell me more about these protests\nWell there were some protests of course I didn't get to be in the middle of the protests are actually from the motorcade route you couldn't really tell honestly the protests were even going on and they chose a very interesting a route to travel to the city but shortly before Mr Trump arrived at a synagogue\nOr there was a crowd that gathered at a very close by to tree of life um traffic slowed down police were arguing with some of the marchers in the marchers were um you know yelling things like I don't want to be here for Trump were burying our friends\nUm they were holding signs they were uh you know chanting the only thing that can be heard by the president today I'm at all was it was a small chance about a block away from when he was\nLaying the stone and white roses under the memorial people were chanting make America peaceful again\nAnd and what about the president himself what what what did he do on the visit did he need any of the family members\nHe did so he started the tree of life on the scene of the massacre that happened this weekend he went inside the vegetable of the synagogue a with rabbi\nRiver plate toward the visitors to Brazil's Crimea and they

all of it's beginning to have an effect here is Connie ... who is the editor in chief of seeing the news that challenges that [laughter]\nNews that challenges that Facebook has had has to do with credibility and trust and the platform they've had\nChallenges over the past several months when it comes to user data Cambridge Analytica which happened in March was a misstep in terms of their business practices that allowed data that eighty seven million users to get out there in the wild ride\nThat was the way that Facebook managed to its business it's been coping with fake news and misinformation being spread on its platform it's been looking at that actors\nIn the case of Russia and Iran taking advantage and you know co opting its platform to spread and so this content so the question is about is Facebook a platform that we can trust\nWith our most private information and continue to engage on and so those are the things that are overshadowing whether or not you think it's a great platform\nJust yesterday the New York times did a piece about how many hate messages are on Instagram which is one of the biggest brightest areas of growth\nFor Facebook and that's troubling so people are looking at the platform and wondering you know how long is it going to take them to fix it and clean it up and do I need to engage is actively as I have in the past while that clean up

cease for ages ago\n[noise] yes uh I I think that's right um I think from our perspective there's a lot of that could have been done 'em before a call for the ceasefire but the ceasefire is a significant breakthrough in this war and a welcome recognition that the current policy is failing and\nIt's a recognition that there is no military solution to the end of the war in Yemen there's only a diplomatic solution and\nUrging people to get around the table and negotiate for peace is what absolutely needs to happen and a ceasefire absolutely needs to happen so that humanitarian aid can be

L. court foundation\nIn memory of E. L. accord pioneer radio broadcaster\nBut you know they don't appreciate that some degree the character of these societies are already changing regardless of what happens these have you migration so I think that there's a lot of confusion in the debate because of that I don't want you on this issue than my answer is pretty straightforward my answer is that\nIf you're thinking about the coming decades we're going to face major challenges of off shoring automation and much else\nWe do need to have somewhat more integration somewhat more cohesion\nIn our market democracies which otherwise risk coming apart at the themes in class terms and many other terms besides and because of that with that in mind we ought to adopt a more integration friendly migration policy one thought is that you're not necessarily going to radically increase\nThe number of a new migrants when you will do is perhaps move towards selecting them on the basis of skills selecting them on the basis of a who will be in a position to help finance the safety net for\nThe various migrants we've absorbed over the last thirty or forty years because that to my mind is the really big challenge\n... over the last thirty or forty years because that to my mind is the really big challenge it's the second generation challenge how do we ensure that the second generation the children of working class immigrants are properly integrated into our society and are allowed to flourish\nIt kind of changes the whole nature of what America is about though is well doesn't it I mean the America's always been about people coming to see the American dream being always be in the country what people just go to realize what they call it ...\nWell ... I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context\nIf you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds that was a time of the birth rate in the states with about seven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today\nAnd that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely important part of population change in the United states and that era\nIf you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skill workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy\nThen the situation is quite different and it creates new class stratification\nThat entail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks who come from very low income very deprived backgrounds so I think that when you think about the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving interests\nAnd it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\n... son on editor of the national review conservative magazine in the U. S.\nCurbing immigration as he suggests would spell the end of a classic American narrative that is at the Pentagon is immigrant who arrives to seek a new life and through hard work determination goes on to prosper and thrive\nSo would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration after all the United states is often described as homes the largest immigrant population in the world [noise]\nIt's a question I put to the Trump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nIf you look at the history of immigration and how immigrants have been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war prior to the civil war citizenship was restricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship\nAnd in the grants were welcome to that is white people were welcome to there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship\nThere was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did the manual labor the agricultural labor but they were not eligible for citizenship\nAnd they were not considered immigrants so when we say this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narrative and it's connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens and people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship\nNow after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship citizenship by birth is created\nAnd this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have ...\nAbsolutely racialized the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people defined as racially ineligible to citizenship and they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth\nThat would imply that the American dream is a myth\nIt's a very racialized myth that is it's been a dream for white immigrants it's a stream that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about\nThe idea of the American dream in the midst of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the nineteenth and twenty a centuries has applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen to the early twentieth century of large European immigration where this suppose it American Dream was created\nThis was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa now people of color have also accepted this mythology that is the idea that the United states has a country of opportunity\nThe American dream but if you look at how the economy functions today it is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color\nThe immigrants who were coming into the country today it's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority of immigrants do not fall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor\nLow educational levels and they are filling a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them\nBut there is not upward mobility for them\nI have a ... a period in American immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or Africa and or\nCan immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or African or a Latin American immigrant with the same as those for a European\nNo there have even more recent on that doesn't mean that there has never been Asian or Latin American or African immigrants who have succeeded in gaining upward mobility and I'm becoming very successful in the United states but if you look at it historically those populations have been permanently marginal\nClear that you're on a different and the political spectrum to\n... the editor of the national review who had from the other what do you make of his argument\nThat in order to safeguard democracy in America at the moment to allow the current population to adapt to change your calling me what's needed is a cook on immigration because what is happening is that the economy in America is\nChanging to one that's founded on knowledge on stem subjects rather than a Monday factory\nWell that Dan knowledge economy requires a huge service economy to service it who is cleaning the house is taking care of the children making the food growing the food for the wealthy people in the service economy it's poor people of color who are providing those services\nProfessor of either Chomsky at Salem State University and in case you're wondering yes she is the daughter of

L. accord pioneer radio broadcaster\nA slight tendency to just think this is a is a new problem but what we want to do with say actually some elements of this problem has deep roots and then there are some things that have been changed by the presence of social media and the ways in which the major environment has changed the last few years\nIt's like for instance in the case of the Bataclan ... people in the venue that night who are sending out at social media empires things people in the area but what does that say Jim ... what what did you learn from looking at that kind of studying\nOne of the really interesting things about the bus Oakland case study but we've seen similar patterns and others as well as you do have\nIndividuals in the same ... to their followers that they are in that and that is we're sort of horrific things Gail that's quite important because from from a place in Port of you will the police it never quite sure of\nIs this a genuine message or is this someone one of the terrorists inside the venue who has to ... to ... to ... and his deliberately trying to do them for confrontation so you've got to get these very\nVery dynamic situations that increase the pressure of place decision by cars so they could have to decide what are they going to do with all of this was the information that is coming out in in these kinds of seeds and the Bataclan a case was a particular example of that\nAnd in other cases we see examples of why people are really you're earning for real time information if people buy in the community and the\nJoining for real time information if people buy in the community and the emergency responders for instance the Boston Marathon in twenty Seventeen that's an interesting case of a mess that we're being protected by the terrorists but also I buy records happen the terrorist attack so\n... you see is you see all these different act is kind of coming in to play now and there's a lot of population political\nInterests of the current time around misinformation disinformation\nAmong other things we would try to do is try and say well actually in in the minutes of terror attack and in the house and sometimes the days\nIt's really hard to know precisely why is guys all because yes you do have genuine contributes to social media who tried to provide public undecided will happen but you said the people who have tried to agitate the situation trying to mislead and deceitful\nSay what are you having you know France responded emergency services and indeed meter overnight sanctions\nWhile I think one of the things that strikes me about having looked across a large number of terror events is\nThere is enormous pressure these situations to get information out there to kind of be the person to break the story to kind of get that kind of skill\nBut actually it's similar when people get it wrong and this does happen quite regularly that people get it wrote that has quite long the tub detrimental effects in terms of trusted institutions and trust in in democracy and those kinds of things and these things can be exploited\nSo we're kind of saying there are risks to go out to a lady and there are things that you can do to try and manage those risks so for example rather than just reacting to an event have applied have it ... who are you guys talked to who's got his told things when can you say things\nBecause of it it's just trying to avoid the information vacuum that they often is just filled by load of ... and maybe some home\nInformation vacuum that so often is just filled by load of ... and maybe some harmful militias messages as well designed to cause disruption\nThat ... I think one of the key findings rallies by by looking back over an extended period of time we're able to to track how place in governmental responses have changed at all to the ... to to to the new nation of our but and I'm One of the things that's quite clear is\nIf they say nothing if they do leave that vacuum that other people will come in to make mischief so it's really important\nFor all the place of government and politicians to be able unclear to say in these kind of moments of emergency crisis what people are very ... you know this is what we can tell you said that you don't leave a cat so others can come into the affiliate misinformation and disinformation\nPops mountain in ... and bill Thompson you've read that report what did you\nMake of it um I think it's really important what especially because it's it's well ours has to be allowed to use any trees you know it's one of the things this is just sensible\nIt is clear that this will help because what it tells you is allows organizations that are responsible in some way for the information flow around these terrible events to thing can advance about how they might respond\nTo have a strategy in place which we can then follow that makes it much less likely that they will just do something to magically make a mistake because you follow most likely to get you roll if you go on your instincts at a time like this\nAnd I think it also has also advice for all of us I mean obviously if all sides of journalists who are taking his information coming out but also anyone who's got access to Facebook Twitter or any other social media which is\nThink carefully about the messages that your amplifying as well you know they're just automatically retreat somebody who's it sounds like your friends will want to know unless you can so that you'll say I'll be very careful we actually\nUnless you can socio sales be very careful we actually have a responsibility to take care with information environment around that some of the report does it just gives a really good for you but\nThank you very much bill he is bill Thompson I'm Karen Michel ... how to make fizzy I fun with the aid if some small fines video games and how to balance poodle ... if you prefer that they were always if you don't know what one of these reports that Simon Moulton describes the in this report from New Zealand\nIf you've been unlucky and picked up an injury walls playing sports or exercising then you might have ended up seeing a physio therapists catch for ...\nExercises today as part of the re head and Danny today highland independently engage with ice and that would they have that guess challenges that patients who come back in LA that and that they haven't done the exercises\nOr what they will give excuses why they haven't done then or now said to have done them when they haven't done\nAnd it's pretty easy to tell that they lie that left on their exercises because of a you get them to perform at and I've got no idea what they're doing\nPhysio therapists Tim Dolan has been traveling video games as a way to encourage his patients to do the exercises home speed on recovering [noise]\n\nOn your smartphone measures the movements you make on a balance\nPort Benjamin done as part of the team that came up with the idea of tuning a balance board and the smartphone into a videogame\nDown towards the disc roughly forty to fifty centimeters wide with a semi circular base underneath which means when you stand on it it's unstable so you have to try and balance\nUnderneath which means when you stand on it it's unstable so you have to try and balance to stay stable so the center on the gyroscope in the phone that you already have are perfectly capable of measuring these movements and basically it's measuring the angle on the balance board and thereby your center balance\nSo you go till then measured the movements you make on that balance board and transfer them to the computer which runs the games which turns those movements into something that is fun and ...
