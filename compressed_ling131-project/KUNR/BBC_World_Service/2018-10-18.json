up any person can sort of\nBlow the whistle but they don't end well stops people from doing that\nBut I think people are sort of fear the backlash that might happen if someone's trying to rock the

read I pushes it into a class that is an extinction class of that it doesn't mean that this impact caused an extinction but it's one of the big ones that's rare in earth history\nSo essentially a meteorite crushed to death and that is what you have a a beat up just Amish\nYeah here the uncertainty behind this and why it hasn't been discovered clearly before is this is an impact structure that's buried it happened about three hundred and sixty million years ago when sharks were roaming the seas and plants just started to colonize land\nAnd so during that time this large event occurred it would have generated towering tsunamis and other catastrophes over time it got buried and when we want to study at today we need other means to study it so our discovery was made by drill core collected nearly Twenty years ago\nWhile so it's a historical discovery in a sense\nWell think about this if the impact that hit Mexico sixty five million years ago it didn't occur the dinosaurs would still be roaming the earth mammals may not have ... we wouldn't be having this conversation assuredly and so we know the big impacts in cause dramatic changes\nOr to a to a or a than the things living on it\nThat impact is a hundred and eighty eighty kilometers in diameter and the one in Western Australia called would lay we think it's probably much greater than a hundred kilometers in diameter so it's the big one that killed the dinosaurs isn't even twice that size it's a big event\nFascinating soft of our income mostly thank you very much for talking to a nice day\nOut and about Ninety

listeners have heard of ... tell us about her story and why it was so remarkable\nWell thanks for having me I knew or as a personal inspiration to me because like\nI put into you know Indian impacts on the origin I'm an immigrant I came here in the u._k. when I was five\nAnd a growing up I I heard about this woman story and it just became more residents to me and it struck me that very few people knew about whether they were all ethnic minority origin or or Asian or Indian or whether they were purchased a meaning a white person so in terms of a story she was a Muslim syfy pacifist\nShe was born to an Indian father an American mother and she was actually\nShe was a Muslim ... she was born in India and father an American mother\nAnd she was actually a children's writer in Paris then when World War two broke out a family moved to the u._k. and she volunteered for the women's auxiliary apples um two years later she was picked up by the special operations executive which was a special unit created by Winston Churchill\nAnd she was the first female rage to operate a to B infiltrated into any enemy occupied France aged just twenty nine years old so essentially she was part of an intelligence unit yes yeah I don't age twenty nine\n... and one of the leading ones because what happened was that could stop those doctor to round up um their spy network and she was she was she she was adjusted to come back to the u._k. but she did not want to abandon a French colleagues without communication so she stayed\nAnd she singlehandedly this Indian woman a pacifist\nThe Muslim sixty she ran a cell of agents by herself saving countless of lives and the sad thing is she was captured by the Nazis she was tortured and famously never gave up any information and then she and others

somewhat\nAnd is this why you decided to start this campaign to honor to honor her story but also to bring it to the spotlight\nYes absolutely I mean the thing is when you look at these campaigns and and you ... your your um your listeners might know that as one campaign to to have Margaret Thatcher the former prime minister on it\nYou'll um your listeners might know as one campaign to to have

all these women of of this special operations for the forgotten figure is basically or they figure is\nA well well to quote the movie absolutely you know why don't we know about it and and and with

you might happens are\nYou know what I'm quite positive but the only thing you can do is keep going I'm just too but I I I had a big big spots of of of inspiration earlier on because\nThe um the

universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call in was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in class and what we're seeing on the news\nWith a mismatch between what they were learning and close what we're seeing on the news it was supposed banks and then the whole financial system began crushing though\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning this in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics tosses a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions at the crisis\nAnd Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well\nYour studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which has seemed to weigh a financial crisis was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession has become windy calling is the most widely used university textbooks\nIn retrospect she admits these books must stumped subjects that we hugely important in terms of understanding the crush\nThings as basic as how finance works\nCan put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy so the the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system and this was very typical\nOn banks all the financial system at least it was very typical of the way that curriculum excess taught in universities around the world\nAnd has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think this is true or not just the opposite of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate\nAnd going to steal the financial systems in which we all depend if they get bad advice you can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration felt by students and their teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others are building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionate about\nAnd so I have to put my own hand up here I chair the core charity\nBut will it different curriculum be enough\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper calls the tune bankers and politicians founded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's morals allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\nAnd that's a much easier economics professor at Stanford University in the U.S\nShe's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what people want to hear well turning a blind eye to bind even criminal behavior by buying cars that can threaten financial stability\nIs definitely a problem it is very very shocking they remain really fantastic cut in the sense of how they explored the system\nSkiing there remain really fantastic cut in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end ignoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flooding incentives and all the deception and fraud and all the excessive endangerment\nThat's an entirely unnecessary it's just taken is given it's just what they accept the system until she thinks is changed following the crisis\nWhat you hear is the more and out you know very shockingly you know stuff happens then you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big groups at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it and then he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before\nLet's fix it but then the fix is really not quiet ride but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can be prevented stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz comes down to the continued reliance record numbers on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind believed that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true I think it'd be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized\nIdeas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together they conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith that conservatives I'd miss used his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will hand often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand than supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys and sells things in their self interest and threads freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by then to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple it's just that somebody knows something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes and in Dr needed their students\nThe markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines\nWhy do the corner must expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem at the heart of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were a science ... only works if you mentioned old humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to the economy can be counted\nJournalist Katrin muscles book who cooked on a smooth spinner argues the traditional economic theories and methods only makes sense if you mentioned humanity be self centered so unlike humans as almost a different species in fact some economists have given the species Elaine ... economic is\nHome economics ... doesn't have any feelings at least those feelings that not relevant to his economic decision making he's this sort of rational calculating brain that is always acting additive self interest and all of the set of characteristics or characteristics that we have been told to view as a male\nAnd even more obvious is sort of all the characteristics that economics guys to great lengths trying to exclude from these models like emotions family the faulty feelings compassion altruism\nAnd all of these things that we have been told that these are not economically relevant these not anything that we need to studying economics like send you the same things that we have been torched view as female\nI Know but the off to the Chrysler people were saying\nThis greed is good philosophy and this very narrow idea of what human beings are it's not good we need to bring these other values back in\nCan't solve our economic problems without the courage to the U.S helps with all that makes us human\nHe is the U.S held with all that makes that human and failed economic models and economic theory that is actually based on that\nI agree with Katrin but assuming that people are simply rational neglect key mentions of what makes us human that this was an important reason white Columbus fail to see the crisis coming\nThey do not understand the hubris collusion and trading testosterone that makes bankers appear to be on steroids even when they knocked\nRocketry and his rights to highlight the bread the factors that influence decisions she's expecting too much of economics or indeed any discipline to incorporate all aspects of human behavior\nThe growing depth and breadth of knowledge requires most specialization but to understand how to tackle road we'll problems more into this marriage is required\nThe financial crisis happened in my view not because the tools didn't exist in economics to understand what was

to this question of what he says well established principles that\nYour private correspondence can be private even if it's in a workplace context and ended up to this issue about whether the\nFat balance had been achieved and\nOne of the key things about that case is an individual hadn't clearly had advance warning that the employer can monitor his communications or could read the contents of
