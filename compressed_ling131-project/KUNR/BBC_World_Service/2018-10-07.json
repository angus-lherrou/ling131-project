are you are you sure 'cause I Know people are waiting for you are like well let's see and then he was to sold out concerts was a big surprise and a beautiful moment\nI mean the original ... is not to to sound surprised that it comes to buy you should be sold out but it's sort of haunted incorrect ... I Know we sold out of the Bible\nI Know I Know but you know what they have nothing right now like it's very difficult for artists to go there and tour 'cause it's not worth it like in the economy excite economy side but also people are afraid to go out during the night you know to concerts and so they try to make countries like early during the day\nSo they don't have to be exposed to like you know at eleven PM leaving the theater so\nYou know at eleven PM leaving the theater so yeah for me was also surprised that it was sold out even though was using the night but yeah they're they're they're just like a craving for talent and for people to go on to sing for them\nAnd when you are an all just from a country that has highlighted the moment full so little the wrong reasons mhm do you feel that sense of pressure to perform to writes about it to sing about who took to put some sort of message out there about the situation back home\nOf color pressure at all I think it's something that we actually comes naturally\nThat we want to talk about it that uh as I said because my family's there I'm not I'm really far from the ... can I say that's yeah from the situation because I talked to him every day and they're living at you know so I think it's something that has happened naturally for us to talk about it or to express how we feel and it's more about missing\nMy family missing the beautiful beaches we have they're missing the fact that like if I Want to bring people to go on and see where I'm from they they don't want to go because we're what they see the news and uh\nIt's not too pretty [laughter]\nUm so but yeah I I'm hopeful you know like I think things are going to get better because they have to and people are very very brave and when I went last time people are still working you know he was young people young people with a smile on their face\nJust very happy to be there and working for a better better Venezuela and that was very touching for me\nAnd then the good times will join mogul redraw to look\nFor you really have to visit it's now because I'm from their release [laughter]\nThey said it's not because I'm from their release you all go to is that yeah no I agree it's beautiful I think it's perfect the whether we have actually it's maybe Ninety degrees the whole year [noise]\nI Know it may sound bad for you but he's actually very uh it's amazing because we have the wind or the food each grade people are happy all the time Everytime I showed pictures to people there like what the hell are you doing\nHere [laughter] type me demography drawn and another is playing in London for the first time of the E F G London jazz festival the twenty fifth of them but just some photo brief words from you both but it's an interesting insight into into somebody performing abroad because she has to be a broad bottled oxygen reflections on the family she's missing what's going on back home\nYou don't ... the one thing they're called Marta attention when you're talking to her when you started to touch on the delicate political situation it was the coded language yeah I remember that from the years with the military dictatorship in Brazil\nWas a coded language there are things that you wanted a pastor but you couldn't actually say yeah because you were a fresh you worried about what would happen to family exactly yeah she's got family there so she was ... yeah\nYeah I I think it's interesting that she said people to start for culture is of course that might cut I got used to be ... and mainly allies Sandy I mean I actually have a friend living there and um I Can't understand that the concert was sold out so I agree\nThat both of them and said well listen we're going to have a bit more of a music [noise] going to say thank you to both of you for joining us this morning\n[noise] I was going to say thank you to both of you for joining me this morning let's hang\nOn to get I\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] distribution of the b._b._c.

her\n[noise]\n[laughter] I actually had made a just a joke death metal song but it's about Christmas [noise]\nAnd she loves it she said I Love it plays again [noise]\nAnd she describes the style of

like that's about all the you know the fingers growl\nBut she couldn't do that so I tried to have her things will be more traditional heavy metal and she thinks fine in June but she was just not really comfortable and so she's basically doing a wrap metal kind of thing so she raps over the lyrics\nSay okay what are your thoughts when Petraeus that he he kind of want to wrap this on what did you think\nThought they'd get better with that and that made it a little bit climate fate because he wanted to do it on ... oh\nThat made the little bit ... because he wanted to do it one more oh

university book um\nWe were interested in seeing how far\nWe could go in using the difference between an audio protection and machine on your perception because humans of course how some limits\nTheir perceptual ability for example after a very loud sound human won't be able to perceive a very quiet town that free speech recognition system it's just the same and there's other effects like that so not only can you not your client salads after an hour south\nBut also when you have a very loud sound wanted one frequency for example let's say you at the very very out\nFifty for ... and you won't be able to hear very quiet sounds like at fifty five for its really told spied too that loud sound and also so called cycle acoustic masking effect\nAre utilized already by many gadgets intact so for example you were MP three player also uses those cycles across the effects\nTo be able to work with very compressed audio files in MP three including you only in cold that information that is where I live and that just perceptive the choice Schumann listener and you can throw away you can discard parts of the sound that won't be\nThrow away you can discard parts of the sound that won't be perceived or maybe not in ... them so precisely\nSo there's a lot of checked out there that's using the old um cycle ... masking effect but we were wondering if it would also be possible to use them to hide information from humans which would then be very clearly proceed with the for an automatic system\nRight so it seems from your research that there are ways of am betting and doing so imperceptibly audio signals I Will malicious ... within very sounds and they might be able to trick or something like what about your voice systems or elect so have you\nYou have another example which involves an autonomous cars that you'd like join let's vehicles what does that well\nThe idea is really that if we had\nThat were controlled by voice that we can use that very same attack factor to make it for example in in our example activate the emergency brakes by voice\nSo that you while you're being driven by you know told them it Scott Simon and Garfunkel on the radio\nI mean\nI mean that music sounded normal to me but now we're going to have that same bit of music but you modified it in your research in in\nMiami\nWhich to me frankly it sounds like the ... we played in the first place but in the second clip of the Simon and Garfunkel this is by even bet it's some kind of come out and that will trigger the call to do something then\nIt's actually so we invented a combined ... emergency brakes and ... all the war and of course that's the need for the ... very\nAll the war and of course that's neat pretty trained to be to a very scary scenario where\nYou could imagine a few years in the future\nPeople being actively of put at risk by their says driving ... if those gaps in security aren't really so\nYeah so you mean by the ... on the phone from Isaac speech recognition yeah yeah I'm Sorry but how you doing the same way as if you'd actually set out loud to put the exams in her blog ...\nObviously this is proof of principle and bumping but you point to an end you'll probably be you haven't actually done this or you were the ad as it was just going straight to the voice recognition system so that made me very much prefer principle\nThat's all I'm ... and that our

trained ourselves that's a ... foot the speech recognizer that is very widely used and the research community and we're pretty sure that it's also used in many commercials\nThat we definitely need to

this research\nWhat I really think that's currently the point in time we're companies offering speech recognition systems should look at how to make their neural against us and\nYeah that's an understatement I think there are attacked costs I we need some ... here in our security system and it's really hard\nTo make it because there is is that there is a whole overseas in an all fooled as

production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you\nReally warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures then you're likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall as it raised with ... wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where\nAnd without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great to likely heard of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strengths of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of at the vent to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause has Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you can pin down the Pacific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nWe basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of past research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so there's warmer area than cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initialized\nScale signal from our forecast initial education so that when we run the modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point a degree Celsius\nAs well as changes that that had on the atmosphere temperature as well as an affair temperature changes that have a choice during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific package ... that's ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a change in the U.S that the we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and for that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in the set up\nThese conscience of geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent the interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees\nThat are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming that region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier were seen storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic look potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many of the events that have mocked the past few months\nSea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most summers and recovering more poorly each winter Julian Streever of the national snow and ice data center was recently in the Arctic between Alaska and Siberia seeing herself the continuing decline in Arctic ice\nOf the things when I was just out in the Arctic Ocean in the ... see we\nReally struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up an ice can't and also thick enough to support many people out there doing their their field observations\nAnd also we were trying to deploy ... and you know we couldn't find many floods that were very thick so we're putting out these beliefs and ice that may be a meter thick and you're hoping that it was still survive and locations where we put some of our buoys out already went through that twenty centimeters of note since we had deployed\nThrough about twenty centimeters of melt since we had deployed them which gets worrying because of the ice gets too thin and the booze melt out then we lose our data\nInstruments poll numbers so she's directly related to the climate slash whether shoes off this program\nThe reason why we're so interested in the Arctic is that the Arctic is sort of a refrigerator of our planet right so it helps to keep our planet cooler than it otherwise would be and it does is by the fact that it's covered mostly by snow and ice year round\nIt's ten o'clock GMT an Jackie Lenin and this is the

broke your like\nIf he gives you the explanation but then walks away and doesn't set the bone that's not helpful what we need is not just an explanation of why did this happen we need the doctor to
