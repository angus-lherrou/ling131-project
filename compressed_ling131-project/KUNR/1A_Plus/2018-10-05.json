Gore and the recount in Florida and the Supreme Court deciding the results of an election\nUm that's where your book begins and also where it ends why was that such a pivotal moment for political ideology America yeah no I mean I I think it's the two thousand election to me which is you as close to a perfect tired I think we're ever going to see in a presidential election um\nIt was the perfect combination of the nineties all of the political wars of the Nineteen nineties Bill Clinton\nNewt Gingrich Hillary care Ross Perot pitchforks Pat Buchanan impeachment all of these these major battles these major forces that shape politics created this division that when you looked at that map on election night two thousand and you saw the entire south\nWas now painted red red for Republicans the entire northeast\nMinus New Hampshire barely a was painted blue for Democrats the Pacific coast you could see these\nThe stark geographic boundaries and they were more than geographic they were they were cultural boundaries they were demographic boundaries and I think the nineties really to me it's the decades those colors sync up with the parties those colors took on a partisan

book the red and the blue the Nineteen nineties and the birth of political tribalism well here is one well remembered moment from the nineties I take you back to president almost president at this point Bill Clinton\nYou answer that question is our number ... ... when I was in England I experimented with ... didn't like that in ... in there and again\n[laughter] Bill Clinton in the run up to the presidential elections in Nineteen Ninety two or the deceased late Christopher Hitchens went to Oxford with Bill Clinton said the idea that Bill Clinton didn't inhale at Oxford was probably true because he knew firsthand did Bill Clinton chose to take his marijuana in edible foreign\n... Hitchens used to say he was no friend of Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that\nWe heard from Susan who sent us an email I Believe that our political risk started well before the Nineteen nineties the Vietnam Conflict was one of the most visited issues since the civil war and we still have never recovered and not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the judgment of so you are dead\nMen walking as far as [noise] back in twenty\nTwelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quip Timmy and any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as a Republican Party in the future meeting Republicans had to broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics flash\nForward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore stunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hocus vacation in the Trump here it said to you about where we were in\nIn in where we are yeah I mean I think it tells me that the divide is deepening and you know it did tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand election they say that we've lived with a sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally looked at the Mitt Romney's last to Brock Obama included what Lindsey Graham did demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just the one the general election and that's a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party is like the primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen told Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there\nOf going head to head against Trump of dismissing him completely at the beach\nGraham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things um in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with their voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand granted anymore than granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of his party so what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I\nHave to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator for one more term or is he is he converted what's he thank you I mean look there's then there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but I'll give you a couple of them that that that that jumped out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk if you are seen as separating yourself from this president your neck primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being a being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that\nThere is also the theory that hey part of this is Lindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you're if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises uh if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him\nMaybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons is to is it is again Lindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election and I know it was narrow but seeing the one\nRoad and then seeing down from when the election and I know it was narrow but seeing the one I think tells Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacture them fast enough to be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's changed his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard\nAnd because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and and Steve you're nodding because that does not sound surprising\nTo you ... what he's what he's describing his ticket splitting yet to be and political science they did the voters who go and they a Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and then that that is just the rise of polarization of tribalism All right let's get\nIn our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve ... so much of what your book is about uh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are I'm led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have a when he was a young rabble rousing congressman\nWho was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the Ford

but the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and gory there is this fair Mr President\nAnd the faces that you don't see in the places that you don't visit and you're a shining city\nAnd believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from ... the early nineties I take you back towards any\n\nTo to be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety two on the Arsenio Hall show remember him were Arsenio Hall before that year presidential candidates didn't really appear on night time talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve\nThat was a moment not just because the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nWas also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second but in third place in the presidential race at that point versus Ross Perot [laughter] taking place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried I was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two\nHad was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam drafted going through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of slick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li ... scheme is way out of\nOut of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to did change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around interviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show\nFlowers in the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hot at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality and it was Ninety two it wasn't just starts anew Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot\nWho was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began in February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Larry King and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on and February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show\n'em in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the arson you also that night well we won't be doing anything like that\nAnd Arsenio Hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that went went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign to Bush wasn't doing our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting\nCampaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm politicians now managed media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama had\nA winning personality an affable nice guy and used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon to Stephen cold there there isn't a show the Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than than maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public have\nChanged just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or sending our home\nAnd I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier in the rise of Gingrich net moment with a Neal what that moment came from was Gingrich looking for a way around what at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he use CSPAN\nGive CSPAN was five years old and the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich was able to build his career or his rise in the house around that\nFast forward to Donald Trump what Donald Trump to television obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter Donald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media is well this is so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across the\nThat's that's so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties was CSPAN and Trump was doing with Twitter and and I think there's a real common thread there well let's go back then in the way way back machine one more time\nTo Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential runs long before he was ever successful he went on meet the press back in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about\nPat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party\nIf I can see the al ... re streaming online and K.

A. M. U. dot org worth noting that the president is awake and tweeting today his latest tweet about the Kavanaugh process and the protest against it reads quote\nThe very rude elevator screamer are paid professionals only looking to make senators look bad don't fall for it also look at all of the professional\nFor it also look at all of the professionally made identical signs paid for by Soros and others these are not signs made in the basement from love hash\nTag troublemakers the president's been pretty vocal about this whole process in the last few days has been for some time but it's been turning increasingly negative is a week's going on on Tuesday the president held a rally in Minnesota and took the opportunity to mock Kavanaugh's accuser professor Christine Blasey Ford and question her account of events\nVery six years ago this shop and\nI had one beer [noise] right I add one via\nWell do you think it was you know it was one of them are good how did he get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't\nKnow [noise] I don't know [noise] I don't know [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know where's the house side of [noise] upstairs downstairs where was I don't know but I had one beer that's the only thing I remember [noise]\n\nAnd a man's life is in tatters a man's life is shattered his wife is shattered his daughters who are beautiful incredible\nYoung kids they destroy\nPeople they want to destroy people these are really evil people\nPart of what President Trump said to supporters at a rally in Minnesota on Tuesday Steve Clemons we should note first of all what the president said he's on true professor for did not say that the only thing she remembered was having one beer ironically she said the things she most remembered was\nIronically she said that thing she most remembered was being laughed at\nBy Brett Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge who was allegedly in the room when this happened so there's a little bit of irony with the crowd laughing at her over the president's account so we should clear that up but I Wonder more to the point whether or not the White House has addressed those remarks\nLook I'm\nWas on stage just on the other day with Kellyanne Conway are asking her about these are the president's temperament and\nUh about her own revelations about sexual assault that had happened in her life and why she chose a to share that and and she ah acknowledged that she didn't choose to share that it just came out\nThe president's behavior is something that makes many people around the president United States today extremely uncomfortable [noise]\nThey have at the beginning of this process we're trying to be respectful to say that a doctor Ford needed to be heard and listen to or that they were important issues there and the president broke out of those constraints and we're sitting as I'm sure Susan Glasser and Eugene a\nWill will comment as well in a very extraordinary moment\nWhere many Americans and their experiences that have gone through with many other sexual assault victims in the past have kept quiet and said this week even Susan Collins who's now probably uh in in a position to vote 'em in in favor of a judge Kavanaugh\nHas has said you know people do not talk about this these are the the most under reported incidents and I like that just to Eugene ths comment about Kavanaugh's\nWall Street journal op ed that was written for one person that was written for not Donald Trump was written for Senator Flake Senator Flake\nBritain for not Donald Trump was written for Senator Flake Senator Flake at the Atlantic idea at the Atlantic festival this this week\nSaid that we could not have the kind of temperament that Kavanaugh showed on the Supreme Court he says we cannot have that on the court we just cannot and he was referring specifically to Kavanaugh going after senator after senator after senator after his very emotional opening statement\nAnd that was a message to give flake cover to also vote for Kavanaugh so we're sitting here where people are walking away\nFrom the allegations and uh the tunnel that many women and their partners and others supporting them feel about this being a shoved under the rug right while others are getting a I'm essentially\nFig leafs and passes to be able to vote for cabinet\nYeah he did have a lot of very sharp exchanges with senator Amy ... Patrick Leahy and and Dick Durbin and many of the Democrats who questioned him last Thursday fewer quick questions and then we'll we'll keep going let me get to some of your comments as well Virginia and in Washington DC writes democratic obstructionism\nMerrick Garland\nAnd Susan in Gainesville, Florida asks what on earth is the rationale for only one copy of the report a forty five pages being provided for review by one hundred senators\nSusan clearly a lot of things for voters to carry in they're not at all distant memories when they go to the polls in November go to the polls next month do we have any\nReal hard reliable sense is there any evidence of how much this may affect the mid term elections I mean a lot of what voters vote on in the midterms doesn't have to do with what happens in Washington sort of does a lot of that\nTerms doesn't have to do with what happens in Washington fellow does a lot of it has to do with what happens at home we have a sense of what the balance is looking like right now\nWell look first of all it does depend in fact on how this ends and ah there is an interesting argument to be made that if Kavanaugh is\nConfirmed a it's much more likely in a way to somewhat fate as an issue for Republican voters while\nA becoming an enormous rallying cry for Democrats and and conversely were he to go down\nA especially in such a spectacular fashion so close to the election there's already a sense and President Trump clearly feels is which is why he's been ... up his his voters over the last week on this he you know that we're having to go down that this would outrage a and an enrage\nRepublican base voters in a way that could prove beneficial especially in some of these key Senate races are in ... which is already taking place largely on a favorable to Republicans playing field this fall what's unusual about this\nDevice if we've had many divisive fights before a it strikes me that this is coming so close to a mid term election therefore injecting a volatile note of uncertainty with just weeks to go to the election number one number two a it is a cultural war being ignited arguably\nAmong Democrats and Republicans while\nBoth sides I I wrote last week about the two Americas that would listen to a the very jarring lead different accounts offered by Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh and uh would process this hearing it in a completely different way I think we've all watched that playing out over the last week a each a\nPolitical tried in our increasingly tribally divided culture has\nMikel tried in our increasingly tribally divide and culture has a whole different facts at a whole different narrative a whole different argument to make its inflaming passions on both sides are Republicans have made a lot over polls in recent days showing that\nA Republican voter enthusiasm which had been very low a very turned off in this midterm election year has sparked up words out over the last week you could argue well that's just that the election getting closer and we're not sure how much it has to do with cabinet but but my guess is that you know for different parts of the country\nUh this works entirely differently a politically\nMe get one more comment on this and then we will keep going of course we'll keep an eye on at the vote should be happening imminent leaps shorter only ... and all that goes but one more comment on this from Gary who wrote on our Facebook page\nSexual assaults aside Kavanaugh was not someone I saw as being even killed and being neutral making political statements during his opening yes he has qualifications on paper to be a justice however his temperament should be assessed\nLet's move on to some of the other big stories of big news this week including with immigration policy roughly three hundred thousand immigrants from El Salvador Haiti Nicaragua and Sudan have gotten a temporary reprieve\nAfter the Trump Administration threatened to revoke their temporary protected status TPS\nAnd\nFrom\nSupport for NPR I'm from the station and from Boehner with a bona certified craftsman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't demand that he has I think there are people who are have noticed how much wealthier he has gotten since getting in\nUm the White House and and regarding specific uh businesses if heads or some of the um hotels have been rented out by international organizations perhaps wedding to I'm Kerry good favor with the administration\nUm and I think there's some people who are concerned about how that could influence a policy foreign policy specifically\nWell it's been four years since the fatal shooting of black teenager look climbed McDonald by officer Jason Van Dyke in Chicago this week marks the end\nOf that closely watched trial has

O. X. P. O. P.\nIn the app store and we will share our conversation with the ... coming up next week on one a\nWhile to vote on the Senate floor has just happened were just double checking our numbers are out of what the vote total was again this is one of two votes that's involved in either getting Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court or not today's vote is a procedural vote to end the debate it's technically called cloture\nThe next vote would be the vote on whether or not senators would actually choose to put Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S Supreme Court\nWe heard just a few minutes ago that Senator Susan Collins Republican of Maine who might be a potential swing vote on this announced that she will side with her fellow Republicans on a critical past voted this cloture vote to end the debate\nWe're just double checking our numbers right now want to make sure we have the exact right vote total and as soon as we have that we will bring that to you for the moment we should get to one of Susan ... I ... she is literally leaping out of ... go ahead Susan ...\nWell it looks like we have the votes now from all four of the undecided senators going into at least on this cloture motion and interesting they Lisa Murkowski is the only one who was voted no so Joe mansion that Democrat from West Virginia has voted yes\nJeff Flake has voted yes Susan Collins has voted yes now Susan Collins however previously announced she was voting yes on the coach of ...\nSusan Collins however previously announced she was voting yes on the cloture vote but not to necessarily take that as an indication of her final stance on Kavanaugh because this afternoon at three PM she will announce her final decision so we don't know necessarily what this procedural votes me but I think it's quite significant\nAh to feed the Joe mansion yes vote in particular and Lisa Murkowski no vote\nIf those positions where to hold up in the final vote on Kavanaugh he would be approved\nLooks like there's still some voting going on maybe from senators who were struggling in and out of the room Steve Clemons once this cloture vote is done with eventually it will be done with what happens then what do we expect between this vote in the\nNext one will you'll have debate on the floor of that goes on they'll bring that debate too close and they will set a time most likely tomorrow I'm In which they will a vote to confirm or not judge Kavanaugh\nAnd that time it it could be any time during the day or is there like a particular windows hardly any\nMinutes I mean one of the things about this at it as it runs anytime I think one of the interesting things is you have\nA a senator from Montana or a Steve Gaines whose daughter is being married tomorrow getting married tomorrow and he wants to walk down the aisle so assured his vote be absolutely necessary they have to wait for him to get back from Montana so it's one of those life\nUh intrusions into the way of the system runs but my sense is that Mitch McConnell is obsessed with getting this done moving on and getting people out uh campaigning and\nNoting this as a success that they've achieved that's why this is so unusual that feel\nThis is a success that they've achieved that's why this is so unusual that feels raced pushed\nWhether it's the FBI investigation which many people have been saying has not been a exhaustive did not go into many corners it's because the clock is ticking for Mitch McConnell and I think he wants to shelve this and get this done as soon as possible yeah not one of these votes that you do one of these votes you have to do in person there is no app for that so certainly his\nHis uh his other life commitments could have a big impact the final vote total fifty one yes forty nine no and indeed as Susan said senators Collins flake and mentioned voted yes to suspend the debate and move on\nLisa Murkowski voted no but it seems like for the most part this was pretty much a party line vote Eugene Scott I don't think that we really expected it to go any other way than being essentially a squeaker right on party lines absolutely\nI think everything or just leading up to this moment suggested that even before the allegations against Kavanaugh became a public and I think uh there's a a ... a larger idea on that David Brooks tapped them\nOr to today and in his New York times piece about just how part is in the judicial branch has become um we talk often about activists judges um and concern that people on the bench for not making decisions and partially but we haven't seen that be the case for a while now and they simply appears to be a continuation of that\nI mean if I if I may Joshua one other element on this is that it was interesting to note that Heidi Heitkamp brother tweeted that she has to look at herself every day in the mirror and us chose to vote no even though he thinks it significantly increases the chances that she will lose her seat Joe Manchin the last time they\nIncreases the chances that she will lose her seat Joe Manchin the last time there was a a a reasonable poll in West Virginia is looking at Seventy percent of West Virginia is likely to vote support the Kavanaugh nomination\nSo the broader side in terms of the tectonics and the parties as they look at trying to take the Senate where the Democrats taking the Senate\nIs is also hedging on this that if mentioned were to be a no vote on Kavanaugh I think it it it very seriously could raise the stakes have him losing that state so there are different they're different issues here one is what what is the future prospects of\nA of the composite of the Senate look like with regards to this and despite the many many personal emotional and deep issues related to the capital nomination itself and this lifetime appointment but\nMany people are looking at high campus now or in a much more endangered position um and this probably uh if if mansion follow through with his position on on the vote tomorrow increases the chances that he will survive in November Susan\nI Would just I mean I think that that's our view right now uh but if Kavanaugh gets through as I think seems a tiny bit more likely after this culture of it than it did before because it seems to me that Joe Manchin seem somewhat more likely to vote yes on the nomination\nThan we might have known going into this cloture vote\nBut if if Kavanaugh gets through in the end\nI think Josh made this point early on to broadcast it may or may not actually\nProve decisive in any of these individuals Senate races or it's a ... in Alaska for example if Lisa Murkowski she's Republican she votes no but the Republican governor and lieutenant governor of her state have come out against cabinet they're particularly intense not necessarily even about the sexual\nIt's ten o'clock\n\n\nThey are among the world's highest honors for service to humanity and now we know the winters who's in this year's class of Nobel

A. M. U. dot org with regards to cyber hacking Michael asks with the loss and result in widespread dissemination of the CIA tool kit which allows one to spoof packing from another country how can cyber bread crumbs lead to certainty but in other countries actually guilty\nDavid what do you think well cyber attribution is something that people are getting a lot better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems\nTimes was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems ah years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern part of the U.S but the fact of the matter is that a combination of forensic evidence a\nMotive\nPast use a similar tools can catch you most of the way most of the time so there are some pretty good ways to go do it\nThe bigger question facing many governments is once they've found this out and perhaps decide one ounce it as happened in these most recent cases then the political pressures on them so what do you do about it\nThat's why the president signed a new set of executive orders and I'm\nIn August we haven't seen them they're all classified that pushes down into the system or the ability for commanders in the U.S to do cyberattacks back without having presidential sign off\nTill now that's been something that the only only the president to authorize the use of nuclear weapons and cyber weapons now it's not entirely clear that only he can authorize the use of cyber weapons in retaliation but you want to make sure you're attribution is pretty good before you strike back you know who to\nYeah great married before we move on\nFrom there first of all that is no small thing that that the U.S military might have the latitude unilaterally to shut down a power grid or turn off a hydroelectric dam through the Internet\nBut beyond that do we have a sense that certain countries certain organizations are getting a better handle on dealing with cyberattacks to world clearly hasn't figured this out is anyone making progress I think about that\nProgress I think about the ... because I hear so much about Internet regulations from there on a consumer level but\nOn a military level is anyone making progress\nOr not that I'm aware of the U.S I think it's still the world leader and in in terms of the you know advanced Internet abilities and and the threats are pretty clear or Russia or China and North Korea or Iran but\nA ... figuring out or response and how you want to calibrate that response so it doesn't become this open ended escalation and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond a you you're entering really uncharted territory\nVivian do we get a sense of countries beginning to kind of work together to figure this out to to figure out some kind of international response to cyber attacks or his Russia really got the whole world kind of running with here on\nThey say what we've seen in the last couple of days of coordination of um indictments and you know raising concerns about um spying and otherwise obviously there's a lot of discussions that are taking place\nWhere countries a western allies trying to coordinate some kind of effort to counter the threat that that the Russians posed but at the same time again you have so many uh restrictions and so many um uncertainty as to how to approach the cyber world in general in cyber threats\nUm as David said the U.S trying to really formulate some sort of attack plan or something to counter and to protect our infrastructure so that we don't have um we're not as vulnerable as we've seen ourselves\nIn the past but obviously you know the U.S is still trying to figure out a way forward I'm having looked at what happened to us and the two thousand sixteen election still we're talking about the fact that we are\nAnd the two thousand sixteen election still we're talking about the fact that we are vulnerable in two thousand Eighteen we could be vulnerable on twenty twenty so we haven't actually tried quite figured out how to protect ourselves get alone the world kind of coordinating on a global scale to do the same it's it's it's not an easy task\nAlthough it's funny kind of a decentralization of the way that we vote that we have so many different kinds of voting systems might in a way kind of how it helps allied health insulated from\n... to the fact that we've got all these different utility company yeah but you know don't but but the key element here is we've done a better job at discussing internally how we would do counterattacks than we have organizing the world than the sort of digital Geneva Convention of what standards of what's on limits and often it\nLet's shift gears and talk about the Nobel Prize is particularly the Nobel Peace prize the winners were announced this morning Dr Denis ... and ... one for their work combating sexual violence as a weapon of war\nThe announcement from the Nobel Committee said in part quote Dennis ... Luke ... is to help or who has devoted his life to defending these victims nutty a rod is the witness who tells the abuses perpetrated against herself and others\nWere rod is an Iraqi woman she was captured and held by the Islamic state escaped captivity after three months and told to her story in a book called the last girl\nDr ... founded a hospital in eastern Congo that treated thousands of women many of whom are survivors of gang rape ... pretty extraordinary people to be winning this prize especially as we've learned more about how sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war and has\nSexual violence is being used as a weapon of war and has for quite some time yeah really has to two individuals who seem really deserving the peace prize has been a lot of had a lot of controversy in recent years very politicized\nA couple of people who really been thrust into dangerous situations handles it with with incredible courage and Dr ... up built this hospital in eastern

from the Iran nuclear deal and um crackdown on Iran and kind of show that they're not messing around and so\nI'm basically this was just one more step in that process but as far as any real uh changes on the ground it really doesn't do much it's really just our sponsor\nTo um the international court of justice says ruling that uh that essentially said that sanctions that we they re imposing sanctions um we're not fair to Iran\nBring my we step back for just a second one is this treaty of amity [noise] uh I'm sure that was a question of the state department I just had this vision of some
