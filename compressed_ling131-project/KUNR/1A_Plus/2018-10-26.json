A. M. U. dot org\nAdam or go see a before we move on to our next story I Wonder if you could respond to that tweet from Michael that reads this just further reinforces that people solely look for media that confirms their already sent beliefs\nHow do we break out of this show people that does you disagree with are still human Adam\nBoy uh I don't know [laughter] I think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now\nOn the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms of civil discourse breaking down but a nice that's very real trend are actual substantive policy disagreements between Americans differences in fundamental values\nThat are really really wide and were perhaps paper to over for a lot of years by the media mano culture and now we're able to see them for what they are\nI Am personally kind of amazed that more political violence doesn't happen in the United states given the depths of these differences um I\nStates given the depths of these differences um I don't think it's just in how we talk and who we are talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing hears about fundamental differences in what we believe to be important in life and what we want government to do\n... we had fundamental differences forever in what we believe them but I think\nThis increase in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making the news the enemy of the people has made a difference and I think that people don't generally talk to each other anymore there's not enough people that go up I mean I\nBecause of because I'm a report I talked to everybody but I Will ask people did you vote why did you vote who did you vote for people don't talk anymore they look at their phones and they are in their little bubble\nAnd Eugene I think it's important to note that and I don't know if you encounter those\nWorking for the Washington Post but certainly I Do on a program that's on NPR is that the people who comments on our show or not just our fans are critics listened to I mean I understand the idea about the division but\nIf you hate NPR so much how do you know what we said on one aid to criticize us if you ate the Washington Post so much how do you know what was printed there to criticize it\nYeah and quite frankly I think that that\nA behavior is exemplified most\nFrom the president himself who really hate CNN but seems to watch a lot of it um and it and I I'm blown away by how many people are are engaging us who don't want us to do what\nIt is that we're doing and and it's unfortunate because I think we are a need criticism or the media needs to be criticized we need to be held accountable but we need to be criticized well so that we can serve the public better we're going to keep them\nWell so that we can serve the public better we're going to keep moving from the story again just a quick caution as you listen to the coverage of this story over the weekend please just remember that the stories moving really really fast we're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions\nAbout what has happened there already been some details of the story that had been clarified a walk back so that is common in a fast moving breaking story like this\nKeeping your on your NPR member station for the latest and an eye on NPR dot org ...\nA few more of your comments before we move on\nMatt emailed if Trump is responsible for the bombs are Democrats responsible for the shooter at the Republicans baseball team practice both of these statements are untrue believe mass referring to the the congressional baseball game in which Republican Congressman Steve ... of Louisiana was injured\nPhilip emailed the suspicious packages may have originated in Florida but the perpetrator or perpetrators tours are not necessarily based there the Unabomber lived in Montana but traveled to Utah and the bay area to physically male his devices in order to deceive law enforcement\nAll right let's keep moving on with some other stories and if the story continues to move in the next few minutes we'll certainly let you know but let's talk a little bit more about politics particularly with President Trump he was at a rally this week in Houston and he made headlines for a different set of remarks listen\nThat wants to do well frankly not caring about our country so much [noise]\nYou know what we can\nFashion\nNationalist and really\nWe're not supposed to use that word you know what I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nUsing Scott I Wonder if we can get to a clear definition of this term sheer what exactly is a nationalist I mean there's this ... is it typically consider to be what President Trump says it is\nKnowing and neither is global if I'm a according to President Trump to to be charitable or a nationalist it's just someone who puts America First um but the reality is anyone with a it's a historical context nationalism knows that it is a world view embraced on other rising I that has led to\nUm you know genocide and violence and separating people not like yourself or from a spaces that would give them rights that uh\nWe we deemed essential when important to human beings um and so a Trump you know early in his campaign I'm really distance himself from the term nationalist when we saw a Steve Bannon associated with it primarily because uh the ... the form of national let them about what's most\nAre familiar with ah banning and the brave our community west of white nationalism which we've seen um you know sweep Europe and I even hate groups in the states um and so it's it's been it's been deemed by most people to be problematic\nTo see Trump embrace it um while misrepresenting it or put him on the receiving end up significant criticism\nReduce the I'd love to chime in on this I Know that you are a stickler and right\nSee I Love you to chime in on this I Know that you are a stickler and rightly so for precision in language and I wonder what your take is on the use of the word nationalist versus say patriots\nParticularly because words like nationalist often heard in in phrases like white nationalism global list has kind of ... of being anti Semitic give us parse the words parcel language for us here\nI mean I think Eugene has already done a pretty good job of that I'm a I'm a little bit mystified by this whole story um the ... the idea that for President Trump to say hey I'm a nationalist is remarkable is kind of nuts to me um\nAmerica First his ... secondary campaign slogan is a perfect crystal ... of nationalism it's\nFor him to put a label on it is I think totally and consequential it would be like if President Trump got in front of a group of people and said hey my hair is kind of weird will die we all know that um I suppose it's sort of remarkable that you said it but you know it's it's it's a truth that is right in front of us\nI think a lot of why the comment has gotten the attention is that yes I'm as Eugene said um nationalism has a really really bad track record in the twentieth century of leading the genocide\nAnd a World War Z I'm On the other hand I don't I think that some people have been a rounding nationalist up to white nationalist and that's a pretty big trip\nNow you could make a very cogent argument that President Trump is functionally a white nationalist in terms of his rhetoric in terms of his policies that so that's an arguable point um but he didn't say I'm a white nationalist\n... point um but he didn't say I'm a white nationalist he said I'm a nationalist and he is manifestly so I don't get why this is a big deal\nA few of your comments about President Trump's word choices Mary hail emailed when Trump recently called for unity she did so in a tone but it's clearly not his usual one it is is if he was saying to his followers I don't mean this but they're making me say it his actions and word soon after showed that he really didn't mean it\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from

Administration has targeted the transgender community there's this ban on trans people serving in the military that's working its way through the courts of reality start Caitlyn Jenner published an opinion piece this week in response to this proposed changing the definition of sex by a church as in the Washington Post she wrote quote\nThe reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president's the leader of our nation has shown no regard\nPresidents the leader of our nation has shown no regard for an already marginalized and struggling community he has ignored our humanity he is insulted our dignity this is politics at its worst unquote\nNow usually we interviewed Caitlyn Jenner on this program some months ago and she said that she knows that a lot of conservatives are not very trans friendly but she appreciates it leads to being in the room and being able to talk to them about trends issues\nI also had to push back on her a little bit because she knows that people in the room clearly do not want her there\nWhat do you make of her comment I mean she can't be surprised by the president's actions on this she just can't you know it's\nBeen really fascinating she uh is arguably one of the most visible transgender people in America and um has actually been criticized significantly by\nThe transgender rights community because uh she does not seem to be deeply informed about the political history that the community has been a fighting for the idea that she likes to be at the table almost implies that no one has tried to be at the table before her\nUm and and the the administration has been criticized by the broader community perhaps a for not a being a a boat advocate of the transgender\nA community and and gender has been a critique for parents that have just noticed that\nOne of the things I most fascinated by a I think this story right here reveals how\nPeople in different or identity groups can listen to the same candidate and walk away with different things in general and wrote in that Washington Post op ed that seat back\n... wrote in that Washington Post op ed\nThat seat back Trump because she heard him include algae beat the communities and has a speech at the Republican National convention she saw people applaud and so she thought he would in bands algae beats he writes\nSocial conservatives voted for Trump because they believe he would reverse algae beat the rights that perhaps went farther than they would have liked them to go and the Obama administration so it's just one of those amazing moments about how different Americans here different things\nIt gets to a few of your comments before we keep moving Kirk emailed\nWhen was the meaning of gender changed to reflect the psychological state rather than a physical identity gender has always been a polite and more specific sending in for sex centers routinely used as such on birth certificates it seems that when we're talking about here is more accurately described as sexual identity rather than gender itself\nKirk I'll take this one on actually that's not correct your sexual identity has to do with attraction gender has to do with identity sexuality has to do with who you see yourself with\nGender has to do with who you see yourself\nAs one more story related to the ... community today the remains of Matthew Shepard are settled in their

President Trump sent troops to the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis is authorized deploying eight hundred more troops\nTo the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the the ...\n[noise] well it it really is as car ruined was pointing out apply of thoughts to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to the to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also is is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping or countries like Honduras and El Salvador\nGuatemala where there is\nTourists in El Salvador Guatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor they they as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nOn their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives\nIn the United states they think that that children would have better lives and really there is no greater testament to American soft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with their feet and come to the the the United states in ... ah and have children and have better lives than simply\nAnd and so the troops are part of this larger\nA Trump in ... and I guess Republican rhetoric\nThat play into the the idea that some migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as sources of great danger when in ... in fact a you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they are anything but\nAnd I also do want to point out uh current mentioned that President Trump alluded to the ... a A R mentioned that uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there's actually no evidence that points to the fact that they could be Middle Eastern but perhaps more importantly\nHe was using um Middle Eastern as a slur of sorts which which\nWe ... we should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence said that there it's possible that mixed in with these thousands of migrants who were from Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know ... ... ferry is aims for the country\nYou know ... ... ferry is aims for the country\n... and that's exactly right thank you for the car for vacation that but the the point I was getting too is that the use of the of of a Middle East and as the um it is extremely dangerous because it it it it then tries to create the the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at as Carlin was pointing out again a movement that happens very often or you know migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states\nAnd the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now numbering in the thousands is because it has been politicized here in the United states\nGoldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful with language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments or to us about that with these this terminology including the use of the word migrants\nMaria writes I Am Honduran I was born and raised in Honduras I came to the U.S to study and now I live and work here this quote unquote caravan is a cry for help cry of desperation from my people who will risk their lives to escape the extreme poverty and violence that I Know Israel\nThey are indeed refugees seeking refuge please don't blame them blamed the corruption that has rotted the Honduran government\nAnd dug in Anthony tweet they are not migrants they are asylum seekers words matter now Michael Merriam Webster is might go to in terms of the English language Merriam Webster defines a migrant as one who\nMerriam Webster defines a migrant as one who migrate such as a person who moves regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops a refugee is one that fleas\nEspecially a person who flees to a foreign country or power to escape danger or persecution what do you make of the words that we're using to describe this\nYou know just it was as you've been talking about this I I I suddenly had Woody Guthrie's old song\nAbout about a group of migrants being sent back to Mexico in the Nineteen thirties and their plane crashed\nAnd they were cold deportees it's a beautiful song you you look it up and I mean listeners should strict YouTube after the show and and give it a listen there are many versions of it\nYeah you you know look I and I do think that in this case there there is a distinction you know we have a human wave coming out of sub Saharan Africa and the horn of Africa towards Europe and it's had a destabilizing effect on politics here as well\nAt eight three sixty seconds straight with reception on Tuesday the thirtieth at seven pm\nThat's the potential is workshop [noise]\nSupport for NPR
