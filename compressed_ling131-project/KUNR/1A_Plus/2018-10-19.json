Bo of applied economic research here in New Hampshire before we keep going and introduce our next guests I just want to kind of add a yes any men to what then deal you just said\nThere is no shame and getting a career that doesn't require a college degree none\nAnd we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of these skilled trades that requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute\nFor workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job you\nAnd he put a question and answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work once you do you consider taking one where do you go to find one you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures without a four year degree\nOn line at the one a dot for that's the word ... the number one\nAnd at the one a dot for that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org before we bring in our next two guests rush one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing as a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is it just an aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways and that well I think the main thing that is\nThat what she right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year as sort of lagging this prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs just to get by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reversed course and start becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that they're in lies to crunch\nGlad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management have been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted like ... billion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage\nIn jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see with short my education and pay a third of what his manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome thank you for inviting me\nRyan can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture is we've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure well I I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now a and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nAh and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places\nAre at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently that describes how over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nAsked members of our one a text club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at aged Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a rut\nSeventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now as being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nI think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity in the national data a that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages\nAs employers compete for workers and we just having observe that you know overall real wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins are for example a wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions going a bit faster in New England in the Pacific states but ah but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that that's all to say that\nThey were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nHeard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who worked for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field or it's enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nThere aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nWas show emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car and wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the the minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised fears we're at the national minimum wage thousands traveled to Massachusetts daily were the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you were dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\nOr [noise] well I I don't have any empirical data on why so many uh employees are working in mass and traveling there but I Know when I Lived there that they reported over half a million or can eaters everyday into the city and out um and then many of those are coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we have and to the jobs that are out there\nWhat do you see the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\n... that\nYou know I I feel like you know my point of view is I'm sort of a wider industry perspective in in the sense that I worked in technology for the last ten years and coming to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high demand um occupation such as automotive construction\nManufacturing they're just seem to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's in manufacturing or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about the nature of will be described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed to all the companies\nJing workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed to all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we are not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a\nHuge salary Jan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester they've been out of work for at least six months\nI've overheard conversations at my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen year olds ages them is a big problem\n... how do you see this to the impact of\nOf older workers especially in in high tech careers especially in like Silicon Valley\nIt's becoming worrisome at this point where if you're old we've just decided we don't want you\nYeah I think that's that here in New Hampshire it's kind of like a to a degree that's less of a problem than it may be in Silicon valley for example because if you don't\nHire and retain older workers of chances are you're not going to get any workers because our our states as I said our median age is the second highest in the country so\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Carnegie Corporation of New York supporting innovations in education

station\nBack now to our conversation with Russ T. Bo and Ryan not let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled\nChris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want experienced people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed overtime wheels\nLower wage entry level employees up to speed over time we also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voicemail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics and we're out and supply chain industry\nAnd we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months\nAnd we were really struggling with two items one is employed turnover where there are chasing higher wages and and new facility is a new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade jobs shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your abandoning your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to stem their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's\nA city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers to the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAnd accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan was the idea of Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to want to say thanks Joshua so this\nClare county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to winning thanks Joshua so this is called the come home award ... tell us what the come home award is how does that work\nYou know they come home award program that we launched in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship business models on their head um there are too many flaws in in traditional scholarships to talk about and doing that but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we've flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly upon completion of some kind of degree but only if he returned to our region to live and work and it's really on home home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair county\nYeah we have a very strong preference for\nThose was family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that if they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county pay me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of Lake Huron in St Clair river um our largest town of port Huron has a population of about thirty thousand people\nWe do not have a four year University in our region we did not have a fortune five hundred company in our region a thirty percent of our workforce leaves are counting heads down in metro Detroit to to be employed but they love the small town life or the family friendly environment in the manatees are were small town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside of Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet ... which is great for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged on the economic health of regions like port Huron are Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right\nI think is better judged on the economic health of regions like port Huron are Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true health\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people here they're pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come on program was once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was philanthropies government business\nAny other sector we realize that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan\nIt had to be an organic planned that drove our prosperity\nSo Randy told me how to come home award work suppose I'm from saint Clair county and I moved to Chicago for work and now I'm considering coming back and how does that work\nChicago's a great example Chicago Austin's south um as long as you do not have primary residence here so let let's say your parents still live in this region maybe completed college six years ago and you're still living in Chicago but you met someone you met them partly the medicine they've got other you're you're weighing the option of staying in Chicago which is a great place to live\nOr you want to come back home settled down started family spend more time doing what you want to do as long as you don't already live back in our region\nOr you're eligible for Fifteen thousand dollar award if you're selected we give the recipients a hundred and twenty days to establish a permanent residency or they have to find a job that they don't already have won several already have jobs lined up\nAnd then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as the carrot to keep you here\nAnd it's really a simple back then scholarship we pay the loan holder directly which in every case\nUs has been the federal government so\nHolder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo how do you so you you pay it out a little bit overtime so by over time by the time the two years or up\nSt Clair county voted this program to come home award will have put in Fifteen thousand dollars towards one's debt I'm guessing it's like would that be three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars like every six months or so and it adds up to Fifteen thousand overtime\nThat's exactly Joshua and the goal you know I'm is to really give young people actually young they can be in their twenties or thirties or forties I'm the chance to go two or three years without making that\nNationally I Know you see data that says the average college student has thirty thousand dollars in debt I don't know where they're getting that data Josh because out of the fifty plus applications we received our average at an eighty thousand dollars ... that's\nThat's a crippling amount of debt that's preventing people from living the American dream\nI can relate to that I'd finally paid off my private student loans I had to settle them it was [noise]\nOh God it was it was the most awful form of financial slavery I can possibly imagine and definitely like that's a whole other our where I Will I Will ... will you with my tearful story of dealing with Sally Mae before I I Know ... wants to jump in but before he does Randy I just want to\nAsk you about some of the perception issues that we discussed with regards to New Hampshire\nThere's this there ... there is evidence that young people are moving to a bigger cities in in large numbers\nYou've talked a lot about this feels kind of small town America New Hampshire specifically conquered for sure definitely feels like small town America do you think there's this misperception about smaller communities that young people are getting I haven't seen the TV show\nThat kind of glorified young people in a small town since dawson's creek I mean you don't see it much anymore do do you think people are just getting the wrong\nThe creek I mean you don't see it much anymore do do you think people are just getting the wrong idea about living and working in smaller parts of the country that we're all just kind of dazzled by the big city\nYou know and that's that's a great point I was when I speak around the country about this program in this effort of talent attraction there is a complete misperception that young people don't want to move to a small town America\nI'm One of the biggest impacts of this programming is dispelling that no I'm not saying ten thousand young people a year want to move to a small town America New Hampshire or this part of Michigan but we've already had far more applications for this program that we can possibly find\nOur region needs to realize there is a is a growing interest in coming to small town America they just happened to be out of our line of sight right for people in my age so it's really just dying that meant New Hampshire has a lot to offer and there are young people that will move back home we have to be open the how do we make that transition ...\n... point seven in Ninety One point seven tell you when are we now in Ninety One point by paying the the L ...\nBringing you win our dot org ah\nHere in

A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments including some of your commenting about this Elizabeth Warren's story Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because it's\nAmerican voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren released this DNA results\nYou showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares and hearing the story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to Andy's comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in some of these arguments that's what fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that's what could help Republicans on sort of succeed in the midterms\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the high road still seems to be the best tactic but we'll see how things play out\nGo ahead and it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandros saying look this is what happened in two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio J uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook 'em out um and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and that's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party\nIn the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at the staff Josh will if\nYou look at the way in which um you know a parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections I founded telling that the guest said they've brought up\nA typically these would be people you know our presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael ... and Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've the people who've drawn the most attention of the people who have cast themselves as Trump antagonist and\nUh the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know the mid term to appear lose their favorite sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week\nHe democratic he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke people are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight and overworked came out swinging in the debate\nHe even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at what point at one point Franco or ... what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate um you know I think\nYou have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in the midterms typically you know not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there is a major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which on election day of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think an undercover aspect\nOf this race is the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go and market box for Republicans\nAnd the strength of the Republican Party overall the strength of governor grab Greg Abbott for instance who's running you know against ed a Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties um seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if better over work has been able to keep them to single digits\nI was going to make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ... Republican and it automatically towns that vote dress counting for all the Republicans on the ticket\nYet you can basically built for every Republican all at once I'm this is the last election that there'll be doing straight ticket voting after that uh it won't be as easy\nWill fundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they were on Monday and the results\nLook pretty good for Democrats and house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fundraising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers outraged Ninety two Republican incumbents more\nThan ... the Democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars the courts in the Senate Democrats are also out raising Republicans ... raised thirty million\nThey're also out raising Republicans ... raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races\nAlso glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas Karen tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nThere are still people missing there's still people who are trying to pick up their lives\nUm you know I think the town in Mexico beach has not report it given any numbers\nUm of how many people are are missing a but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this\nWas a massive storm I'm Talking about one of the biggest storms out of the top three or perhaps by some accounts that you know had made landfall that would make it bigger than Katrina\nThis has been a huge effort many people still do not thousands still don't have a phone service on and people are expecting asked film is sewn services restored and more roads are clear it and you're able to get more to people that they're expecting the death toll to continue to rise\nAnd you're able to get more to people that they're expecting the death toll to continue to rise\nWhen Alexander the other big issues when people can actually start\nTo rebuild I mean it's it's fascinating and terrifying horrifying at the same time to look at some of the early drain camera pictures that from where hurricane Michael came ashore from where it made landfall\nYou can almost tell which homes were built up to the latest building codes and which homes were not because of homes that were up to codes were there and the homes that weren't were gone and I wonder what points the the ... the rebuilding effort is right now is there any effort is there any expectation on when people could start to rebuild\nSunday a great forecast for northern Nevada and eastern California [noise]\nSo the world is beckoning for you to get out there and enjoy this weather's weekend certainly hope you do [noise]\nK.

A. M. U. dot org Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire [noise]\nNational races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire the race in district one will be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress\nHis Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district that Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen right\nAbsolutely frightening and a party to party from two thousand eight or the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats winning in presidential years is now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's retiring I'm In ... where do you have people who are\nRunning really within the mainstream of their parties are pappas has been serving in various\nElective offices for a long time he's in his late thirties he says family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester often to stop for presidential candidates\nHe um he comes from Manchester which is a town that where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters\nUm Eddie Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time led the states uh enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores liquor is controlled by the state uh it was a fairly big job he a random enforcement division and he's been a police chief\nUm you know they were pretty much keeping to well within the norm to their party Eddie Edwards has you know embrace Donald Trump he every Giuliani up here campaigning with them [noise] um and he's\nIf you're campaigning with them um and he's in some ways tried to cast Chris Pappas those you know part of some sort of resistance movement and saying we've got to see the nationally uh you know Chris Pappas is\nHardly a radical guy or you know family run restaurant a worker I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um\nEnd of this race is one where the seat can go either way and both parties believe they have a shot\nWas also a gubernatorial race underway here at the Republican government Governor Christie new new faces Democrat Molly Kelly she's won a Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number\nThe latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that tallied the Democrat has outraged Sununu the incumbent Republican three to one uh ... brand of New York came to conquered on yesterday to help a campaign for Kelly\nThey met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave I'm interested in where this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but here as part of what happened with your ... brands listen\nIt's going to help families be happier and how we're going to help people be more productive at work and so\nIt's a win win everywhere I go in this day I hear about the need for paid family medical leave and how important it is for people\nTo be able to have the choices in their life to be able to work hard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they love the most when they're needed them out\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end\nAnd now that was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator ... was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is this paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will\nIt's been a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting tests to me she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue um it's a challenge to somebody covering the first how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue he was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it\nAt the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction imagine to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\n'em in the Democrats believe this is a need for that works for Raleigh Kelly by dint of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who work your way through college and that you know ... new new sort of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh\nYou know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get at New Hampshire has kind of a bifurcated economy uh\nUh you know boom times for people the upper income we have budget surpluses and tax collections are up but you know the wage growth for people at the lower end of the scale\nHas not been great and this is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race well I'm ... you know ... when we do we have to your terms here\nYou know ... should when we do we have to your terms here no governor's been promised after one term\nUh since two thousand four and prior to that it had been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those uh here polling indicates it's a new news up by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers and\nMolly has outrageous person in three to one in the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch of this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent with a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he he'll free ... doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only got he's got four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand no interest groups will will add to that in terms of advertising but this is a race Democrats feel they have a chance to win if if a blue wave a venture weights and they think that ... uh buy\nDinner background but it'd be a woman is somebody who perhaps his best engineered to kind of ride away speaking\nOf nationally known names Frank or don't is I Wonder what your senses of senator Jill brand making this trip to help Mali Kelly is there is speculation about her future maybe twenty twenty\nThere's a lot of speculation about her future and twenty twenty on I think how much is kind of resonate as as the big question I mean obviously\nA there's so many names being kicked around ah right now or that you know it I think time will tell but there there's no question that killed granted one of the people that that people are talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move\nOr that she makes 'em as being picked apart um you know analyzed a and looking for it\nUm you know analyze a and looking for it how it could mean and how it could uh what impact that could have on twenty twenty\nLots to discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because the Treasury Department revealed this week but the deficit has grown\nLast year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred and sixty six billion this week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars it's a six year high end projection say it is on track by the end of this decade\nTo hit a trillion dollars the deficit a trillion dollars\nNow Alexander some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being responsible for this particularly the tax bill\nPart of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts is it by cutting taxes business what kind of unleash more productivity the economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest would more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out so far\n... well we haven't seen that yet certainly an ... fan is Republicans are arguing that that's going to take 'em you know about a decade to even out though at this rate although the economy is booming there's there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at at this point\nUm it was sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around was welfare reform um to to cut down on the deficit and that conversation has started again on Capitol Hill\nI'm that obviously won't move forward until after the midterms but there is conversation about to get\nThat the midterms but there is conversation about to get you know starting to work on a welfare reform bill that would cut some public benefits um like Medicare that kind of thing\nUm and so going forward you know it's interesting to hear or to see Republicans silence on this issue when they were previously the party of deficits but it's also an opportunity for them politically to push another priority of the Republican Party which again has welfare reform\nYeah I'm Glad you mentioned that because Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blamed the rising deficit on public assistance programs in an interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday what's going on with\nThat it's very disturbing and it's it's ruined by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid\nThat Seventy percent of what we spend every year the subject we were just discussing the funding other government is about thirty percent of what was ... there's been a

turkey has not released the recordings\nWant to remain anonymous turkey has not released the recordings but there have been leaks of what's in them Turkey's government is not above repression and this kind of nefarious behavior themselves what exactly are we supposed to do as an uninvolved third party\nBefore I let you respond to that ... tweeted an uninterested third party hardly ... was a legal permanent us resident with children who are us citizens the usa using interested party even if Trump is not interested in the euro would you respond to that [noise]\nAbsolutely I think it's right that were not an uninvolved third party this man was a resident he\nWas not only that he was a columnist for a prominent American newspaper the Washington Post\nAnd let's be honest that a lot of the reason this has gotten so much attention in this country is because the post has rightly put a huge and hot spotlight on it and not let anyone forget about it and you know other newspapers in the United states and world media have picked up on it too and really kept the attention on it I was struck\nBy President Trump saying yesterday when he finally acknowledge that yes it appears this man was murdered that he said this story has captured the world's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it it is the job of the media to demand accountability to seek truth\nAnd our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world part of that is about moral values\nAnd when we have a very close ally who by the way our military hardware is used in that Saudi campaign in Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians\nIn Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians and children and is now leading to a huge famine in Yemen how can we say that worrying uninvolved party um you know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies\nAnd it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who is alleged to have done something like this we have certain forms of leverage that include arms sales than include potential sanctions right and many other things\nI Will say though I I'd James I do\nKind of feel worse Sonja is coming from in a way because and we've talked about this on this program before the U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship\nBut we've never tried to exert strong moral or ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that one is an entangled but I kind of take Sony's point like the U.S\nDoesn't really want to have to spank Saudi Arabia over its actions because there is a tremendous military and economic entanglements so\nI'm not really sure what the us has the power to do or if it has the moral authority to do it\nWell this is the limit ... the lea amplify that point Joshua because it's absolutely critical you know someone who's been actually a very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point in them paraphrasing here\nThat all the money in the world and all of this military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalists for their opinions that's an international norm there's a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's a critical one\nI mean the show is called ... for the first amendment ... that is in our DNA to stand\nCalled ... for the first amendment ... that is in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world and if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a Senator Rubio said will never be able to buy our credibility back\nOn these issues Senator Lindsey Graham made a very similar point he was so angry and he said I've been a huge ally as NBS in Saudi Arabia but I'm never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan issue\nThan have it is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published\nWhat is believed to be ... final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and Arabic and he writes about the systemic the systematic dismantling of the free press in much of the Arab world here's one brief quote from that column quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as\nA result Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate unquote Hayes what do you think is he right\nI think he is definitely right so uh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region is\nThat oftentimes strategic interests have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues under the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but if not indeed we never halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia or despite the ongoing\nSales to Saudi Arabia or despite the ongoing campaign in Yemen we never a threatened to sanction them over a they're a you over their funding of jihadism other extremist in Syria we never have really taken very strong action against Saudi Arabia or any\nAny country or any country in the region for their actions except for Iran who has been fundamentally aligned against the Gulf ... a Gulf states so I I I completely agree with the sentiment in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nBefore it it's I Hope that we have the fortitude to actually the people in ... that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually pass some sort of legislation that or does something if the Trump Administration does not but it seems unlikely given the history of the issue\nSo basically the people who killed ... may get away with is that he may never really know who killed him there may never be any real prosecution because of just the cold hard fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis is a business relationship\nAnd you you've totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been roped killers who took out to show G and reporting earlier this week that said that the U.S has actively working with the Saudi Government to try and come up with some sort of feasible solution that admits the death of his show gee but does not blame Mohammed bin Salman\nA coach or just broken I coming out of that because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to to Saudi Arabia was to say that look um\nTo to Saudi Arabia was to say that look\nUm you have to get out in front of this this is that you cannot sleep to some of the rug I'm absolutely convinced we are going to get to the bottom of this because there's just so much evidence that the Turks now have\nThey've photograph these Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve of which are part of the ... the crown princes security detail or intelligence services I think we're going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a fall guy but somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that maybe they're going to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral Ahmed Asiri as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to ... you know offer up a a senior scapegoat but I'm I'm pretty convince we're going to figure out what happened here\nWell we will keep an eye on this story we're glad to get some more of your comments on this for now let's move on to some of the other big stories that make news this weekend may have flown under your radar because of all the attention about ... rightly given of course\nBut there's also an update from Afghanistan where the war continues to rage Seventeen years after it began with no clear end in sight yesterday the Taliban killed at leading police chief in Kandahar the commander of us and NATO troops in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller escaped\nUnharmed today the Afghan government announced it's delaying

least\nTen candidates and scores of voters in the ... give us some sense of how\nOf voters in the ... give us some sense of how the Taliban's efforts might affect the outcome of this election voter

buzzfeed do still a little more time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from around the world one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThis week some Americans were probably green with envy at our neighbors to the north\nRight about now\nI Know you've got a job\nThey were celebrating in Montreal this week because on Wednesday Canada legalized recreational marijuana nationwide it's only the second country in the world to do so worldwide was the first in twenty Thirteen Andrew tweeted Canada legalizing we'd was like California legalizing we'd both were like\nWe'd like California legalizing we'd both were like a long relationship where you've been dating forever but just dominated official Hays how big a deal is this and do you think this is the start of a Global Trends something that has just kind of been understood for a long time and just hasn't been made official yet\nYou know that's a great question because I'm not really sure I mean I think that\nWhen you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal\nThan at you compare that to things like the un officer drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that it you know marijuana is this evil so it's really tough to tell where the global feeling is on we legalization\nIf um you weren't you bring it up say at a meeting in the European Union's\nOf European Parliament then I'm guessing you still would not have nearly a majority of people in favor it even in a place like the USO Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana which he did it doing now compared to you know being a private business\nOr that private but illegal business among many small dealers\nOr it depends on how it affects the global drug trade and whether\nUh there's going to be any sort of shift in you know\nI'm sure that can is gonna be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether it causes a surgeon traffic accidents where the costs asserted tops realization or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada\nYeah the CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance\nAbout how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers on driving stone it is of course worth noting that in this country marijuana is considered the most illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there\nWith heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use\nAnd the high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd Owen who was an official with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIt possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint where I had smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all and to the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's Todd oh one of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was this updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things packed them on to NAFTA and set it snapped a to point out but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know this people are saying that essentially this is a potential marijuana mess right now I'm so I think this could be an issue because we certainly do not have legalized marijuana across the United\nBecause we certainly do not have legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis\nI Wonder also James what other kinds of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean\nJustin Trudeau now has to kind of owned is whether it's seen as a good move\nOr a negative moved there remains the question as to what legalization of the national level mind me for Canada on top of that there are early reports that suggested supplies are running low because candidates takes time to cultivate the point of being syllable and there are long lines around the block and things are running out supplies running out\nI Wonder what kinds of additional unintended consequences we might keep an eye out for a\nWhile you know the Canadian Medical Association journal called this a an uncontrolled experiment so we're going to we're going to find out a lot of things about this but I must admit that I'm not\nThat surprised when you can walk into the major states the United states like Colorado or California and there's dispensaries for recreational marijuana everywhere I I think this is a trend that's happening\nAll over the United states and it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna keep going because people are going to realize that there's a lot of money to him in may when you tax marijuana\nA and they use has happened in any way and putting these people in jail is probably not the best use of public funds so I I see is part of a continuum I think it was kind of inevitable that are progressive neighbors to the north we're probably going to get a jump on this on this\nBut um you know I I just been struck by going around the country and see in states where this is already happening and everyone kind of shrugs it's not a big deal\nYou know this doesn't seem James to have the kind of energy I mean it's not like the fight of love against prohibition you know where it was considered this major like its issue about liberty and of course it helped spur of the rise of organized crime if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this ...\nMm if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this feels very much like something that was just kind of a matter of time like if they legalize it was going to happen sooner or later\nThat's my sense too yeah that is the trend is pretty clear in this country and and Canada can has had medical marijuana says two thousand and one it's very popular so too does not out on a whim a by endorsing the so I I think it's a it's kind of inevitable\nYeah not one of the loudest most aggressive social movements with regards to the legalization of cannabis a much more impactful movement that has reverberated around the world is the me too movement and we should talk about that before our time is up this week MJ Akbar who's the minister of state for external affairs in India\nLeft that post after more than a dozen women accused him of\nSexual assault and harassment also in India this week there were protests and violence meant by that meant any woman trying to enter the ... temple in ... state in India groups of conservative Hindu men threw stones and attacked women and journalist who tried to get too close let's start\nWith the story involving energy Akbar Hays how have we seen the me too movement play out\nIn India or is this just kind of the beginning of its effect on men in power\nI think so it's it's interesting because the me too movement really kicked off here in the United states a year ago and for a while uh I Know that our reporters at least we're watching Indian waiting and wondering when is it going to affect this culture where\nUh we were so sure that it would finally have an impact and now a in recent weeks at has finally like grab the country and shaking it\nFinally like grab the country and shaking at\nA we've seen as all started with one actress or one Bollywood actress coming forward and just it's been a tidal wave of accusations sense than women taking to Twitter and being unafraid to name their alleged abuse abusers and assaulted by name\nAnd just being really willing to step out and do what the Indian courts haven't done before which has tried to bring these men into account\nAnd um it's it's really interesting that ... one of the first to go considering um he had such a long run in the Indian journalism seen ... and\nUh the most the women who came forward about him were fellow journalists were fellow reporters so I feel like that is a bit of credence to these allegations and we'll see whether in the future they uh\nThe women who are I guess lower down on in social status will finally start to be believed as well\nWith regards to the protests of the ... temple in terrible estate the BBC's James Gleason was they're asking people why they were protesting here's what one man said\nNo no no no no no no no the media and it turns out to making it ... they don't really want to do just do what they wanted to religion that's the only thing these\nSome of what the BBC's dreams Clinton was told in Carol estate outside the ... temple there in ... I Wonder what your sense is of this protest particularly what the gentleman said it made it sound as if there's this external pressure from the median politicians they want to destroy our culture they wants to destroy our religion he said\nTo destroy our culture they want to destroy our religion he says\nWell obviously that's not true let's I mean it's the most obvious part of that is that ... Modi who is the prime minister of India is from a fairly far right Hindu nationalist party so he's clearly not trying to destroy the culture and the religion", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Reno", "day": "19"}
