time for a special series ahead of the midterms called the state we're in\nThis week we're looking at state trends in laws on unions involving the public sector workforce like teachers firefighters and government employees they make up one of the most heavily unionized sectors of America's workforce\nThey make up one of the most heavily unionized sectors of America's workforce\nBack in June the Supreme Court passed a ruling that could make it harder for unions to secure labor contracts through a process known as collective bargaining the ruling affects more than twenty states and the consensus is it the decision will hurt unions financially and could lead to a further decline in membership\nAhead of that ruling some blue states took steps to protect organized labor what impact will all of this have on the labor movement and what impact does it having on election season\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Scott Greenberger executive editor of state lie a journalism project of the Pew Charitable trusts Scott welcome back to what I thanks very much for having me let's get some definitions out of the way first of all when we say collective bargaining what are we referring to\nUh when we say collective bargaining or what we are talking about our negotiations between uh employers and a group of employees are on salaries benefits working conditions and the like and typically employees are represented by unions\nKind of basic wages and working conditions exactly now a number of states have a right to work laws on the books are they're called right to work states what exactly do we mean by right to work\nSo a right to works a states and there are about I think twenty seven twenty eight of them now are they prohibit labor unions and employers from requiring workers to pay union dues as a condition of employment\nAh and of course a union dues are extremely important because that enables the unions to not only um conduct the negotiations during collective bargaining but also a to engage in other activities um including a political activities so if you\nSeventies um including a political activities\nSo if you are at a job\nAt a a union covered workplace typically you know in in in a non right to work state you get that job and you join the company and they say hey will convince job recovered by union here's your initiation fee you need to pay\nIn a right to work state you can get the job and say no thanks I'm not eager to pay for this but I look forward to starting work that's right\nHow does union membership look in the U.S right now are we talking mostly about public sector workers like teachers more private sector workers like hotel workers some of whom are on strike right now what's the overall picture\nSo uh this picture has changed dramatically in the last several decades it used to be in this country that most ah when we talked about unions we were talking about private sector unions\nBut a union membership overall has declined significantly over the last several decades and now\nPublic sector employees make up a larger share of the unionized workers in the United states so right now about a third of public sector workers and we mean we say public sector sector workers we're talking about teachers police officers firefighters\nAnd from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nIs one a I'm Joshua Johnson this summer the Supreme Court ruled that public sector employees have a First Amendment right not to pay union for collective bargaining unions called as unfair because non union workers benefit from the contracts that can be reached to collective bargaining but now won't have to pay for that\nSome blue states saw this decision coming in preemptively pass legislation to protect unions from the high court's ruling were discussing that and more issues related to state laws on unions with Scott Greenberg executive editor of state line Sarah Duncan is still with us on the line she's a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates and she has a K. through eight visual arts teacher\nSarah there was one more thing I did want to ask you before we had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners\nAbout their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in granted\nEvery teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in granted I Can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nI'm a member of the teachers union and while I Do appreciate all the things that the union negotiations for us on our behalf one salary health insurance all that kind of stuff\nUm I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent it higher level Caesar accountability that would ultimately lead to higher salaries more competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers achieved tenure that's negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThere were unable to continue to drive competition in the teaching marketing and ultimately compare ourselves to other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with Sarah I'm Wondering what you think of John's commented does he have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and I'd like to make a couple of comments about that um first off\nI've not always been happy with everything that my union is done but one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers\nThe union is not just your union leaders Indian movements are driven by numbers and lenders and need to demand\nAnd you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices um it's actually not\nThat difficult to fire a teacher but what unions has done is made it clear that you can't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe than you have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or you know and\nPart of the reason that so important is because teachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay\nYou know and part of the reason that's so important is because teachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they\nMake higher salaries and you you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore I let you go see her I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates in and try to work with the other delegates about improving policies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think the residents of your state\nOr really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they weren't motivated than I Wonder if it would have taken the strike to make things happen in West Virginia\nI think that they are I'm not evaded and I do believe that that is why the strike was so successful we could not have done what we did without the support of our communities and I think that our communities realize you know it was portrayed in the media is that the strike was just it out hey are just about health care it's not about that\nNot just about that it's about improving conditions for students for teachers for families and for working people in general um I have seen with my own eyes legislators repeatedly putting interests that outside corporate interests over their own people in this state and that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a candidate for the west Virginia House of building it's also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate you making time for thanks very much thank\nYou without a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed I don't think workers should be forced to join a union but also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts\nNon union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways Luke tweeted how we\nYou can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fair equitable enough unions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers\nScott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland comment about non union members going it alone and individually to go shooting just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want but a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions\nRight I Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of variation from state to state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um uh uh differences that you're talking about\nI Know someone that we should put that question too I think is an expert on down in ... and she's joining us NYC in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U.S Randy welcome to want to say hey Joshua\nAnd that Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members and I she's running in and very ... district and I hope she makes that point of the three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to you a little bit more about that in a moment I should also contract I actually I Know the union contracts I said also introduced Vincent for new CIO he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\nHey thank you for having me on friendship of us use me Randy before we continue could I just put that question to you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity I collect\nTo you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is a floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA is to say these are at least the minimum working conditions and wages right\nWell um it's in in some in some industries it's a floor now the ceiling\nIt depends on what the clause is about ... flu city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes is for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay good that's that's that's a good con a context for folks maybe who never been in a union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage me very Vincent you you said that the oral arguments in the Janice case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house so\nWell that's right but before we get to that let's just go back and to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country\nAll right to work all Janice means is that a union can't get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect collective bargaining in any other way unions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions\nAnything they could before right to work before ...\nThey can negotiate for after it except for the ability to say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired\nAnd going back to that contract is a a floor and not feel like uh the vast majority of collective bargaining agreements especially those are the public sector have\nAlready of collective bargaining agreements especially those are the public sector have seniority built in or the only way to get a raise is by law get other your other job hey I'm ... and all the way to go ahead and finish off\nUm so I I I actually agree with Bill um you know workers should have the ability to negotiate individually if they want to the Mackinac center has model legislation it's called the workers choice that allows public employees to fully opt out of union representation represent themselves and negotiate a better contract if they can\nIf union worker and if workers don't pay unions to negotiate for them how can that not have an impact I mean you have to pay the staff to negotiate for you right\nOr the problem is that they are forced to accept that representation whether they want it or\nNot I don't know I hear you on that I I I hear you on that piece I just want to make sure we're clear on the argument you're making if the staff to go shoot your contract is paid and there are workers who choose not to pay into that staff how could that not have an impact I mean you got to pay these people right well it's a staff\nIs doing good job I mean I worked for a contract for nonprofits and they raised there and they raise the revenue by doing good job and having um their supporters realize they're doing good job proving that are worth to their supporters\nAnd out raising money that way so if the unions are doing good job I'm like we've seen in right to work states like we are seeing now after Janice if they prove they're worth to their membership\nAnd they're going to be able to raise that revenue but if they're not then that should be the workers right to say no I don't want to support this union lord I don't want to support this unions politics\nLet me give Romney a chance to jump in particularly in regards to the the impact at all this has had on collective bargaining particularly in states that have enacted right to work legislation cell\nFrom the Doris do charitable foundation whos clinical scientists development towards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health and from the listeners to support this NPR station\nBefore we get back to today's installment of our series the state we're in a quick worried about tomorrow's conversation will be discussing lotteries be honest did you\n... will be discussing lotteries be honest did you buy a ticket the mega millions jackpot is estimated to now be worth one point six billion dollars\nOne point six billion have you ever won a lottery if you have we'd love to know what made you buy a ticket and how winning affected you\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to

send us a radio quality audio files through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories if you're lucky tomorrow on one day back\nNow to our conversation with Scott Greenberger Randi Weingarten and Vincent for a new show before we keep going Scott there was a statistic you shared earlier that I think he wanted to clarify just to make sure we got it right yeah I just wanted to\nClarify that according to federal statistics are more than a third of public school teacher as police officers firefighters are and and other government workers where union members um as of two thousand seven\nSo naturally at those jobs were covered by unions are in your membership gotcha grant thank you very much clarify that Randy you wanted to react to counties voice mail from Ohio Go ahead\nGreat and my apologies if I uh I'd heard stuff that I take you over her\nAt all or given it is you [laughter]\nUm so well ... you know I Know we live in a world where you know truth and fact no longer seem to matter but let me just throw out\nFact no longer seem to matter but let me just throw out a couple of things what kind of was saying is that in the privates the privatization in Ohio lead to less safety and bus drivers and or in bus um transport\nThe privatization insurers led to it's a huge issue in the Ohio governor's race right now because this\nVirtual charter called E. caught meaning um a charter that said it was I'm serving Twenty one thousand kids fleece the taxpayers of Ohio by somewhere between a hundred million to a billion dollars and the wind evidently was the attorney general during this period of time and didn't\nTake this issue seriously and Cordray is making it a big issue and people are really upset about it\nI think that what happens is that union sometimes look we we become the voices people\nAnd people on the other side don't like it sometimes like the divorces like the Koch brothers\nBut it is the difference between being stronger together which is what county was saying versus going it alone and and people who are rich can go it alone most of us can't and that's why frankly union membership and my union is up in the last ten years by about two hundred and fifty thousand people because people feel stronger together\nEven when we all kind of debate\nAt our conventions what our policy should be it has to be democratically based and it has to be about the value of what we do for not only are members but for kids\nWe heard from some of our listeners about membership going up in the Jacob emailed I'm an ...\nThere was about membership going up indeed Jacob emailed I'm an ... shop steward with local one twelve and an employee with the state of Maryland post Janice we've seen very few members opt out and in fact we appear to be seeing more interest in our union\nRandy I Wonder if we could back up to something that Vincent ... said earlier up a point that he made in terms of being required to pay versus\nHaving the desire to pay you know I you know I worked as the host of this program and this was not work that I Would do for free\nBut the the plurality of the work that I Do is funded by the public deciding that one a as something they want the W. A. M. uses station they care about and so they choose to give and so the barometer we have\nOf whether we're doing what people want is their willingness to become members to become sustaining members to give to write us into their wells to donate their cars to be you know cashed out to to support the station\nIt feels like a similar argument with folks and right to work states where they say if unions are doing what they are members want them to do you don't have to compel them to pay their dues they will pay gladly because they'll know that what they're getting from the union they can't get on their own it's absolutely essential what's wrong with that argument\nSo Josh what it's frankly the arguments and the point that Janice case has ... has decided\nThat you know everything is completely voluntary the argument used today this that if you are creating a staff and I'm an entity that is a bargaining contracts and representing all of everyone that it shouldn't just be that people with a ...\nEveryone then it shouldn't just be the people with the loudest voices\nThey get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention and that just like in terms of taxes to the United states of America or to\n'em or or bar association fees or student loans see or student organization fees\nThat when you have an obligation to serve all that all pay a fair share and that was the argument that actually had a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in the booth case\nAbout forty five years ago and six successive Supreme Court rulings that affirmed it it'd be the case the gym is overturned exactly so but look Janice\nAlito Sam Alito judge of the Supreme Court has wanted this case has asked for this case for years most people thought it was it a a logically base because the issue was really on the outside that that the the case that the Mackinac center I Wish they were being more honest about it\nThat the Mackinac center that Donald Trump that others made was that you know the Democratic party used unions as their foot soldiers so let's defund unions that had really nothing to do with other kinds of things and therefore they want us to a defined us however the cases done\nAnd what has happened since\nIs that members have stuck with unions and and and and and Vincent said something else which I think was or Scott there which I think I just want to raise which is that the Mackinac center\nActually violated all sorts of school board policy and all sorts of norms and was by the day after the genocide case sending an email on school email to work\nTo the Janis ... sending an email on school email to ... to virtually every single teacher in ten states if we had done that\nPeople would be slapping us around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside of school and what we've tried to do is basically say to to the states just give us some time so we can introduce people to the union\nOkay let me give a ... a chance to respond and then we'll keep moving by the way it is worth knowing that the Mackinac center did file a friend of the court brief in the uh Janice versus asked me case but go ahead Vin let me give you a chance to respond\nWell hey thank you and you know there's groups across the country that are communicating with public employees to tell them about their rights mackinaw has their my pay my said dot com website\nI'm In Ohio to go back to your previous caller there's the workers choose dot org website\nAnd these efforts are needed because unions like Randy's are trying to trap public employees into paying them or trying to limit the time that they can exercise their rights under jazz um in some cases in credibly confusing time periods\nOr in some cases only about a week also that\nUm states like New York New Jersey California give unions the ability to essentially have captive audience meetings or make their sales pitch to a public employees while at the same time forbidding anybody else from talking to that our employees and this is during the work\nDay we clerk clerk or what you mean by a captive audience meanings what what exactly are you referring to [noise] um well\nLegislation passed in several states gives unions the ability to do what they call a orientation sessions with a with new employees\nTo do what they call a orientation sessions with a with new employees so basically think it's time share presentation on steroids where the union can come and say this is why you have to join put a dues check off for a more a membership form in front of them say you have to you know here's why you really shouldn't side up\nAnd there is no one else saying well wait a minute you know you actually have the right not to so that's why you're seeing all these efforts these educational efforts around the country saying no to know your rights and by the way if there is a artificial time period to limit\nWhen you can exercise your rights I'm this is what it is and Sears help navigating that often confusing process and that process that's making fusing on purpose to keep public employees trapped\nI Want to move on from his lead to to see if we can move on and and go a little bit further forward in terms of what the future legislative landscape for this\nMay be I Will say that I have done union covered worked in the state of California before and I never went through anything that felt like a time share presentation I think people's mileage Scott will vary depending on what that on voting meeting is like\nWell a somewhat when I mentioned uh New York some other states I think this is what I'm referring to hear a New Jersey Marilyn washed in California some blue pro union states have\nThey say is eighty eight point seven and nine to one point seven K.

X. dot com or from an agent Hitchcock's insurance encourage courage\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson we're speaking to can aid when former U.S ambassador to the un and the author of Reagan at Reykjavik let's get to a few more of your questions about this treaty before we move on to speaking with General Stanley McChrystal quite a few people ask questions\nLike what Catherine asked on our website the one eight dot org Catherine rights is this an actual treaty if it is wouldn't that be Congress's territory not Trump's\nAnd Andrew tweeted is two thirds of the Senate required to withdraw from the treaty\nWhose are good questions uh and uh it's unclear in the constitution would Congress' role would be in getting out of a treaty yes this is a treaty yes it was ...\nAnd getting out of a treaty yes this is a treaty yes it was ratified by the Senate uh and uh in Nineteen eighty seven actually in Nineteen eighty eight who signed by Gorbachev and Reagan in the White House with Trump president in Nineteen eighty seven or ... but\nIt has been established over the years that to get out of the treaty or is the president's discretion in Congress has no role in that\nCan you put this into a little bit more context for us I mean I I think it's hard at least for me as someone who only sees nuclear proliferation from the outside\nTo know where in my mind to hold all these different potential threats there's the threat from Russia there is a threat from North Korea there's a potential of a threat from China who knows what all terror organizations might be trying to ... closer to a nuclear weapon\nIn the scheme of things we or should we put this treaty in in our minds like in the hierarchy of the various nuclear threats that the world faces where is where does is it\nIt's it's pretty high I'll tell you why because it's restrained by the United states and Russia against a whole class of nuclear weapons okay\nTo me the highest in your uh pantheon of nuclear uh treaties and nuclear threats are that are bound by treaties is the nonproliferation treaty which really discourages countries from the spread of nuclear weapons okay we don't want the nuclear weapons to spread\nAnd are buying large that's been pretty successful Joshua or the fact is in Nineteen sixty three President Kennedy gave a speech in which he says\nSixty three President Kennedy gave a speech in which he said by Nineteen Seventy there would be twenty five nuclear weapon states\nBy Nineteen Seventy okay today they're about six seven\nAnd so we've done a lot better than people expected and that gets back to Parkinson's ah to me the best law that the success of a policy is measured Best Buy those disasters that do not ensue\nAnd the ... the liberation of nuclear weapons was a disaster that did not and so and so that was pretty successful\nIt also seems like just the fact that a treaty could be reached between parties was was a victory I mean you know in a while he says they're a little tense right now\nRight it was and certainly the weekend in Reykjavik in October eleventh and twelfth Nineteen eighty six that document in my book and thank you for mentioning it\nOr that it will be turned into a movie fairly soon a is an exciting rollercoaster of up and down and emotions up as a up and down views in what's thought to be a haunted house in Iceland that produce the treaty that we're talking about today it was a real taffy tug\nOf for the whole weekend we spent from eight o'clock at night\n'til six thirty the next morning\nGoing over the details of this and I could report to the president the next morning on that type of job or twelfth Nineteen eighty six we have accomplished more last night in one night than we have in seven years of constant negotiations with the Russians it was just a whale of a weekend\nBefore we move on and we'll be speaking to stay\nWe'll avoid weekend before we move on and we'll be speaking to stay in General Stanley McChrystal at a moment about his new book on leadership and I wonder if by way of wrapping up our conversation that I could ask you about the leaders who signed this treaty Ronald Reagan and Rick how Gorbachev here is President Reagan at that meeting in Nineteen eighty seven\nThe importance of this treaty transcends numbers we have listened to the wisdom of in an old Russian maxim and I'm sure you're familiar with it too\nMuch Mr general secretary though my pronunciation may give you difficulty the maximum is do vi no pro vi trust but verify [noise]\nVeggie ... answer to this city is you end up ... you were the fat at every meeting [noise] from the meeting\nIn Nineteen eighty seven between Ronald Reagan and be called Gorbachev give us a sense of the leadership styles of Reagan and Gorbachev that allow this treaty to come to fruition\nWell when you think of Ronald Reagan or you think of a man who is extremely decent and a conservative Republican incompetent he was just a very competent person or when you think of ... a\nGorbachev he was a communist uh but overall a decent person who wanted to do something at that time they were both very different from the president we have now Joshua or in the sense that um\nYou know when I was in government uh mothers and fathers wanted their kids to grow up like Ronald Reagan maybe not the policies maybe they didn't agree with the policies but the decency the man\nMaybe they didn't get rid of the policies but the decency of the man\nThe humbled and is the man the genuine niceness of him and today even if you're agreeing with Trump's policies which I don't but even if you do I don't think any mother father wants their kid to grow up to be like a Donald Trump or this\nIs the winner probably sorry are probably some who see an opening quality and the president or they're hard\nTo say though there will disguise Joshua\nAnd uh the decency the kindness of Reagan who really loved immigrants and his office was decorated with pictures of immigrants his farewell address to the country talked about the wonders of wonderful immigrants coming to our country and his whole address was about immigration how wonderful it was\nHe was a fanatic about a free trade or not having terrorists at any time and he was very intense ... reduce government spending and reduce especially the deficit all those things were\nClassic conservative classic\nRepublican and um none of them are being followed by this so called Republican\nI'm Donald Trump but anyway the style of Reagan was a style that made somebody like me very proud to serve him and very proud to be there with him on that weekend and record back in Ninety six\n... author of Reagan Reykjavik forty eight hours that ended the Cold War also the arms control director for President Reagan and former U.S ambassador to the UN ambassador ... thanks for talking to us okay now learn how to spell Reykjavik are extra wide [noise] I'll work on it I think very much a very good bye\nWhat two Confederate General Robert e and the Reverend Dr Martin Luther king junior have in common\nAccording to retired General Stanley McChrystal they are both leaders worth studying granted we study them for a very different reasons but they did some of the same things\nThey made bold decisions that won them loyal following the controversial within the very leadership structures that brought them into power and they are revered today for what they represent it not just what they accomplished\nStill these men with several things in common which seemed to have almost nothing in common\nPerhaps that's the paradox of leadership\nThere is no one formula no one checklist that defines all leaders\nStanley McChrystal retired as a four star general he served as the top us commander in Afghanistan

A. M. U. dot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage I ... I recall some people using the word leader and some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted\nIf a quote unquote leader fails to leave but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear are they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in rules and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said or effective or not because\nYou can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler if we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous\nWe think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders the dad retired from the military I had never met\nThe day I retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then a short conversation he just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way he made me feel better\nI think we want our leaders to make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubbed your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who's a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent\nWho pushes you to be better than you would otherwise be that military commander who works you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way but at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot\nBut typically they give alongside to us and and if we we frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say are we demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask when so many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through them one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textual right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors and the leader can use them and on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization\nThey can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context has changed the followers are in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team and the situation\nThe second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them we use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe it what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and I thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy because I was there and I would therefore be the star\nBut when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome and therefore thought I should get credit or blame for that but I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that have played upon that\nWhen I concluded with the leaders still part of it I mean I was still like keep part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on a leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are but all the other things in the situation\nOr putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the leader of caused the great thing to happen or is ultimately responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nI Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the silly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven dwarves so he kind of you kind of wanted it that way which\n... so he kind of you kind of wanted it that way\nIt's very common I mean if you think about it everybody a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she\nDid an extraordinary job pushing his team to grade at a masterpiece he wanted the basket and that and it was a natural problem but it cost him a huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWe're speaking to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York the co author of leaders miss and reality that third myth you call the results myth which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter\nWill results matter and we claim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality\nThe data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures or their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in a certain emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results than we think we are\nMarjorie emailed good leaders know how to train the next leaders and went to release the training wheels and step down I'm interested in March ... comments she's reflects something that a John Maxwell describes in the five levels of leadership basically\nUh John Maxwell describes and the five levels of leadership basically the fifth level to the top two levels are about replicating yourself in other people but I Wonder where you see that a lot of the leaders that you profile weren't necessarily looking to replicate themselves and others\nIt it it is something you don't see often it up Martin Luther king Junior's probably a success story there when he was murdered in Nineteen sixty eight the movement went on headed suddenly stopped in his loss than I think it would have said something\nOn the other hand if you look at Margaret Thatcher she was a very successful female politician in Britain in a tough time for a female politician she became the most famous prime minister

U. dot org\nAnthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from that\nSide that are acquaintance ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and now in times past than I always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say to threaten to run yeah threatened to run yeah LA's higher than a run for president are are going to support Romney is ...\nThe run for president are are going to support Romney because you know I decided it's not the right time for me to run for president so there's only a little short of about the word threatened not flown the ideal or he hinted at a rally threatened yeah that's a go go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party\nIt was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president but sort of like that sort of a threat but ah\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person has a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature of the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of this story and then it makes it harder for your a bottle you know so for me um I Love coming on NPR all go on the left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews\nBecause I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said that he spent a lot of time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side in that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way\nIf I got to the other side and weaken my argument that I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from them well and there's something to the the\nAgree with but I like hearing from them well and there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press is a communications director where you tried\nTo convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you've said that\nIt it pushes back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive I hear you on that but the president\nDidn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nYeah no no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know like if you if you if you read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in the air\nWas to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so having the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power and that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department I might ... plan is a online somewhere somebody lead did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press and servicing all parts of the press so it didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything I only did one press conference\nBeing a only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call and CNN had been called on for several weeks and I want to send a message to those people that have we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business\nAnd you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I build my own business and you know came from scratch so I went in the square on that though I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted to previous ban and out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly and the job\nIt was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president\nAnd even if I accepted a subordinate role which I would've been happy to do is I'm a team player I don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality\nOr does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly would like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ... having you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for him to find out even beyond that and even beyond that\nBut as far as like me any more than he likes the president but your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press\nHe could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean\nI get the sense that the president just didn't agree with that [noise] um no\nActually ... is a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I've been announces ... over a Tim in Iowa\nWhere I've been announces ... directors over a timid I Alone in the office I'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and says hey it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI live in a while you declared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media for ... going to lose that war secondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well we're way better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president is a TV star or people may not like me saying that about him\nBut for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism let him parity with Leslie stall let him have a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice in so I was arguing for that I think we had them in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people that don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president's or there's a lot of people inside the ... like okay we\nGot to protect the president from him telling these like mala props and him telling these stories that on average ... may be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm used to seeing inaccurately and and clearly in consistently over ... ...\nItaly and and clearly in consistently over ... listen I just left a morning show where these guys like they they really want them all day and night and so and they were calling him a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energize and I understand that and I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want all that stuff to be dial down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to\nSo so but but we had to do then is you got to tell him straight if a man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he'll say back to you as well it's energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nOr and and this is always going to be as ... as long as Donald J Trump is the president United States is going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and the people that don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way there are some people were the personality is actually outweighing the policy where they're like okay look I Can't take the personality even though the policies are good ...\nLet me get through a few more comments I Know we've only got you for a few more minutes but let me get to

down and she was or not to\nTie and all that they [laughter] you know that I Will\nSay that he I ate it I'm not going to lie and say that it was a complete cars for my family and when I say my family\nWe'll say that you know it it\nI'm not going to lie and say that it was a complete cars for my family and when I say my family I'm going to talk about my husband and my\nTwo daughters so in so many ways it was a blessing because our parents did share a small portion with my\nBrother and I you know that means that my kids can literally choose any primary and secondary education gold I won't they go to any school for any amount of time they can do anything they want if you want to travel to Italy to study architecture because that your dream\nDo it you know and that's an absolute blast that my husband and I both being and solve for sales we would have been able to afford that any way but it's nice to have that cushion right [noise]\nUm [noise] so there are blessings but I Will say that women has shown me personally the absolute\nDark side of human nature and you know it wasn't my women but I have absolutely experienced it I'm sure my parents you know would have many many more storage I'm In\n... in speaking about my parents it's strained relationship you know I've chosen to become extremely private about this women you know my husband and I moved to a different town to just kind of get away [noise] because my\nParents one and a state where do you cannot remain anonymous ever them that with habits because they love to brag about it they love to spend lavishly like it like look at me where I'm more of the exact opposite and some of that is just out of fear either I'm I'm\nKind of fear based anyway do you worry about the people that are going to kidnap your kids for ransom I worry about my parents someone hitting them over the head which making sure everyone stays home and\nI'm In Oregon annoyed and then we got to move on in in just a moment but I Wonder how you reflect back on that if you could go back to whatever the story was where your parents bought that winning ticket and see something to them before they bought it ... what would you say\nIt would be the same thing that I Would tell anyone who won tonight\nThem before they bought it ... what would you say\nIt would be the same thing that I Would tell anyone who won tonight or if you won two million dollars if one two billion dollars that doesn't matter I think it\nIt's they absolutely need to have the typical advice that you hear you know surround yourself with a great taint a CPA a financial advisor at attorney but my biggest vice would be to be careful\nThese are not necessarily the people that you went to high school with the office is in a strip mall are handled your last or or whatever\nYou know you've had you know the scale of your\nNew state has to match their ability to serve you and you know if you can't remain anonymous consider options that allows you to remain as anonymous as\nAs possible and then you control the message out you know I I Know that there are ways to do it and I think the last one is to just be aware of people's actions no matter how subtle
