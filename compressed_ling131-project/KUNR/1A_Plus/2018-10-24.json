A. M. U. dot org\nAnthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from that\nOh this either that or acquaintance ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and now in times past than I always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say to threaten to run yeah threatened to run yeah LA's higher than a run for president are are going to support Romney 'cause you know I decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little night Jordan of about the word threatened not he floated the idea or he\nThreatened not he floated the idea or he hinted at a rally threatened\nYeah that's a go go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know if you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president was sort of like that sort of a threat but ah\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person as a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your a bottle you know so for me um I Love coming on NPR all go on left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews\nBecause I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said that he spent a lotta time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side and that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way\nIf I got to the other side and it weakened my argument that I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from\nWell and there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press as the communications director where you tried to convince the president to to dial down some of the rent\nI had to convince the president to to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that\nIt pushed back is normal but this kind of ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive I\nHear you on that but the president didn't seem to be having it he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy\nAgenda yeah no no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know like if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there\nWas to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so having the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody we did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press and servicing all parts of the press who didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything\nI only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call on CNN they had been called on for several weeks and I want to send a message to those people that have we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room\nOpen for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business\nOr and you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I build my own business and you know came from scratch so I went in the square on it though I mean do you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted to previous ban and out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly in the job\nIt was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president\nAnd even if I accepted a subordinate role which I Would have been happy to do is I'm a team player I don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality\nOr does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly would like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ... having you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for him to even be on the on the list\nBut as a matter of fact I was going to like me any more than he likes to present your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press\nHe could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean\nI get the sense that the president just didn't agree with it [noise] um no\nActually ... you know ... is a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I've been announces ... over a timid I Alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and says hey it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's going so poorly in the first six months I listen to what you declare war\nPoorly in the first six months I Lived in a while you declared war on the media and you can't declare war on the media first of all you're gonna lose that war\nSecondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well wait better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president is a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him\nBut for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism let 'em parity with allegedly stall let him have a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had him in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people don't like the president's are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president's or there's a lot of people inside the common theme of like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like ... and him telling these up\nA story said only that average ... maybe a generous word for some of the things that I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm On saying inaccurately and and clearly in consistently oh was it was and I just left they show where these guys like but they\nThey really want them all day and night and so and they're calling them a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get every\nDoing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that\nAnd I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want all that stuff to be dialed down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to\nSo so but but we have to do that as you got to tell him straight you say man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but will he'll say back is well it's energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nOr and and this is always going to be as ... as long as Donald J Trump is the president United States it's going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people don't like his policy are going to take his personality and if you don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way there are some people were the personality is actually outweighing the policy where they're like okay look I Can't take the personality even though the policies are good and\nDavid is in a diner Minnesota David emailed thanks for taking the time to answer questions on NPR my question is\nHave you ever in your personal experiences with Trump's seen him do something for the public good out of ethical or moral reasons instead of doing it because of legal reasons are wanting to maintain an image or exchange favors if you can can we hear about it Anthony yeah\nI don't really I haven't really seen any of that so I don't I don't like being one of those

wealth once the money gone into your parents' hands how did they handle it [noise]\nAnd that's a great question and I'm I'm going to agree with him I'm not gonna lie everything that you know even if I say something negative about the wind today I Am not going to lie on such a hypocrite yes we have a ticket for tonight's drawing\nHuh one billion\nRising no wait a minute wait a minute you already one

and all that they are but I Will\nSay that\nI'm not going to lie and say that it was a complete cars for my family and when I say my family I'm going to talk about my husband and my\nTwo daughters so in so many ways it was a blessing because our parents didn't share small portion with my brother and I you know that means that my kids can literally cheese any primary and secondary education gold I won't go to any school for any amount of time\nShe use any primary and secondary education gold I won't they go to any school for any amount of time they can do anything they want if you want to travel to Italy to study architecture because that your dream\nDo it you know and that's an absolute blast that my husband and I both being and solve for sales we would have been able to afford that any way but it's nice to have that cushion right um [noise] so there are blessings but I Will say that women has shown me personally the absolute\nDark side of human nature and you know it wasn't my women but I have absolutely experienced it I'm sure my parents you know would have many many more stories um and you're in speaking about my parents it's strained relationship you know I've chosen to become\nExtremely private about this women you know my husband and I moved to a different town to just kind of get away\n[noise] because my parents one and a state where you cannot remain anonymous

stays home and\nI'm going to know I mean we got to move on in in just a moment but I Wonder how you reflect back on that if you could go back to whatever the story was where your parents bought the winning ticket and see something to them before they bought it ... what would you say\nIt would be the same thing that I Would tell\nAnyone who won tonight or if you won two million dollars if you won

A. M. U. dot org\nBarbara emailed I still talk weekly by phone to Yemeni friends in Sana'a and solder the are living in hell and they ask\nWhy does America hate us so much why does America wants to kill us\nWhat do I say\nSomeone before we continue in before we bring in our next voices on the conversation I Wonder if you could just for those people who haven't been following the Yemeni civil war very clearly can you just boil down at the core of it what does this conflict about who are the fighters and what are they fighting for\nSo Yemen's conflict is actually quite complex conflict\nA it's a it's a conflict that has many layers to it but ultimately what you hear in the news is that's a it's a Saudi Iranian proxy war you also hear that the government at the who the government in Sana'a that announced itself is actually in fact a a coup government that is run by a militia\nAnd that the Saudi Government is trying to restore the legitimate Yemeni government ah to power in Yemen\nNow the problem with all of that as this conflict is\nFailing to do all of the things that they're saying it's a it's about for example\nWhen Saudi Arabia got involved in this conflict with the Arab coalition the aim is to bring back the Yemeni government the Yemeni government has been residing in jail since the war started and a struggling to go back to places where there is no who's the militia on the ground\nWhere there is no who's the bullish on the ground\nAnd on top of that the who the militia in a sense has gained so much more since the war started in the sense that at first they had to share power with uh the former president of Yemen where you know in two thousand eleven Yemen had a revolution and I'm the president was removed\nBut he ... himself with the ... and was president for some time but uh the sheer power with him now fast forward three years into the war they had killed them and and now they have their own control of the majority of the north of Yemen\nAnd of course the the scariest thing about this is that the Houthi militia had managed to capture the Yemeni military arsenal that belong to the former government is now all in their hand and so in a sense what the war dead is complicate an already complicated political situation\nAnd it devastated the lives of millions of the enemies\nOf for example Seventy five percent of the Yemeni population is is suffering and in need of immediate aid and depend on foreign aid to kind of survive and this is a Seventy percent increase since before the war began um\nAnd I didn't want to talk more about the the population on the ground that needs help I just want to move before we were next words is also didn't want to be clear there was a sectarian part of this to these\nThese who the rebels who kind of came after the government you're Saudi Arabia involving itself but there is the Muslim sectarian aspect to this also is Sunni versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot\nRight so this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of the people don't realize first of all the Shiite and Yemen are don't practice the same sect of ... that Iran practices or the Shiites in Lebanon are at all to practice\nThey practice a sect called the DSM and ... and is known as five or ... and it's really different from twelve or show which is a the ... he formed that's practice in Iran\nWhat's interesting is that it's the closest form of ... that resembles so many of them are and in Yemen we the Sunnis there are ... and the divide isn't you know the the ... are not a minority like in other places or forty five percent of the population\nAnd so what's interesting about this you know Sunni Shia conflict is that it's entirely manufactured in a sense that of course there are differences between these those two sects of course there are\nSituations where they don't agree but they managed to co exist for many years\nNow the CDs or the who the sect of of you know what's happening in Yemen they're no longer practicing as they do use them as it is it seems like they're trying to politicize say DSM into kind of a associate themselves more with the Iranian sect of she has ... and ...\nHas struggled to maintain it sucked as it is with the influence of well how does them and set up as him coming into the country and so in a sense what you're seeing is that the most radical elements of those two\nAre fighting each other and so in a sense you have the presence of a new ... conflict but one thing that I have two points out to the listeners here is that that's not the only thing going on um\nHere is that that's not the only thing going on\nI'm a huge portion of the country in the liberated territory from the control is actually demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south so ever since Nineteen Ninety four the people their fault that they were under occupation and the cost secession\nAre rising day after day as this conflict continues\nI'd want to make sure we get to a voice on the ground in Yemen but I hear what you're saying someone in terms of all of these very complex fault lines they've kind of come together to fuel the civil war today now before we came on the air today\nWe were able to get through to Sana'a in Yemen all communication into and out of Yemen is really tough but we did make contact with least grounding she's the UN's resident and humanitarian\nCoordinator for Yemen least laid out what the conditions are like right now for those who are living and working there here as part of our conversation that we take just a few minutes ago we've gone to welcome to want to\nThank you very much\nCan you give me a sense just in a in a larger context how many people the un fears are at risk of famine right now\nIn game and we are worried that steps are not taken right now\nIn order to stop the spread of hunger that we could see as many as four ... who are facing famine by the end of the year\nThis is why the United nations is rain the alarm bells and telling everyone that we are facing possibly the biggest famine in living memory if we don't it was something to stop it right now\nAre some of the other health risks that you're looking at their other than just starvation I'm sure with deprivation of a reasonable\nStarvation I'm sure with deprivation of a reasonable secure supply of food all kinds of other health problems also come into play right\nThat's exactly right last year the largest cholera outbreak in modern history hit name and there were more than a million people who are suffering either from Colorado or from watery diarrhea there had never been an outbreak of such magnitude in living memory\nNow this year because of the heroic work that's being done by frontline partners in UN agencies and officials here in game and we've been able to contain the spread of how the Democrats have similar levels there is a lot of color in the country but it's not spreading at the rate of was last year\nThat being said when people exist for months and months on supplemental rations when they are eating limited amounts of food what happens over a period of time is that they slowly start\nAnd this is absolutely but we are saying for millions of people in this country their immune systems are weakening and that makes some highly vulnerable to infections and water borne diseases including cholera\nAnd just by way of contacts leaves mentioned that there are fourteen million people that the un fears are at risk of famine the population of Illinois where we are right now doing this program it from Chicago is Thirteen million people just by way of context\nLeast give me a sense of what a mother a father a parent has to do in Yemen right now to try and feed their child continue boils down to what an individual might be dealing with just to try to feed themselves and feed their family would they have to do\n[noise] sixty percent of all of the people who live in this country are what we call food insecure now out of that out of those Eighteen million people every single morning there are eight and a half million who wake up and they have absolutely no idea where they are getting\nPeople every single morning there were eight and a half million to wake up and they have absolutely no idea where they are going to get food from that day\nSo what will happen is a family will use absolutely every means at their disposal to secure what they can they'll go to their relatives and bake\nTechnique for breast cancer learn

through Facebook our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nBefore we continue some al Hamdani let me come back to you for a second I checked in with our audience here at W. B. easy in Chicago to kind of ask them if they were tracking with us and one of the things that I think confuses a lot of people it confuses me too\nIs the nature of this secretary in aspect\nLike several of us and we have a at a rate\nLike several of us and we have a memory of of age range of your students and seniors and everybody in between have heard of Sunni and Shia Muslims\nBut then that like the the sects within the sects I think that's where a lot of it's kind of get lost can you\nCan you bottom line that for us what difference does it make what some of these people are with like why why does the sects why does the sex involved matter to this can you just kind of simplified force\nSo when it comes to Yemen like I mentioned uh the majority of the northern part of Yemen is historically say D and the majority of the southern portions of Yemen as historically shaft eye and say these can be called Shia and the chef ... they're called ...\nNow the ... conflict\nA kind of began years ago and then was revived recently\nUm what we see as the political importation\nOf religious sects of what we're seeing it play is political Islam and that's what you're hearing about you know the chefs in a conflict it's not really a religious matter today it's really a political matter of allegiance to what part of the middle east are you going to support and what we're seeing play out is that\nIran is announcing itself as the um [noise]\nKind of the guardian of ... and Saudi Arabia on the other hand is presenting itself to the world is the ...\nAnd so as soon as she our is pretty much kind of people fighting for the interests of who's going to take control in the region\nFighting for the interests of who's going to take control in the region\nAnd that's what this what's happening in Yemen you know for instance when this war started\nWe know that the u._s. then under the administration of President Obama had struck a deal of um nuclear deal with Iran and the sense they sacrifice dam and by saying here you can fight Iran in Yemen but the U.S is gonna kind of find this deal with Iran\nNow that was a short sighted move because I think a lot of people that didn't anticipate that today President Trump would come to power and then today you have and a nuclear deal with Iran\nAnd at the same time also had this devastating crisis in Yemen and so in a sense\nOkay so let me let me ... I think so let me let me back up and try and repeat back to you what you just said I said I've been drawn a diagram everybody here ... has been watching you scribble in my piece of paper\nSo we've got these these two sets of Islam Sunni Islam and Shia Islam it's this old centuries old fight that has been made\nPolitical you use the phrase political Islam to describe\nHow we run is kind of for political and regional power reasons trying to kind of claim itself as the the defender of the Shia Muslim face\nAnd Saudi Arabia has kind of ... anointed itself the defender of the Sunni Muslim faith and that politicized Islam has spread into other conflicts and Yemen these factions in Yemen\nIran and Saudi Arabia are supporting these factions is kind of a battle in this larger war for the soul of political Islam is that kind of it\nSure yeah exactly and so what I'm saying\nIslam is that kind of it sure yeah exactly and so what I'm saying is that historically and traditionally the sect of Islam that ... have practiced for years are not necessarily aligned with the Saudi an Iranian sets up for political reasons they are now aligning with each other gotcha\nGotcha folks here it'd be easy does that make more sense good we got some up all around and if you go and I I appreciate you explain that I think\nYou know part of the complication Jane Ferguson is that this is complicated I mean some wars you can't just\nBoil down to one cause but that also makes it hard\nFor us sworn in Yemen to zero in on them and and really think our teeth in but your reporting has involved some of the people on the ground\nWho are dealing with the results of this larger fight for the soul of political Islam you described the story of an eleven year old girl that you encountered back in June but kind of stuck with you can you give us the basics of what happened to her\n... telling her story is one of the reason is the most important reason why journalists need access to this because we have to put\nA face and a name and a picture to the statistics otherwise they're just the tin steaks and I think than we we deal with with a lot\nOf that of of of difficulty trying to get the public to understand the level of this crisis so I and I was in ... um which is a product and sort of in northwest of of Santa and controlled by the who the rebels\nAnd uh and it's meant and us in the in the town of hijacking the capital of the province there was a hospital where like every single hospital that I've seen ... ... the children's ward is now a de facto malnutrition ward and we were just filming there with some\nThe children's ward is now a de facto malnutrition wards and we were just filming there with some women and their babies' whenever a young man tall deathly thin\nRushed in with a with a tiny what looked like just sort of like a bundle of clothes and it was his eleven year old sister name was ... and for a horrible few moments we really thought may mono might dying\nIn front of us on the hospital bed she was eleven years old and waived I think twenty four pounds was what it was about what we had to what we had asked that the doctors at that and it was\nAbsolutely a horrifying to watch her she you know when when a child gets so weak and so among nourished\nThey also become so vulnerable to any kinds of infection and so they tend to get a diarrhea anyway and so even even if you do manage to get through to them and uh they get diarrhea they get devastatingly dehydrated as a result the whole thing just spirals\nUntil the child's body just gives in um we spent some time they're filming with my own and speaking with her family and her mother eventually came the next day we were able to talk to her and we were piecing together the family's story and it is a story that reflects millions of\nPeople's stories in Yemen and it is that her father was a schoolteacher and a government school but whenever the\nUh the government salaries stopped over two years ago\nHe his salary stopped to once people lost that level of income the government was that the the biggest employer by far in the country before the war\nAnd that's not just soldiers and police that's people who work in offices that's teachers any kind of clerical work or any kind of bureaucratic work in Yemen\nWants those salaries stopped people would then go on to trying to live off of what the agencies would coal coping mechanisms to you and I that's simply do have any savings do I have a line of credit at the local store do have any livestock\nDo I have any savings do I have a line of credit at the local store do have any livestock in the backyard do I have relatives who can help us out after two years\nThose coping strategies run out and they ran an ad for this family and they simply had no money and once a child starts to go downhill it can spiral out of control like this\nThey were lucky family because they were able to afford to pay a cab\nTo take them to the town I'm ... and lots of families are not that lucky and so one of the things that is really important to remember by this crisis is we don't even know how many children are dying fresh or we don't know how many don't make it to the hospitals and uh and you know this one child came from a middle class family an educated father\nOn your smartphone\nEqual access to education is the law but racial issues can get in the way

M. you dont born before we bring in our next two guests Steve I didn't want to ask you one thing about the wave the documentary was made I Wonder how you said about\nTelling the students' stories I mean there is a moment in one episode where either you or a cameraman and tries to talk about one student about her cutting class I mean all the kids that you follow goes through various struggles with\nIts class was grades with life what kinds of boundaries do you have to sense when you're telling a story about high schoolers\nYou have to set when you're telling a story about high schoolers\nWell that's a great question um I've always tried in the films I've done over the years is to a\n... have the subject feel like they have real agency in the making of what we're doing\nA you know the idea we aim for is is that we're really making the film with them not on them and yes ultimately we have editorial control but we take very seriously that kind of relationship and on this series it was vitally important\nThat they're also be other filmmakers involved we had a diverse team of filmmakers Kevin shower Rebecca parish being Lou\n... Charles the story was followed by Kevin Shaw I mean I felt a little bit with Charles but that's really cabin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry being that that followed a Charles a story\nAnd they had to establish these kinds of relationships\nUm that are important now the moment you're talking about is with tiara that's actually a story I happened to be falling and you know if you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with her because she was struggling with a lot of things at that time as always relevant to include that in the film\nA few more of your comments before we bring in our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we failed to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period and the sentence\nAgility for fun tweeted I've watched every episode of America to me I absolutely love it I'm shocked at how clueless the white teachers are especially that physics teacher the school board is a disaster spoken word\nSchool board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the news for full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Steve associate for his thoughts on the series we did not get a response but that invitation remains open we also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school Nathan rouse\nWe were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit\nFor courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary either is that right see that's right\nWhat's that seem more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmended Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy\nAt the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called despite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to what I think that any also with us here at W. B. easy as David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is a Chicago native professor Stovall welcome they so much that have professors have you watched the series any part of it some of it all of that yes\nProfessor stove or what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest\nThing that struck me the hardest as an episode to win one of the parents of student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the empty conversation that we do not have about schools that have the illusion of integration and I said the illusion of integration because\nHave the illusion of integration and I said the illusion of integration because it just means that students of color are in the same place with white students\nWhen this mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he still happening today that to me the story of us ... professor Lewis what about you [noise]\nYou know one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in the series but I think one of the things that all the struck me as the silences some of the some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate and who wasn't\nOne of the things you notice in that district is that the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families a key leaders and the district a lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like\nA opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on in the district\nBy the way for those of you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you're eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so do that in mind in the conversation if you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them tweets do not\nTweeting me [laughter] 'cause I ruin this film for you I don't want to air it was if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety at the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org\nWe're talking about racial\nEquity professor still vote what does that mean what does racial equity look like is it and making sure that black kids in\nHe looked like is it and making sure that black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people feel being nice to one another like how would we know racial equity if we had it\nRight I mean I think the Susan thank you for that question I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to him and his point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution\nSo when you talk about redistribution so now the question becomes who has had the least and now what are those things that they talk about that they meet the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they need it and I think is ... is the issue and concern\nGive me an example of getting people what they need one they need\nIt for a young person says we have a particular problem with this teacher who is constantly giving us disciplinary referrals\nConstantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious now there needs to be so that racial equity team at the schoolhouse whoever that is\nThat person needs to be in the conversation or that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people most often happens in school houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition professor Lewis ... what\nDo you find that the big barriers to advancing tore racial equity is it is it funding is that the people involved is it different for every school in every district what tends to get in the ...\nWell I'm going to talk about the parks in the world and there are a lot of them and I think one of the things that um my colleague John Diamond and I found when we were doing the research for our buck was that when you really kind of\nReally trying to understand why changes so hard it really is especially in these kind of communities\nAbout the folks who have a lot of resources that have been served well by those districts for a long time not wanting change to happen and we talk about this is a kind of form of opportunity hoarding\nBut it's a way of trying to decide how race works today differently than it worked in the past in the past we might have said you can't be in my class or we're going to have separate schools all this kind of things today we had this have been near of racial integration and we what we do instead is create these racially segregated academic

foundation\nBefore we get back to our conversation here in Chicago are worried about what we'll be talking about in Atlanta tomorrow\nPoison it appears to be Russia's preferred weapon of choice and we'll find out who Moscow was targeting and why\nWe like to know what questions you want answered so leave us a voice mail eight five five to three fix one a one a America's relationship with Russia and what was the Soviet Union has had its fair share of ups and downs but\nWhat message do you think Washington should be sending to Moscow now\nEight five five to three six one a one a I'd say five five to three six one two one two will dig deeper into the files of ... and get to some of your questions tomorrow from Atlanta on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors Amanda Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one a tax club how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall one person wrote the white adults\nThank you for the mall one person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother text club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to wrap myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet\nI suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like advanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way\nCan push too far that we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make\nMe I I mean it's not in a a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue and not pushing far enough\nRight when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity and then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one why student did not get one scholarship does not mean that\nBlack and Latino students across the country do not are not typically denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the\nThat becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve that's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you haven't been able to par south reactions that that finally\nWell I I'm not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdotal experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it it has been a good experience more eye opening experience if for no other reason and there are other reasons is is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not\nLiving in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some of my past work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white parents\nCharles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for anyone high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin does that reflect your experience and all of my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general like there's kind of\nI think in general like there's kind of like\nHow do I say there's this blanket we put over white kids it's like you're you know they always going to be warm regardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color there's like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of sleeping bags but we ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get that sleep in ... you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who's also feature documentary where like\nI wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to compare saying the other students but the school has like\nI guess prominent interest in us because of what we do with our extracurricular is and so it was just already saying that they're like okay well we need to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who is in in any extra curricular lose who doesn't have any type of\nUm non student teacher relationship with any adult in the building they like it's hard to get it you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there is this link is vices sleeping bags whereas like\nAll other white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have stakes in the school the parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever and then you got the kids who I mean like meat luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to oh the but other than that right it was not really too kind\nOther than that right it was not really so you kind of have to fend for yourself exactly and we like it does is not the case you know I think it it goes to show and um which episodes that we must have been doing it was like\nMost of the kids and his our news um tutoring sessions are usually white and all widely so yeah oh I Know that's that's part like you know\nPersonal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to get on his tutoring but I was just the one right the you know so\nWell to that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years\nYou know it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you could take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like Evanston like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens of these kinds of districts\nThat tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts we take hits that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in\nAnd we tracked them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kids are in a higher tax get more they get better they can better teaching and so we take his it might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time\nAnd so when we look at schools like a park as Dave said earlier\nThe structures that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks um are inevitably going to uh take racial disparities\nTo uh take racial disparities that exist in our society and and reproduce them in our schools and that this channel the troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how these tracks get credit and if you look at the history of the really deep racist history of tracking and general\nRace also becomes explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational spaces in school or Ninety percent white and the least advantage educational expect you know there are places in the same exact school ... black\nShould have us all up in arms about the fact that we think that that's okay it's all about our racial mythology\nI I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and bought a good education is and you know I've heard a PE teachers including Ty Williams the black or a teacher in the series lament the fact that as a piece students often just want to be\nGiven the information they need to score well on the test that's what they want they're not really that interested in learning\nBut just the it's a game it's in supporting\nGame I mean in terms of a larger kind of a ... as an editor for vacation like having a more well read learned ...\nSome of the some of the most interesting and I think for far reaching in deep teaching was going on at lower levels which is not to excuse the system that amount is talking about but we just to read the fine being educated in such narrow ways it's about ACT scores and GPA's and the you know and that's what we defined as being an educated person\nI I hear you on that Steve but at the same time you know I think about I'm not trying to excuse because sooner no I I hear that I I I I hear that though I ... I Wonder though professor still while I think about you know kids who grow up in in rough or parts of town", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "24"}
