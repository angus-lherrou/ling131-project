in the studio with me Rebecca Traister writer at large for New York magazine and author of good and bad\nEmailed to say I am so tired of people equating my anger with the insanity\nFriends laugh at my

allegations I'm angry at the assumption that all American women or antique having a pro choice liberal and progressive I'm a proud American woman who is also a conservative pro life pro Cavanaugh\nI Am an American woman to\nNow Rebecca Traister you started to paint a picture of the history of women who got an angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me\nUs and Britain you Cooper you've written a book about finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme in how the story fits into the moment [noise]\nA shore so part of what happens is that women are told 'em as many of your listeners say that to be angry it's to be irrational\nUm and I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me um and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture because my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wakeup call for me as someone who had run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life\nBecause I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institutions\nAnd so my student who was a young black woman saw and be a kind of authenticity and she helped me to realize that\nMy anger wasn't keeping me from doing my job or showing up are offering quality lectures are material or material but then it was actually\nHelping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging other women to make which is ... knowledge that we have the right to our rage and some reject ideas that say that when we're angry about legitimate injustices\nThat this in some way makes us irrational or makes our claims illegitimate and when we then begin to own that anger doesn't mean that we would come destructive or harmful it means that we happen to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to see\n'em and more women needs to give themselves permission to do that\nI've given myself permission to do that I'm at in this moment I Am on the front lines of saying to women outrage have the potential if we own it and if we don't apologize for us to change this very scary a trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about\nA we have a lot to be angry about uh but that anger is the catalyst for us to be able to do something about the things we see\nNow let's move from the sun\nAble to do something about the things we see now let's move from the Senate committee hearing room\nAnd the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are esteemed authors have Britain onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment that American shared within the last couple of weeks\nSerena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U.S open here's a cut I'll bring you back there to refresher memory of anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n[noise]\n... shared this moment along with the rest of America us arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who found that anger or weaponized against her\nUh yes I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany in Tribeca and I have been talking about it was interesting because\nThere are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she she was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the u._s. open I Believe\nAnd so in that moment there were two very distinct response as if the responses of the people that really just wanted to see her in isolation acting on it and this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within that much\nThe way in which Ramos treated Serena\nWas that there was a broader context to her anger not only did he accuse her of cheating but this also came out on the heels of reports that members of the u._s. TA had been showing up to her house\nUnannounced and testing her over and over again on grounds that maybe she was doping even though she has come clean on every drug tested even those statistics show that they were testing her double the amount that they were testing any other players on the women's five and so she had been subjected to repeated indignities\nAnd then as the best tennis player of her generation and perhaps ever see them has a referee\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Americans for the arts committed to transforming America's communities through the arts in arts

Johnson we're talking about the power of women's anger in the current moment in America\nI'm Talking with Rebecca Traister for New York magazine and the cut author of good and bad Britney Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage and also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book\nRage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment of Hillary Clinton into twenty sixteen campaign and I want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for navigating the shoulders of how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton has a history of being\nVery careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America and in fact it was news in the two thousand and eight campaign I remember this when she shed a cheap\nNews in the two thousand ... campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle and a half so now a lotta people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was tone police listen\nI regret deeply\nHow angry\nTone of the campaign became [noise]\nNot\nYour fault says one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately in that in Hillary fashion says I regret how nasty the campaign became I'm surprised I'm only does this moment has clearly struck a chord with Rebecca Traister who's laughing here in the studio with me but how does that strike you [laughter]\nSo she was off as she was she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting\nOn it I mean I think it was um\nIt was ridiculous that this woman was called an authentic while being held to the standard\nOf careful control in her voice and her facial the parents and her body\nAnd her motive expression I mean the two candidates um that were her primary opponents about Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they can pound ...\nYou know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was the gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend meant\nOften are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender um and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord ... is so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton\nBoth Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political press for their particular skill in channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift they were able to give voice to this frustration and we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet\nEvery time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ... a a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough sad smile is if it was like some cat color on the street smile more\nUm she was told that regularly\nAnd I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in our own memoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her\nAnd how menacing and aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but that she was thinking no no no\nSame get away from me but then she was thinking no no no that's going to redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad it's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story told us about how much energy\nWomen expand modulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective\nAnd and I think that that's something that that all three of us who are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expressions\nI Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last sort of section of the show that we have about where some of this anger\nGoes because this is a moment in America and let's be realistic moments have a way of feeding they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nMaybe the cameras in all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Brittany Cooper are not as interested anymore you know in in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many wanting listeners I Want to play you another match up with some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling\nMy name's Aaron I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is Sarah from Cincinnati when I met my anger bubble over and I get really angry out loud it it really doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as\nBeing angry are overreacting women yelling even in this day and age that very acceptable men don't have that same problem and I'm\nStarting to feel like maybe it's not just a personal issue I'm dealing with what's going to be nice\nAll men don't seem to have that same problem and I'm\nStarting to feel like maybe it's not just the personal issue I'm dealing with the company nice and and uh and keep my mouth shut however I Am so angry and so angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm trying my anger into action Kevin help but feel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging\nI think that's what when that happens you know we have to take that anger hold onto it\nAnd that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from listeners women who it feels like there's a theme there are transferring\nSome of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action industry is taking action maybe at the ballot box we got this tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville I'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office\nI'm running for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on my determination to be a voice for all and focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracy is one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation a Brittany Cooper I Want to talk about where\nThis goes in terms of maybe the midterms that might be the most immediate effect I'm a\nNone of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any\nPollster or political analyst worth anything is looking down and what they call the cross tabs and noticing\nA that women are mad women are going to vote and women are going to form a tidal wave in twenty Eighteen one way or the other\nAbsolutely and that is as it should be um I'm particularly heartened by the Stacey Abrams campaign down in Georgia we have the opportunity to have the first black woman governor of a state of a former slave state of the practically campaign they're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing\nSlave state um the ... campaign they're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing we've been seeing that since twenty sixteen we had a wave of\nA progressive as sort of radically progressive black mayors in the deep south um and so one of the things that I Want to challenge folks to do as we think in this moment is to actually look at what people of color are doing not just women but we're particularly black women in these elections the ways that we have the channeling our\nAnger on for decades and decades and that started with the way that we voted for Hillary Clinton in this most immediate political moment um but to your earlier point about whether or not\nOur anger can be sustained um I think that I think that this can be sustained I think that we have to remember that the women's movement in this country do it goes through ebbs and flows has really been a solid political project uh since uh depending on how you count eighty thirty one or Eighteen forty eight\nSo we're we're two hundred years in a almost here and so I think you know I'm I think that there is a real opportunity for us to make some change here and I think the women see that\nUm our power in our ability to frame issues in ways that include the most Americans and take care of the most marginalized Americans um I I'm I'm excited about a blue wave\nFrom the University of Nevada Reno this de da point seven in Ninety One point seven K.

submitted the results of its limited investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh the report came in late last night we're told hours after that Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell filed a motion\nFor a friday vote on Brett Kavanaugh's Kavanaugh's nomination on the Senate floor the final vote on whether to confirm him is expected to happen Saturday joining me to discuss the report and its potential fallout is NPR Justice Department a reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan welcome\nThank you so we have this report or will the Senate has the report now or do we the people had any idea what is actually contained within the four corners well\nWe don't have any sort of specific snow and this is certainly something that is confidential and not a something that is generally released to the public and there are no plans at this point according to the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley for any of this to be made public a despite clearly a\nA fair amount of interest among Democrats to make this public and certainly I think among the Trump a chunk of the American public to to learn what's in there\nOf what we do know is that publicly at least a six people have confirmed that they spoke to the FBI many of them are people who are friends of judge Kavanaugh's during high school that would be mark judge PJ Smith Tim God that and Chris Garrett\nOr as well as one friend of of Ford's that's legal in Kaiser who all confirmed that they spoke to the FBI and then there's a second woman who made allegations of sexual misconduct against cabin on that's Deborah Ramirez and we know that she also spoke to the FBI\nNow a NPR has learned um that\nAlso spoke to the FBI now a NPR has learned um that uh nine people according to a to a an official nine people spoke with the the FBI in total um but again a lot of this is one that you know we don't know what all\nThe FBI was told in this uh and likely we're not going to get a full picture but what we do have so far as what a chairman Grassley has said and that is that there's nothing in there that the committee and the public at this point\nDidn't already know so where is the report right now physically I mean how our senators looking at it because it's extremely sensitive every reporter in Washington wants to get a look at it and and every political operative does too\nWell or the process for this is governed by a memorandum of understanding that uh dates back\nRound a decade uh but what generally happens is when the White House gets this background an information on a judicial nominees nominee that will send it over to a Senate Judiciary committee as generally held in the Judiciary Committee safe\nToday it's being held in a secure location in the capital and which senators can come down and look at it there are the space is basically working in shifts right now we're Democrats will get now are\nUm to take a look at it and then Republicans and there are small handful of a staffers who have clearance

percent all of that is backdrop to Brazil upcoming presidential elections far right populist ... he's facing off against the leftist his rival Fernando had died on Sunday and the lead up to the election has already been packed with drama including balls in our owes near fatal stabbing last month\nAnd we're here to talk about what the election means for Brazil and how what happens in Brazil will reverberate across both America's\nMonica to bowl is he or she is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics she's also director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins university\nAnd she she's here with me in the studio Monica thanks for being here thank you for having me Brian winter is editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the counsel of the Americas he joined us over Skype from Sao paulo in Brazil Brian thanks for being here\nHello Todd happy to be with you good to talk to you and power ... is director of their Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center he's also with us here in Studio ... thanks to you for being here pleasure to be a well Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you honors here to start\nA let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him as ... as a\nRetired army captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades now I'm ... despite having sat in Congress\nFirst so much time he he shows open loading for ah for the legislative body I mean he has said over the years numerous times that the Congress as the dysfunction\nOpen loading for ah for the legislative body I mean he has said over the years numerous times that the Congress has the dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists and\nAnd other political opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure but\nIn the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd those messages um are resonating a lot\nMore with people when they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has a ten point lead in polls over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth\nAnd that one is that one's a close call right now between him and and the guy who's likely to face\nWith this Fernando had died\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty ten to twenty Fifteen and this seemed like\nJust such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last military rule from Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen eighty five\nBut being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our all even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people suggest bumps world uh Brian we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit uh we'll we'll get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast he's not as\nFiery as ... in our with correspondent who's been described by some as Trump being or maybe more akin to ... in the Philippines likes to Wade guns around said drug dealers should be shot or threatened to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent for ... for ah\nFernando ... what do we know about him\nHis opponent for for of Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him um is that he's not a an organic member of the Workers Party the P. T. um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the ... the far left so\nHe's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three um two twenty ten when the party really did take this sort of center left stance so the party itself now is very much hard left um the candidate though isn't\nUm that being said the the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both so narrow\nUm is this anti PT vote so these elections are very strange because they have become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not see a friend\nWe're going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we are going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're gonna talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nThree voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do come out to the polls of what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think there are more weary than a decisive in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally uh eighty percent of the voters show up or we may have less of a proportion this time or\nOne important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank were cancelled oval because that is important whoever gets a fifty percent of the salad votes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nOr we both are not when they more like the according to the late ... is that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood ... and with people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil or\nRegardless if they are the less from the left from the riot or from the center people feel absolutely fed up with politics with politicians\nAnd that there is no alternative because there is not going to be admitted there equal in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics now\nBrian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm both an R. O. has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waving machine guns around as I mentioned he\nRhetoric he's been photographed waiting machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or for drug dealers receives being shot but there's been some actual violence in this campaign last month ... was actually stabbed at a campaign rally\nOr what happened there and what's happened since how has it affected his standing among voters in Brazil in a way I mean\nIf it was adding all of us were paying to see a political violence at that level and I was personally awful for for both so narrow he he almost\nDied by his own account and and those are the doctors that treated him\nPolitically I think it's fair to say that it was helpful um because\nThe plan by the more centrist candidates in this race was to spend these last couple of weeks attacking both scenario as much as possible and on TV ads and elsewhere and and because of this attack against him and because of the resulting\nPublic sympathy they really had to tone down or in some cases eliminate totally their attacks it's also allowed ... to stay fairly quiet and not articulate his plans what he would do if he gets elected as much as he otherwise would have had to I mean he either is a huge\nDuring here and now all of a new one on K you in our public radio\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with a legacy of putting clients financial well being first learned more Raymond James dot\nCom [noise] and from bona with a\nBona certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractors committed to expertise and customer service contract or low cater and more information\nOr at bona dot com [noise]\nBack to ... we're talking about the political climate in Brazil heading up to this weekend's presidential election what's happening in Brazil might seem familiar to Americans in the wake of the twenty sixteen us presidential elections my guests are Monica doubles\nSixteen us presidential elections\nMy guests are Monica ... senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics Brian winter is the editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the council the ... of the Americas\nAnd Paolo ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and you had been sending us your message is one of the listeners\nDrew emails I was in northwest Brazil last month staying with a gay black friend he is all in for ... people are so fed up after the carwash scandal\nThey will go for anything that isn't part of the Workers Party now Monica before the break you were telling us about car wash the actual car wash in the broad offensive corruption scandal\nOr is it over ... have have all of the [noise] I don't want to mix metaphors but have all the will have all the cars been overturned and opened up and cleaned out in car wash\nWell it is winding down um so the bulk of it has already has already occurred but let me go back in time just a little bit because it is important to put into context you think\nThe most important I'm finding that have love as yet though or of car wash worrying twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen\nAnd at that time I'm president Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party was Brazil's leader she had been reelected in twenty fourteen into was president at the time\nUm she was impeached in twenty six team and part of the reason for her impeachment there are many moving parts here but one of the moving parts was the fact that a she had lost control of hook of her coalition and her her coalition\nAll of her of her coalition and her her coalition had um a number of other political parties that war implicated in the car wash\nFindings in the car wash probing the plea bargains 'em and everything else that started to come out publicly in terms of this particular investigation\nShe was she ... she never did anything to actually stop the investigation which was really a positive thing\nUm but that was one of the things that actually lead to her downfall because\nThe the impeachment that she suffered\nWas really very much politically motivated by the need that some of these political parties in her coalition had to try to at least slow ... if not stop it all together and this is a very important element when we look at the degree of polarization that currently exists in Brazil\nBecause the people who still defend the workers' party instill defend the P. T.\nThey go back to the impeachment of Rousseff as one major argument for why you know things that the the workers' party has been let's say\nUnfairly treated and the way that the that that things have gone down\nMet writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country the greatest country that never was meaning to Brazil has had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states\nApollo ... makes a good point Brazil was celebrated as the rising star not only of Latin America of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned\nEmerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top are now horrible recession horrible corruption what happened in Brazil where was the Brazil that debt hosted the Olympics in was and was on the way up\nWell I think Brazil believe too much in its magic that it's a country predestined can be great and forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build that country or one of the major be trails is precisely the workers' party a party that was led\nBy a man born into poverty or that or a build this very successful party on initially ethics in politics\nThere is this sense after Brazil\nA ... a basic ... riding a wonderful wave in international economics meat producer of commodities had the wonderful moment Barbara too was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well\nA than reality hit\nA ruler made a very bad choice and his successor a and a a\nLot of a shot to came and the magic would disappear or what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what that she'll be positive and all of this we cannot blame others for our problems\nThis crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians are and another thing that is potentially positive\nIs the fact that the states in Brazil was basically broke\nAnd we have run off the money\nIn Brazil he's basically broke and we have run off the money or all that dream now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be called from that from a ... reality ... basis where the government has run all the money we have to adjust the economy\nThe measures necessary to do that are very\nOff an unpopular and none of the candidates have explain exactly what the how they plan to go from the ...\nNow Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Brian date you recently wrote\nWhere you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite not enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that terse conclusion well\nIf you look around right now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be an inspiring um the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program\nI feel like they're voting against somebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences of that is is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned tied\nThe degree of cynicism the degree of disbelief that people have in our system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen\nThis happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world but this democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating\nUm in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its politicians because of this\nBill is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its\nPoliticians because of this corruption\nScandal than virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the Pew Research center and twenty Seventeen that\nFound that just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest I'm thirty eight countries that that that you surveyed\n... and that just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both denaro if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a you know hard right turn that could involve the curtail moment of civil civil liberties and and and other things\nI I in my time I'm this week um I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile I guess just blew me away I mean it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back to previous\nPeriods of military rule Nineteen sixty four\nWas the last two I thought that that was a real Brazil that had been firmly relegated to the history books and\nYou know maybe maybe maybe they are maybe it is getting a little\nBit melodramatic in some quarters but but they're real fears and and and people are scared right now\nWill Brian you mentioned a statistic that was disturbing only eight percent of Brazilian say their representative democracy\nIs the best form of government now I'm an right to the point ... emails us why are we so concerned about the right versus the left in Brazil\n... is another ... he's an air to wanna ... all these dictator dictator wannabes who were being resurrected in Europe and Asia and now in Latin America all of them are low for their corruption their narcissism and a total lack\nOf democracy and Paolo in ...\nThe system and a total lack of democracy and Paolo in the United states it's been said more than once that a ... is a Brazilian version a Brazilian analog of\nPresident Donald Trump

political tribalism well here is one well remembered moment from the nineties I take you back to president almost president at this point Bill Clinton\nYou answer that question is a member of who say well when I was in England I experimented with no ... and I didn't like it that didn't inhale and they're trying to do\nBill Clinton in the run up to the presidential elections in Nineteen Ninety two or the deceased late Christopher Hitchens went to Oxford with Bill Clinton said the idea that Bill Clinton didn't inhale at Oxford was probably true because he knew first hand that Bill Clinton chose to take his marijuana in edible foreign\nThat's what Hitchens used to say he was no friend of Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that a Bill Clinton's answer was\nHe was no friend of Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that\nA Bill Clinton's answer was lampooned at the time it's still remember now\nTwenty six years later what political moments do you remember from the Nineteen nineties we want to hear from you what do they tell us about our politics today you can comment on our Facebook page you can tweet us ... when a you can email us one a at W. A. M. U. dot org we heard from Susan who sent us an email I Believe that our political risk\nStarted well before the Nineteen nineties the Vietnam Conflict was one of the most visited issues\nSince the civil war and we still have never recovered\nAnd not witty tweets us on Twitter I was in high school when Gingrich and company produced their contract with America I remember peers who had been pleasant with each other suddenly became antagonistic suddenly politics became a team sport that experience is one of the reasons why I today and non partisan\nA Steve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting\nMight sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do I want to get to a moment in tribalism in politics\nWhere we are right now I Want to talk about Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham back during impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment manager he helped impeach Bill Clinton and then ... before the Senate to make the case as a prosecutor\nThat Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the brick Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended cab and he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody saw it I'm a single white male people want me to shut up\nAnd I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with Lindsey\nLee White men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve hears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner in twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years you've been the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart\nYou know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are dead\nMen walking as far as [noise]\nNow back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quip Timmy and any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as a Republican Party in the future meaning Republicans had to broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics\nFlash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore stunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hocus vacation in the Trump here it said to you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I think\nTells me that the divide is deepening and you know did tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand election they say that we've lived with sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after twenty twelve election there was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally look to the Mitt Romney's last a Brock Obama and concluded what you know what Lindsey Graham did demographically the way the country had been divided up for\nLindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term they came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election and that's a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party is like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with their voters it told and boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand granted air than granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator from one more term or is he is he converted what's he think I mean look there's and there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but to give you a couple of them that that that that jumped out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons to Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk if you are seen as\nAs you are taking a major major risk if you are seen as separating yourself from this president your next primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being a being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also the theory that hey part of this is\nLindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises uh if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you go off with him maybe\nIf you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons to is it is again Lindsey Graham looking at Trump and twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think tells Lindsey Graham and just ... more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacture them fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's changed his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me\nThat I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and in Steve you're not him because that does not sound surprising to you yeah well what he's describing his ticket splitting the main political science they the voters who go\nWhat he's describing his ticket splitting yeah at the main political science they the voters who go and they a Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and in that that is just the rise of polarization his rival is All right let's get\nBack in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve corner you so much of what your book is about uh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have a when he was a young rabble rousing congressmen\nWho was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then time speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nI find the speaker is you as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of this house\nIf you are saying to me the urine postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run\nThen I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into the post office\nNow maybe a veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give us the backstory and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at uh the well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill\nThere there in in hindsight now you look back Thirty years new player you may say well what was the big deal to deal with Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years\nThey were seen as the permanent majority I mean Republicans weren't just the minority party they were buried deep they weren't even close you didn't go into an election saying maybe the Republicans will get it maybe they won't it was like maybe they'll get to a

for you\nThe top Republican on the Senate Judiciary committee says the FBI has turned up nothing to corroborate allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was involved in sexual assault in high school and another instance of sexual misconduct in college there is nothing in it that we didn't already know said Senator Chuck Grassley adding\nThere's also no contemporaneous evidence\nThis

Grassley chairman of the Judiciary Committee I was quoting their\nRanking member on the Senate Judiciary committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California disagrees she says it looks to be the product

to three six one two one two will make sure to get your stories on the air part of the national conversation in the days ahead here on one a\nWhile we're talking for the most part about what politician said and did in the Nineteen Ninety so how did they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington this polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right\nIn many ways we are a shining city on it but the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in the city's splendor and glory there is this fair Mr President and the faces that you don't see in the places that you don't visit\nAnd you're a shining city\nBelieve you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe\nCuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from ... the early nineties I take you back towards any whole [noise]\nSoon\nTo be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety two on the Arsenio Hall show remember him for ... before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because the president appeared on our city hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nWas also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second third place in the presidential race at that point versus Ross Perot [laughter] taking place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton in so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two\nHad was thought to be unelectable he'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam drafted going through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of slick willy the guy who's going to you know ...\nThat sort of hard in this image of slick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer early try this scheme is way out of\nOut of everything and so they were trying his campaign was\nTo to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hot at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd it was Ninety two it wasn't just are sending Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot\nWho was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began in February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Larry King and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was out in February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show\n'em in in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show that night well we won't be doing anything like that and Arsenio Hall went on his show the next night and just tore into\nLike that and Arsenio Hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that when we went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not that's not for a president ... and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is\nSaid and by the end of the campaign to Bush wasn't do in our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm\nPoliticians now managed media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama had\nA winning personality an affable nice guy and used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon just even cold there there isn't a show the ... Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than than maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public have\nChanged just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or sending our home\nAnd I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nIn the rise of Gingrich net moment with Oh Neal what that moment came from was Gingrich looking for a way around at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN give CSPAN was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that in ...\nGo find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich was able to build his career his rise in the house around that fast forward to Donald Trump Donald Trump to\nTelevision obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter Donald Trump identified through Twitter a way to go around\nNot just the news media but the entertainment media is well it's it's so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties was CSPAN and Trump was doing with Twitter\nAnd and I think there's a real common thread there what let's go back\nThen in the way way back machine one more time to Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential run long before he was ever successful he went on meet the press\nBack in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about Pat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party\nFor his ... I guess he's an anti Semite he doesn't like the black sea doesn't like the gays I I it's just incredible that\nAnybody can embrace this guy and maybe I'll get four or five percent of the vote and there'll be a really staunch right wacko vote I'm not even sure if it's right it's just a lack of them and I just can't imagine that anybody can take him seriously\nDonald Trump sounded then about Pat Buchanan how John McCain sounded about Donald Trump", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "04"}
