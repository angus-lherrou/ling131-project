committee to protect journalists the group's deputy director Rob ... he joined us from New York\nRobert let's start with this matter of ... ... can you take us through what we know has happened and what's been alleged to have happened\nWell what we know this happened is that he left London and went to assemble to get paperwork from the Saudi consulate\nTo show that he had been divorced so that he could marry his Turkish fiance he he walked to the ... with her she waited outside he gave her his cell phone because she caught the cell phones into diplomatic missions\nAnd she waited eleven hours and he never came out\nThe whole area is surrounded with security cameras and there's no footage of him ever leaving the consummate that's what we know what we have since heard is Turkish

legislative trends at the state level\nNext month in the midterms four states have ballot initiatives that would change how they draw voting districts instead of lawmakers drawing their own lines independent redistricting commissions would take over Twenty one states already have these commissions\nSupporters say independent commissions helped make districts more competitive critics say it's too much power to give an elected officials\nJoining us to discuss it is read Wilson national correspondent for the hill read welcome back to want to say\nHey Joshua also with us is David daily a senior fellow at fair votes a nonprofit focused on electoral reform David is also the author of an upcoming book about redistricting called the rising David welcome\nThanks for having event and joining us from WG VU public radio in Grand Rapids Michigan is Katie ... she's the founder and executive director of voters not politicians which is based in Grand Rapids Haiti thanks for joining us\nGlad to be a Katie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting or form I Want to hear what you're up to\nIn Michigan working on redistricting reform I Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you if you were just explain what we mean when we talk about\nRedistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the descending you'll senses\nThe census really starts the whole process of the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of uh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get\nIs a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know there are four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington hill method some California gets the fifty first date and if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well uh but then that does\nThe seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAh and that's how we figure out that ah say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state so this happens every ten years and then\nEvery ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways uh some legislatures have challenged\nThat in different ways of some legislatures have challenged uh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power or other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various quirks here and there\nAre and uh the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty or the the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and in the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows\nPretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate in crazy ways in ways that\nAre where the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own\nHiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we are going to see thrown around a lot of in this next redistricting cycling\nYeah North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David of what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing these district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it I think there's an awful\nAnd the efforts to reform it I think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states as a Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sundays similar number of members of Congress of both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington\nA Democrats have only been successful in flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb state and the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swing states\nYou also see this is as well at the state legislative level so you have all of these states that are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that\nDemocrats may often when more votes state wide for it chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority\nIn in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override the actions of a democratic governor here at makes politics more extreme it insulate members from voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom bill\nAnd do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the other politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation I'm ... and it also discourages competition in a lot of these states in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went\nWithout a major party competitor so voters had no choice and almost half of their districts here because folks took a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nGoing to get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience as hot as hot as topics including with Michael wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power they shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballot to fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election ain't that a load of crap\nThat's also the same in North Carolina law by the way we did a program a while back in February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online we have some gerrymandered districts and we wanted to see if you could tell the difference between the map of gerrymandered district and an ink blot\nThe map of gerrymandered district\nAnd an ink blot on a Rorschach test\nYou can find that quiz if you search the words gerrymandering G. E. R. R. Y. M. A. N. B. E. R. I. N. G. it was a program that aired this February you'll find that on our website the one a dot org\n... let me come to you talk about voters not politicians I understand that this was a redistricting initiative that got started after you were trying to find some way to be politically active but not overtly hyper partisan and this is something that galvanized people around you right\nYeah um I accidentally started a political movement with a Facebook post it was after that twenty sixteen election uh before\nI'm headed to a Thanksgiving dinner and I had heard my friends and family really uh being drawn to both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders a with these messages about draining the swamp and the political revolution and\nI realized that you know there's a lot of frustration against the current system in place which makes a lot of sense I remember learning about gerrymandering and it does make it to that our voices aren't heard or that popular or proposals aren't being passed that the local level\nAnd we're lucky in Michigan where we have the citizen lead ballot initiative process which means if we can write constitutional language as the people in Michigan and then gather a this last around three hundred and Fifteen thousand six hundred and fifty four registered Michigan voters signatures\nThen we can have the people in the general election vote 'em ... directly on a

tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Katie face he's the founder and executive director of voters not politicians David daily senior fellow at fair vote and the author of the upcoming book the rising and read Wilson national correspondent\nFor the hill a couple of you wrote us to respond to lower his message about Pennsylvania's redrawn maps not being in place for this year's election\nMark writes that the new Pennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle Steve writes the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get us fair districts somewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures look at the old seventh congressional district\nThankfully the new districts are enforced for twenty Eighteen in some of them say that the seventh congressional district in Pennsylvania looks like goofy and Donald Duck facing one another seriously just Google it speaking of which Maurice tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion world\nHe sent us a link to a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com\nThis is a saying gerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of voting districts than North Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district's Louisiana six Florida force Michigan fourteenth\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry a hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state and attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states we gotta\nThe Republican controlled states we got a lot of comments read about\nThe role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current maps it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIs that fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantage but what what what do we know\nThe Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and how they were Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates\nBack in twenty Seventeen the waiver Janine elections work the delegates are elected in an odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nA but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which\nIs sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives uh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the there's no party is blameless in this\nUh gerrymandering started we get the word from a ... a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts\nUh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those do exist today\nA is to win all the districts around it or the a newspaper ... in in Boston\nTook a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's\nTook a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander some ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic hum you could argue that some of this happened back in in a female and democracy back in you know the\nFive hundred BC uh but when we talk about today\nYeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south that were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland\nUh there's one district or out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes both parties do this Republicans have done it a more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about\nA fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the winds aren't fair and therefore are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish\nThe fact that that these lines may not be fair but the people who who ... tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nWe do get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the G O P is going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to read history by a nonpartisan commission\nSlow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts in the shape of a pencil\nJoanne wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue\n... wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court with a majority appointed by Republican governors and approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership been killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and see so publicly\n... he I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had with folks are that you've been witness to a folks kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel\nPractically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience really has been that um I mean in Michigan though we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drawn process so maybe that helps but\nWe have volunteers who are Democrats or Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan the really common sense things\nUh that we all look to government at at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know we are also a Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still Republicans do you live in those districts into their voices aren't heard or because a lot of these races are happening in the primaries\nOr because a lot of these races are happening in the primaries and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level of Michigan we're a lot of people talking about even if they're the of fish all that is there um representative of the party they leg they're much more extreme than what they would like to see\nAnd so I think that in Michigan in particular people have just had enough we feel like our government's doing a lot of overreach and want to help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the least trends parents states when it comes to transparency in government\nUm and that's the biggest thing we heard all you're doing those town halls is a lot of people saying you know I don't know why these lines are being drawn\nAnd then eight years later some emails coming out a talking directly about how these lines were drawn to guarantee one party and advantage or another\nAnd people are tired of it they want to be looked at as having our politicians accountable to us and not special interests um what's been really cool to is that you see a lot of families who have joined voters not politicians to volunteer together even for my family did work um after that Thanksgiving\nDinner or not we ... yeah yeah my mom gathered five hundred\nSignatures and is canvassing every day we got thirty days till the election so\nIt's been really exciting I mean you see a

Chicago police officer who was also a whistle blower within the department more undercover with the FBI Shannon\nWho was also a whistle blower with in the department more undercover with the FBI Shannon welcome to the program [noise] thank you Joshua no I understand you had been working as an FBI informant within the department and as a result of what happened that caused\nSome of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you ... what happened that caused such a stern did it have to do with with corruption inside the Chicago police department\n[noise] absolutely Joshua I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were\nActually involved and are running the narcotics trade with and the Chicago area and\nThere for I began\nAnd operation dubbed operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who\nI use the term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed these officers one of them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department because\nBefore I came forward with operation brass tacks the code of silence\nWas unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist\nOr they tried to label man it's crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nI Wonder why that is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer have law enforcement in my family but I've never taken an oath so I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider but I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories\nWe're reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught I Would be grateful to see them go because drugs all of us though why do you think it's not a similar mentality and law enforcement\n[noise] you know honestly a lot of police officers dead approach man they still talk to me and you are correct on us police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence is\nSo strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that officers actually fear what will happen to them if they break this code of silence and\nWhat was interesting to discover during this journey of\nBreaking the code of silence is that there's this common misconception that it's a blue officers blue shirt common St officers going against other officers when actually I learned that the retaliation came from the top down\nBosses were actually\nInstructing the officers who were working with me not to back me up\nOr they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of fear of becoming me out of fear of retaliation themselves or putting their lives in danger of losing their job what could happen to them they complied because they it it's easier it's\nEasier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't want to\nThey felt they had to I had officers come up to me and say you know I Believe in what you're doing but I Can't be seen ... because I'll be next\nWe'll let me let me play a clip from the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police coven ground this what do you have to say after the conviction of officer Jason Van Dyke this clip comes from W.

O. X. P. O. P.\nIn the store and we'll share some of your questions in stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Neal Franklin Shannon Spalding Patrick Smith and judge will Doris Cordell let's get some more of your comments before we start kind of looking forward at where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHey sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard\nWe do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun however Galvin had these questions Galvin writes the question is what is reasonable\nDoes disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force is a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot\nWhile they may be criminals are the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions church Cordell maybe you should respond a Galvin how do we suss out in a fine or sense what reasonable mess is\nOn us is in the eye of the beholder it really has no one definition and what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes of the officer and what was the officers thing and oftentimes incidents happen and you know just to\nCells in the shoes of the officer and what was the officers being experiencing and often times incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one definition of it but but I Do want us to\nGet to something you said Joshua about you know looking ahead I Believe it's time to we imagine policing in America policing in America today is is ... militaristic\nAnd police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color and in low income community that's not how policing started in this country policing started with individuals who lived in the community who knew everyone and they were people who were not seen\nAs an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community and it has dramatically changed we have police departments armed to the teeth\nWith tanks and all kinds\nOf of the equipment that uh are commonly used in the military and I think it's\nTime to to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers to basically\nA patrol and and take care of traffic issues why can't that come from within the humidity why can't individuals' community members somehow the deputy ties to to deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMuslim community ... disagree with you just by way of conflicts or some places we're the lower level of sworn law enforce off or worse one officer does deal with things like parking enforcement in traffic enforcement things that are less likely to require daily for\nSure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic force and and they\nThey do have a command structure and ... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have of police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely\nNow to say let's pull back from this whole image we have of police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely\nI'm not opposed to criminal to criminal justice reform but look what happened we we get body cameras and what what happens well we have officers settled oh don't turn the cameras on oh we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order\nTicket footage out on for example in liquid shooting so ... that the whole lack of transparency policing for example has very little sunshine\nThere's very little sunshine and policing we don't get to know who these officers are their track record their history they're disciplined history it's very very difficult to get that information and state\nI think that dovetails with the comment that one of our listeners left for us Ritchie who lives in Maryland lift list in our inbox\nI talked to police both black and white and uh they seem to have this new look drifting approach to the community I have\nAn experiences where you know we should simply you know would rather have conflict with a with community rather than actually serve it I really think that they should\nKnow take away the guns for the first couple of months but leads to buy the inside of the community without guns make them stand up comedian to force you to have a dialogue with community I think it'd be a lot better uh was serving a community\nWhere did you thanks for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first\nIf we could contrast would read you said with another set of comments that we've gone from some of our listeners like what's scholar Rhodes Scholar writes\nPolice put their lives on the line every day protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality involve people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the ...\nDoubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nNeal what would you say to folks who say that police work is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to get home at\nNight so I Believe it was Reggie that left a message yes um\nYou know that was such a brilliant comment because\nForcing the dialogue see when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving and you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge Cordell said um\nHow it used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors\nWhen something happens they support you when you had those relationships but when you have this occupying force\nWere you know none of the people are very few of the people were the ones that you do know there's conflict on the under ... on the other end of that relationship that's a problem this goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform were the community decides who the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever where the community decides what's important with the community decides you know what\nWe can handle these issues that the ground level\nWe just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBut policing is very political it's political through the unions it's political through the mayors and governors\nVery political political through the unions it's political through the mayors and governors and we'll never get to that place into the community this that and they come together and say we want control over our police departments and this is how we want to do it\nHaving that oversight at the beginning means that you don't need police review boards at the end when something goes horribly wrong\nIs speaking of which we got some ideas from some of you about what could be done with regards to policing in review boards were part of it including on a larger scale\nJamie asked shouldn't there be a national group or board who could provide oversight over individual police departments they could be an objective trusted advisory board who's judgments both sides would trust and accept and to whom and agreed local citizens group could appeal\nPaolo tweeted police forces with their training transformed them from people's defenders into what's going to these photos with this dance to police forces not your friend even if you are a regular law abiding citizen so maybe trainings part of it\nOn the Web at K.

A. M. U. dot org speaking of the world of work there's been some breaking news this morning about a woman who is choosing a new job and has resigned from or current position\nNikki Haley America's ambassador to the United nations announced her resignation this morning\nHe leaves formerly the governor of South Carolina has somewhat international reputation for being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told them\nStation for being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on anything but it's on everything but says there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShe will also be remembered in part for striking back at White House adviser Larry Kudlow who suggested she might have been confused regarding Russian sanctions she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get or if you don't get to infuse\nShe and the president but today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nCan't say enough good things about Jared Nirvana guy Jared is such a\nGenius that no one understands I mean to redo the NAFTA deal to weigh in on what I've done working with him on the middle east peace plan it is so unbelievably well done and an office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the things\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're about our country because they're in um that said ministry and I also just have to say I'm certainly thank you to my family Michael at the same\nAnd um my two little ones I adore them entertain us un you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time\nAnd energy into it um but they have a lot of heart and\nReally wanted to make America proud and so with that I'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good flakes and on for the next ... to come in but now\nI don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was I was governor for six years and we've\nI was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand year ... shooting a school shooting them with a lot and then to come in\nAnd did two years have Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to the south was enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so\nThank you know it's been a\nLong time and I will say\nThis um if are all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can promise you what I'll be doing is campaigning for this one so I look forward to supporting the president and the next election\nBut his Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations speaking just a few minutes ago at the White House announcing that she will be resigning from that post back now with our conversation with ... brown and maybe by way of a transition\nWe should get through an email from Hillary who says I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed the work environment have you noticed a difference\nAt absolutely ... absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune from the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen\nIncreased polarization in our families and our neighborhoods among our friends is at work too and it feels dicey or at work um I think that\nPeople have to be careful and especially when there's power differential Z and it it's I I actually believe it's become a pretty significant source of anxiety at work and home\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of these other dividing line\n'cause everything feels like it\nAny of these other dividing line yeah cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nTo see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to kind of open up\nIf that ... toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just need to be this one person I Need to keep my head down and get to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we started talking about emphasizing and being vulnerable and being open and compassionate and knew that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted or you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love that is going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of less\nI think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I'd never seen anything meaningful or significant come from mouth shut had down\nIn my career\nThat's just not how we make contributions and so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and\nRumble and we use the term rumble because it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability\nOf seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle it's a foundational skills that\nI don't think spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives\nArmor\nSpending half of our adult lives in armor\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high\nAnd we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experiences all of who you are to address the problems\nFrom reading your book and based on the research that fuel to book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a star star is tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something tenders there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really it was actually voided my hypothesis going in so where did you arrive\nYeah it just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at guessing what I'm going to find but not in this case\nSo we asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders that there is a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred fifty sea level global leaders\nThree years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are and these were MBA and NBA students at Wharton catalog Rice University and then\nTons of data evaluation data so I thought when when when it was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need braver leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear\nBut then we went and talked to several dairy leaders and said so you're not afraid very often and they were like what\nI'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long and it was like so that blew my hypothesis a fee\nI'm afraid all day long as I said that blew my hypothesis of fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the\nGreatest barrier to daring leadership is armor it's not the fear\nIt's how we self protect when

lead with regards to armor muddy sold emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually a big part of this book because boundaries are incredibly important um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and so armor is not\nAbout professional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense is it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I might protect feeling good about myself\nOver moving our work forward\nTo the difference between so there's a difference between say armor an image such as kind of self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's it's ...\nIt's on a deeper level now it's on a day but I mean the one of the greatest examples of armor armored leadership versus daring leadership as one form of armor we\nSee a lot and folks is that need to be right that it's that I've got to be the ... and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting it right\nWe got a number of comments from those of you\nGetting it right\nWe got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into work places and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which racial power structures and broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace\nDisproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor ... tweeted\nAs a woman of color an immigrant in an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming that distrust well here's what are the\nBiggest findings I think is that one of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the loss of vulnerability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic incident I mean racism homophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nDoes or does your everyday traumas and it is real that that that that you know the armor that you need to survive those things Israel which is why if leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender is another you know I I think the kind of\nAnita Hill criticisms that happen after the forward testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during a way that we have more data all got you know he was\nYou know but absolutely vulnerability can be used against us um and I think that is a ...\nStill it it can be used against us um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core\nValues and I don't think any of us has worked at a company\nThat doesn't have some kind of mission statement or vision for clarification or posters everywhere thing is is that we're supposed to be and then\nIt's really worth nothing more than the paper on which is printed I work at some companies or I'm going to some companies were the value statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well what what was even start\nYou suggest that we should limit our core values to to just to and there's a long list in the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list and I really struggled to narrow down to my to why only two\nWell here's the thing if you don't operation allies values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat poster\nI mean it really it just really a poster so during the movie point in my head that little will tell you [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] you know and so\nWhat was so you know operation allies values into behaviors\nFewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that had taken the time to say you know what I some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in and so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data\nIs really kind of backing into the data\nThe men and women who had the capacity\nTo be the most courageous could identify their values and they had two to three values and you know I have you know there is a long list in the book like we talked about and there's hardly Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nAltruism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independent self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to it my two Corvette my core values for me are facing courage\nAnd I know there's a core values because it's the place where every other things on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we have a companion work buckets free it's downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational lies and into behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we have our company values and that's actually how we assessed shoot every quarter\nLoose on the values that you were to do with\nLike for example one of our values as take good care taking care of each other or south and the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean you either do it or you don't and so\nIt goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that has a real poor\nI think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that as a real core finding which has courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught it's learning how to rumble with on her ability living into your values which we're talking about right now\nIt's braving trust understanding how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nDo you need to declare these values I mean I I Would be fascinated to know what you are listening right now I think my to core values are because I Know what they are I went to the list for I finally figured out my too but I don't know that anyone would guess what my two were based on who I Am the work I Do like I guess one\nSure can't try sure OK face no\nThere's not one of my two ... but it's incompetent what am I to call was but no I Can't tell such if you are I don't know maybe I should maybe I shouldn't and we're talking about vulnerability Joshua no but I'm the host I don't have to do any I'm just I'm In charge here here we go people there were no no I'll I'll go play okay fine I'll tell you what the\nFreedom\nAnd growth those are my two values\nAnd give me an example of a behavior that supports freedom\nUm\nFor me being out one thing yeah ports freedom I'm being a better listener on this program because if I value the freedom to tell my own story I have to then extend that to you and I can't monopolize this this", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "09"}
