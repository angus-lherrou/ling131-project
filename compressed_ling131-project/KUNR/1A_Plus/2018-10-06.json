Israeli Palestinian conflict ... glad to have you back\nGood to be a gesture America and other western governments hammered Russia's spy network this week\nYesterday the U.S indicted seven military spies with links to an Olympic doping scandal earlier of Dutch authorities said they had foiled a cyberattack\nAgainst the international chemical weapons watchdog let's explain for men working for Russian military intelligence or caught trying to hack the computer network at the headquarters of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons OPEC W. that's the group that was investigating the use of chemical\nOPEC W. that's the group that was investigating the use of chemical weapons in Salzburg England that attack on the four Russian spy and in Syria equipment was found in the trunk of a car there was a wife I intend to hidden under a jacket on the shelf reports suggest the set was working when Dutch security officers disrupted the attack\nDavid Sanger let me start with you what what's going on here well what's going on here is that\nWe're beginning to see that the DNC hack and everything that we've been obsessed with rightly so since the twenty sixteen election was to the Russians just a small slice of how they have used cyber\nAs the main way that they see to disrupt and undermine not only foreign governments\nBut those who would be opponents of Vladimir Putin's or those who are busy investigating other Russian malfeasance so when you go across the indictment and the other day that we got a from the British and from the Dutch\nAh yesterday and and the day before\nWhat it adds up to as as soon as you begin an investigation into Russian malfeasance\nYou should expect Packers from what was formerly known as the G argue the military intelligence unit of the Russian military to be at your doorstep or in the case of the chemical weapons or agency to be in the Marriott Hotel parking lot around all the way\nAnd what they're doing is seeking they get into computer systems disrupt\nSteel e mails under cut the legitimacy of the organization sound familiar exactly what they've been doing in Ukraine what they've done in European elections and what they did here in twenty sixteen\nSo we have a sense of why they would want to go after\nSixteen great so we have a sense of why they would want to go after these specific organizations like the the

New York times with regards to cyber hacking Michael asks\nWith the loss and result in widespread dissemination of the CIA tool kit which allows one to spoof packing from another country how can cyber bread crumbs lead to certainty\nThat another country is actually guilty David what do you think\nWell cyber attribution is something that people are getting a lot better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems\nAh years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern part of the U.S\nBut the fact of the matter is that a combination of forensic evidence a motive\nPast uses similar tools can catch you most of the way most of the time so there are some pretty good ways to go\nSay most of the time so there are some pretty good ways to go do it\nThe bigger question facing many governments is once they found this out and perhaps decide one ounce it as happened in these most recent cases then the political pressures on them so what do you do about it\nThat's why the president signed a new set of executive orders in um in August we haven't seen them they're all classified that\nPushes down into the system or the ability for commanders in the U.S to do cyberattacks back without having presidential sign off till now that's been something that the only only the president authorized the use of nuclear weapons and cyber weapons now\nIt's not entirely clear that only he can authorize the use of cyber weapons in retaliation but you want to make sure you're attribution is pretty good before you strike back you know who to attack\nYeah great my read before we move on\nFrom there first of all that is no small thing that that the U.S military might have the latitude unilaterally to shut down a power grid or turn off a hydroelectric dam through the Internet\nBut beyond that do we have a sense that certain countries certain organizations are getting a better handle on dealing with cyberattacks the world clearly hasn't figured this out\nIs anyone making progress I think about the EU because I hear so much about Internet regulations from there on a consumer level but on a military level is anyone making progress or not that I'm aware of the U.S I think it's still a world leader in\nIn in terms of the bands Internet abilities and and the threats are pretty clear or Russia or China and North Korea or Iran\nA Russia China and North Korea or Iran but\nA ... figuring out or response and how you want to calibrate that response so it doesn't become this open ended escalation and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond a you you're injuring really uncharted territory\nVivian do we get a sense of countries beginning to kind of work together to figure this out to to figure out some kind of international response to cyber attacks or his Russia really got the whole world kind of running with here on\n... the what we've seen in the last couple of days is coordination of um indictments and you know raising this concerns about um sighing and otherwise obviously there's a lot of discussions that are taking place\nWhere countries a western allies trying to coordinate some kind of effort to counter the threat that the that the Russians posed but at the same time again you have so many ah\nRestrictions in so many um uncertainties as to how to approach the cyber world in general and cyber threats and as David said the U.S trying to really formulate some sort of attack plan or something to counter to protect our infrastructure so that we don't have\nUm we're not as vulnerable as we've seen ourselves\nIn the past but obviously you know the U.S is still trying to figure out a way forward I'm having looked at what happened to us and the two thousand sixteen election still we're talking about the fact that we are vulnerable in two thousand Eighteen we could be vulnerable on twenty twenty so we haven't actually tried quite figured out how to protect ourselves get alone\nThe world's kind of coordinating on a global scale to do the same it's it's it's not an easy task\nIt's funny kind of a decentralization of the way that we vote that we are so many different kinds of voting systems might\nThe way that we felt that we have so many different kinds of voting systems might in a way kind of how it helps allied health insulated from ... to the fact that we've got all these different utility company yeah that you know ... but but the key element here is we've done a better job at\nDiscussing internally how we would do counterattacks than we have organizing the world than the sort of digital Geneva Convention of what standards of what's on limits and often it\nLet's shift gears and talk about the Nobel Prize is particularly the Nobel Peace prize the winners were announced this morning Dr Denis ... and ... one for their work combating sexual violence as a weapon of war\nThe announcement from the Nobel Committee said in part quote Dennis ... is to help or who has devoted his life defending these victims not him a rod is the witness who tells the abuses perpetrated against herself and others\nWere rod is an Iraqi woman she was captured and held by the Islamic state escaped captivity after three months and told to her story in a book called the last girl\nDr ... founded a hospital in eastern Congo that's treated thousands of women many of whom are survivors of gang rape ... pretty extraordinary people to be winning the prize especially as we've learned more about how sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war and has for quite some time\nYeah really has to two individuals who seem really deserving to the peace prize has been a lot of had a lot of controversy in recent years very politicized a couple of people who really been thrust into dangerous situations handled it with with incredible courage and Dr ... a bill this hospital\nAnd Dr ... up built this hospital in eastern Congo which is in the middle of nowhere just a very remote region\nTwenty years ago for maternal care they're just as much health care of that was his intent\nBut as the Congolese civil war metastasize um rape became a huge issue a huge problem the various factions un peacekeepers were involved in in rape there\nAnd so he became the voice of rape being used as a weapon of war and so he's been asked this for Twenty years very prominent a voice but still operating in a very ah a dicey region of very deserving winter living\nI can really speak for the case of um ... who I I spend a lot of time in Iraq and two dozen Fifteen sixteen I'm interviewing gives you the women who were released from captivity from ISIS and\nThe impact yeah obviously psychologically um physically or the the the use of sexual assault\nAnd rape as a tool and war is obviously a huge thing but you have to also remember that these women go back to their\nTried to go back home a lot of their family shunned them because of cultural sensitivities to such things and so their lives are essentially up ended by their families a lotta times don't take them back home a lot of these women were impregnated I'm as a result of this and\nHad to really know where to go because they were single mothers which in Iraq is is just\nCompletely a taboo and so I you know it's something that huge raising awareness for this was something really really important and you had a lot of people on the ground in Iraq [noise] trying to educate these families that this is not of no fault of the women that they had no say in the matter but obviously you know changing culture\nThey had no say in the matter but obviously you know changing cultural perceptions that's it's it's an uphill battle and so this woman either play I'm trying to do that and it's a it's it's worth the the know notoriety that she's dating\nLet's shift gears and talk about China vice president Mike Pence spoke yesterday accusing China of trying to sway American public opinion and undermined the Trump Administration\nTo put it bluntly President Trump's leadership is working in China wants a different American president there can be no doubt China is meddling in America's democracy David what is\nVice president Pence mean by meddling what do we know about what China actually\nIs doing well it's it's pretty fascinating because he is appropriating the language of the Russian attacks from on the twenty sixteen election and transferring it over to a different set of activities that\nThe Chinese are are involved in that there's no question that the Chinese have views cyber before in for political purposes but they largely haven't used it here they've used it in Taiwan they've used it\nIn their arguments with Tibet they've used it internally a lot they've used it to some degree in Australia and New Zealand\nBut what he is arguing is that in putting together retaliatory tariffs terrorists that are retaliating for terrorists to the United states put on China\nThey are aiming at states and districts that are key to President Trump and therefore causing pain to workers there and they're saying that that accounts meddling well if that's the case we've done that\nTomorrow with highs near fifty seven sunny on Sunday temps near

now to the round up with Vivian ... and David Sanger let's talk about Iran\nAfter the Trump Administration abandoned the nuclear deal that was negotiated during President Obama's tenure and reimposed sanctions Iran took the U. S. to court the international court of justice to Akron argue that the u._s. actions violated the terms of the Nineteen fifty five treaty of ...\nWell the Trump Administration hit back this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the U.S is ending that treaty\nThis is a decision frankly that his thirty nine years overdue\nIn July around brought in Marilyn's case and the international court of justice alleging violations of the treaty of amity or on six to challenge the United states' decision to seize participation in the Iran nuclear deal and to reimpose the sanctions were lifted as part of that deal\nAround his attempt to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United states to take a waffle actions necessary to protect our national security and Iran is abusing the icy Jay for political and propaganda purposes\nThat was secretary of state Mike Pompeo speaking on Wednesday\nPurposes that was secretary of state Mike Pompeo speaking on Wednesday Vivian salami some have said that ending this treaty is largely symbolic or is that so\nYeah it is an unknown and a lot of ways I think um in general it's more just I'm reinforcing the administration says standing efforts to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and um crackdown on Iran and kind of show that they're not messing around and so\nI'm basically this was just one more step in that process but as far as any real uh changes on the ground it really doesn't do much it's really just our sponsor\nTo on the international court of justice says ruling a that essentially said that sanctions that they re imposing sanctions um we're not fair to Iran\nBring my respect for just a second one is this treaty of amity [noise] uh I'm sure that was a question if the state department I just have this vision of some low level staff are going through the basement looking\nTreaty or am I think it's really um ... I can [laughter] result things through what we've heard about it is the big acronym to Jaycee PO away the Iran nuclear deal but\nWhat is this treaty of amateur well in Nineteen fifty three the U.S helped orchestrate a coup in Iran bringing the shah of Iran back to power\nOr if they were us and Iran were buddy buddy at that time and so two years later it's yeah you brought me back to power shirt treaty of amnesty great and they were indeed good friends from fifty three until the Seventy nine revolution\nOh this is the shah who was deposed in these long road in the Islamic\nRevolution of ... Seventy nine so for thirty nine years uh there has been no enmity between us\nNine years uh there has been no enmity between us and Iran um this again seems very symbolic I'm just a last little relic that somehow didn't get shredded after the the the revolution in Seventy nine\nIt was the last hurrah of Kermit Roosevelt grandson of Theodore Roosevelt CIA operative who almost singlehandedly staged this coup and then they got everybody we put in power to go sign the treaty port Kermit he's getting no respect in the state department these days\nBy mail them as permanent Roosevelt that I'm taking it I I like that name for for a man who had such a place in history Kermit Roosevelt and not worthy American David ... is there any real effect in terms of\nThe sanctions the consequences to the U. S. for refusing to lift them if this treaty of am at sea is more sim Bali where might there be more tangible impact\nSo the tangible impact is November when President Trump has said that he will impose the full sanctions on Iran He's given allies warning that this was coming\nAnd those sanctions if he does it as he has pronounce would say to any ... company around the world but particularly European companies\nIf you do business with Iran you're not doing business with the United states and it's an effort to choke off the Iranians\nBy making the big aircraft makers Boeing's ready pulled out the big um oil a production equipment makers all get out of Iran and they were doing that what's happening now though is that the ... the Europeans are saying we're going to find a method to buy oil from Iran\nWe're going to find a method to buy oil from Iran without clearing your than dollars so that the u._s. can effect that with the sanctions\nAnd a number of us went up and met a with the Iranian foreign minister when he was at the un ah last week and he made an argument to sue sue Saturday evening\nThat he believed that this method was going to come together so we're heading toward a conflict between the U.S and its European allies over on\nDo we have a sense I think I feel like the the big issue really is runs nuclear program and the argument from the other nations who are still signatories to this this deal the Iran nuclear deal\nIs that it's it's not perfect but it's good and that it has done something to impede Iran's ability to develop\nA nuclear weapon do we have a sense of where we stand in that regard setting the economic stuff aside for a moment just this put us any closer on that path\nWe still kind of in a holding pattern I mean what is what's that looks like\nThe Europeans as you say they they consistently say that they they don't want to North Korea is I mean this was of course before we became buddy buddy and\nPresident Trump declared that he and Kim Jong un or love\nUh we we didn't want to North Korea is in the sense that we didn't want this to very active or potentially rogue nuclear states and so I'm a checked Iran was always going to be better than an unchecked Iran and so that was the Europeans argument as to why", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "06"}
