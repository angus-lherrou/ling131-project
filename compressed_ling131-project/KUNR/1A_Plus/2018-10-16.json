face ballot initiatives on expanding Medicaid on medical marijuana or other health measures\nJoining us in Studio to talk about these trends is read Wilson national correspondent for the hill read

welcome thank you so much Julie let me start with you and we'll start with Medicaid expansion we want to go through a bunch of different kinds of legislation over the course of this conversation\nBut we'll start with Medicaid first of all just give us the basic remind us what Medicaid expansion me\nWhen the Affordable CARE Act was passed in twenty ten every state was supposed to expand Medicaid the idea was that for um middle income people there would be subsidies to help them buy private insurance\nAnd for lower income people and they extended that all the way up to a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty I'm about sixteen thousand dollars a year those people were supposed to get Medicaid for the first time you could get Medicaid if you just had a low income you didn't have to be\nI'm pregnant or child or a senior citizen or someone with a disability a and it went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court to everybody's surprise said um this is going to be voluntary for the state states don't have to expand Medicaid will Congress had said that they were going to pay a hundred percent of\nThe cost for the first three years and then going down only to Ninety percent for going forward\nFor this um population so for most states it was a no brainer you're basically getting free federal money to help people get health insurance and the blue states all jumped to expand and eventually some of the red states jumped to expand but we're now down to roughly a dozen and a half states that have not expand it\nThat's what we're looking at now and interestingly on the ballot in three very red states that didn't expand a voters are going to decide whether or not they're going to expand Medicaid\nMm\nIt's eight Nineteen you are listening to KU when our

looking at state trends in health care law's with Julie Rovner chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news Scott Greenberger executive editor of state line and read Wilson national correspondent for the hill before we move on from Medicaid read I Do want to get your ...\nThe hill before we move on from Medicaid read\nI I Do want to get your sense of kind of where this is going only one state Maine has approved Medicaid expansion through the ballot box so voters in Maine voted for expanding Medicaid but the governor of Maine Paul the page still refuses to do so\nHe talked about his opposition to expanding Medicaid during the morning talk show on W. V. O. M. radio back in July here's part of what means governors said\nOne thing I Know is nobody can force me to put state in red ink and I will not do that so I can tell I mean I go to jail before I put the ... the stage and read it and if that's the core tells me I have to do it then we're going to be going to jail\nThat's part of Maine Governor Paula page speaking back in July and I read ... telling voters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political feet or I mean has this kind of ...\nWell a ... page is a he was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh ... it was the loud and and bombastic candidates in a one two races that uh\nUh he probably shouldn't have one in the political side and that you know main is a pretty liberal state and\nI came into shake up the old order and that that's what voters elected in foreign uh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters um the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point ... just turned out this year or the Democratic candidate is leading in most of the surveys that ah that that up there\nUm but now it has not happened yet and as a consequence of all the pages actions there are thousands of people in in Maine who not only voted for this thing but voted for this thing and now don't have the health care that they that they need and this is a it's a problem in Maine especially in\nThis is a it's a problem in Maine especially in communities that have been hard hit by things like climate change the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the state along the northern coast or is it has been pretty devastated and they work for very low wages in pretty dangerous jobs in a ... you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs and issue I think that everybody sooner or later has to grapple with now dozens of states pass laws this year\nThe aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you we spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about this and about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am representative Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the ... paid the retail price of the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that there might be another option for you\nThat other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would have been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned that the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers Kennedy and for their democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag\nFor their democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban these so called gag clauses and the bill had not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that Rhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with their with their pharmacist in and learn what their their pricing options are because of that is consistently one of the big complaints we hear from our\nConstituents on a on a regular basis as how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed laws like this\nWill be these gag or clauses are are pretty common and uh\nLast year there were a over a dozen states that [noise] excuse me took up legislation or having to do with these gag clauses um and actually just recently President Trump signed a bill outlawing these um gag clauses this was kind of low hanging fruit though of a\nOf a drug the drug prices issue a I don't think anyone like these gag clauses but ah\nThat that will the federal legislation in the state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggled to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nSince you mentioned the president's he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these gang clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nThe no the lowest price active two thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices that and uh obviously based in the navy you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices at different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact too\nWhere to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to ah\nIt's called the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have that a lot of people didn't want to have that but now we have it and it's going to really drive prices\nScott back up to the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law in this a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest of these laws and the country what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with this kind of progressive legislation is and that is in the lead on this on California is trying to reduce drug prices through transparency in other words they are\nRequiring um uh the drug companies to be public about a price increases increases beyond a certain point in the idea\nIs that uh if these are made public that they'll sort of be shamed into into reversing some of these increases it's still too early to say though whether this is going to have the desired effect um nevertheless other states this year California passed its bill or in two thousand Seventeen and last year you had five\nMore states um Connecticut Maine New Hampshire Oregon in Vermont all passed a drug pricing laws that are similar\nTo California so we'll see whether transparency is enough to reduce prices and then in addition to that\nUm some states have tried to go even even further than that Massachusetts passed a bill that would've allowed a\nIts Medicaid program to exclude some drugs from the a formula and the the um [noise] uh the group of drugs that are available to Medicaid recipients and the idea was that this would give them some leverage when to go\nTo Medicaid recipients and the idea was that this would give them some leverage when negotiating with a drug companies over prices if they were able to exclude some FDA approved drugs and and as of right now Medicaid state Medicaid programs have to include all\nFDA approved drugs in their formula or the idea was that if they were able to exclude drugs that would give them leverage in negotiating on prices but uh the federal government shutdown that that effort by Massachusetts\nI Want to make our understand the argument from Massachusetts what they were trying to do and again you see the federal government shut that down so Massachusetts does not do this now run out for an hour an hour now but the ... it sounds like you're saying the argument is you know find Massachusetts and you know Julie is the drug company I could say hey Julie this medication that we know is FDA approved is still too expensive\nAnd we're not going to just pay blanket leave for a medication we think it's too expensive so you have to keep negotiating or we're not going to we're not going to honor that part of the\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the Annenberg Foundation committed

trends in labor unions and collective bargaining public employee unions have been in the spotlight this year with teachers' strikes this spring and the Supreme Court decision this summer that affects collective bargain\nThis spring and the Supreme Court decision this summer that affects collective bargaining how is the labor movement doing in your state perhaps there are laws where you live that prevent people from organizing for better wages or working conditions or benefits tell us what's going on where you are leaving the voicemail eight five five\nTo three fix one a one day we also know there are thousands of hotel workers on strike across the country\nHave you benefited from union membership or perhaps do you think that unions have too much power in your state tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a our series the state we're in continues next Monday on\nOne day back now to our conversation with read Wilson Julie Rovner and Scott Greenberg are still time to get in a few more of your questions and thoughts about state health care policy where you live one a at W. A. M. U. dot org Julie let's get to that question for months in law who tweeted\nIsn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support\nIs that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer\nPlan has a high deductible well\nOf course the people who have an employer plans with a high deductible our our big problem in the lower income people of those have a particular large problem if you have many thousands of dollars in deductibles have to pay before your insurance kicks and\nThere are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to ah basically fell in with employer insurance but generally Medicaid has sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off the way the Affordable CARE Act was created with those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get 'em medicated people between a hundred and\nI'm thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get\n'em medicated people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts they don't have those big deductibles so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin we're constantly shifting back and forth\nBetween medicate and private plans and basically what they would do is the state was allowed to basically buy them into the private plan so they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere two weeks sidebar for just a second let me to the point of the series is to talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter every human being in the United states of America should have equally good planned one simple set of health care costs and there are other Americans who believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and the needs to be for ...\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going Julie\nActually it's where it's going is back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all these sort of small incremental changes that the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act was intended\nTo create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states still do an enormous amount of regulation of health care they always have the federal government has always been sort of the the junior partner to the states um\nGovernment has always been sort of the the junior partner to the states um but it had gotten so such a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you lived in what kind of healthcare you were able to get to the Affordable CARE Act was trying to say\nThere's a floor beneath which people won't fall that is slowly being chipped away and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the Affordable CARE Act passed Scott\nYou get the sense that this means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding than it is taking us back to where we were before him as\nWell as Julie said it is in some states but in states that want to go in a different direction again that California Massachusetts states like that they are re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example\nA on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... offer all of the benefits\nThat were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they are joined the federal level um insurance is regulated at the state level and if you're going to sell insurance and our state you are going to abide by these rules\nI'll tell you one issue read that states and many people have been hoping the federal government will act on and it's the it's kind of moved on anyway and that's dealing with medical marijuana it's on the ballot in some states again this year about twenty two states have already legalized pot for medical use some of legalized for recreational use\nVoters in Utah will choose whether to join the states or not and the political battleground seems to have shifted and I want to read if you see it this way for more traditionally liberal states into more conservative areas overtime or\nAnd it's not just the medical that has gone that way but also list\nAnd it's not just the medical that has gone that way but also legalization of recreational marijuana the two states where a legalization is going to be on the ballot this year is in Michigan in North Dakota a minute\nYou know for legal legal recreational you know in in on the medical side there are three different amendments in Missouri which is nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which are and then that Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved it this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana or we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with this debate or it came up and you know in Florida last year and\nLast year two years ago um but this is this is now a debate that I think it shows the shift in the political conversation around marijuana the sorts of people who approve of\nA marijuana legalization tend to be a older white males funny enough\nAnd then the millennial generation that the younger the basically the younger you are the more in favor of\nA legalization you happen to be um the older white males the theory is that's the that's the sort of libertarian streak or they don't want the government regulating something that\nThey don't think the government has a hand in regulating and the real swing voters or perhaps not surprisingly come down to suburban women are in talking to the people who run campaigns for and against marijuana legalization or basically the battleground is mothers who are worried that their kids are going to be exposed to marijuana\nSo you get the proponents are talking about the law enforcement to ability and and the fact that not that this will not expand the market into younger people who will then have access to recreational\nThe younger people who will then have access to recreational marijuana and then you've got the opponents who say exactly the opposite that legalization will in fact\nUh begin to rope and a bunch of kids why are there are three items in Missouri so they're all on the ballot from different ah proponents different sides of it with two of them are from a actual citizen groups that they put them on about those are amendment to an amendment three and then there's a proposition which is currently run I think the proposition\nGoes on the ballot from the state legislatures that's going to be some kind of\nCompromise or a piece that's proposition see 'em and they are all sort of competing\nWith each other and this underscores another piece of\nThe evolution of of marijuana politics\nPots big business or in a lot of these states that have legalized Colorado Washington Oregon a California Nevada Alaska or Massachusetts and Maine are the people who are setting up a ... who get to write these laws also essentially get to determine who's in the market\nUm and who owns a very lucrative space one of the biggest opponents of recreational legalization in a bunch of early states where the people who ran medical marijuana shops because they already have the monopoly right why dilute the monopoly with other people\nI should know by the way we did a program this year about state laws on marijuana and the business of pie you can find that on line at the one a dot org\nScott a couple of things to add to what to read said on this very interesting issue um at one is that it's sort of intersects with what we talked about earlier the opioid crisis because there are many people\nAre supporters of medical marijuana who argue that this is a viable alternative to uh to opioids for people who have chronic pain and then also I think we've written about this\nPeople who have chronic pain and then also I think we've written about this um it's interesting that social justice provisions are finding their way into\nMarijuana bills or this idea that a a minority communities or had been the most impacted by the war on drugs and therefore uh as we move towards legalization of makes sense to include in these bills provisions that a\n... on the one hand would allow people to uh to expunged they're a criminal records um for small amounts of marijuana but also some of these bills are calling for investment in these communities that we're most impacted and and also as a Reid said it's big business\nOr a step up for for people who were members these communities so they can get into this very lucrative business\nCelebrating fifty five

I I was thinking what if he said now I've seen the hurricane situations I change my mind that really is climate change and I thought wow what an impact\nWhat an ... I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about it all down the aisle news they say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael says that they say I mean they all say that in the end but what about ... scientists who say it's worse than ever\nClearly climate change it's tough to discuss despite overwhelming scientific evidence of its existence\nOr maybe because of that evidence I mean think about it if someone tried to hit you over the head with a bunch of facts\nAnd figures Supreme Lee confident that they are right and you are wrong how would you feel or if someone flat out refused to hear you out despite the facts being really clear and just dug in their heels to avoid feeling like they lost an argument\nWould that be like\nWe want to elevate the debate to change\nThe like we want to elevate this debate to change the way we talk about climate change and we want to hear from you where do you stand on the issue and what has it been like discussing it with people whose views are different from yours\nWhat's worked and what has not email is one a at W. A. M. U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one egg\nJoining us from K. U. L. W. public radio in Seattle is Sarah ... a research associate at the University of Washington shields a PHD in ecology from UC Davis she also founded the ... Institute a group that empowers leaders to tackle climate change Sarah welcome to want to say\nThanks for having me joining us from NPR in New York is Paul Bledsoe a lecturer at American University's Center for environmental policy American owns W. A. M. U. the station that produces won a he's also a former climate advisor to the Clinton White house and a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute poll welcome\nThank structural Sarah I Wonder if we should just framed the discussion very clearly first of all this is a conversation that's for skeptics and believers alike right this is bigger than just is climate change real do this kind of feels to me like the human aspect\nOf working our way through this issue right\nYeah I definitely this is something that\nImpacts all of the political decision making aspects of our public life right now how we're integrating science and how were you how we're essentially distorting science across this partisan divide that Israeli characterizing this political moment in our nation right now\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Subaru featuring the all new three row was sent with eating for up to eight and a choice of second row captain's chairs love it's what makes us Subaru Subaru learn more at Subaru dot com\nFrom fidelity investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learned more fidelity dot com slash wealth fidelity brokerage services El Al ... and from Americans for the arts\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson we're discussing climate change and what we discuss when we discuss climate change\nWith Sarah my re founder of the ruined Institute and Paul Bledsoe a promissory Electra at American University Center for environmental policy\nWe love to hear from you to wherever you are on the spectrum of belief with regards to climate change what kind of conversations\nAre you having with people in your life about climate change have you been able to win any one over have you had any arguments that just went sideways tell us what this conversation spin like for you comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U.\nDot org we know that for quite a few if you're discussing climate change can be difficult so have you been giving us your suggestions\nFor what has worked for you or what might work Melissa writes\nFor what has worked for you and what might work\nMelissa writes for my Bible friends I remind them that we are called to be good stewards of the earth\nNothing the environmentalist or suggesting would cause harm from my fiscally conservative friends I talk about the economics green power is more profitable and this is the future economy more jobs better jobs saving the earth for their grandchildren is way down on the list\nWe also heard from some of you who are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\nI recently graduated Okrent wrote that said and environmental science and I'm very interested in protecting the environment and teaching others about\nClimate change\nI Want to know ways in which I can better explain myself to others are\nJust regular people who might not have the education that I had about climate change because from where I'm standing at plainly ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with his poll I Wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add to your comment the terminology often gets us in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking\nAbout all this it's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy solution\nSolutions the energy solutions with a policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action\nWe know that we have to peak global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states denies factual information over twenty year period than elects a president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinions on climate\nKatie emailed my family has vacation in Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he will consider that just maybe there is a greater thing at play here what is it\nThat just maybe there is a greater thing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening change the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation nurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in the last that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and\nYou know this is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me\nLike six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it people can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think is through um through relationship and trust and empathy um because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with\nThe scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger um [noise]\nI anxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions we shouldn't into our part is in corners where we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why\nWe become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSarah if I could just dig in a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak to the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean\nIt's hard not to read the latest report from the un climate change by which we discussed last week on this program\nAnd not feel like well we're all going to die anyway why bother run up your credit because they're not going to be around to collect you know what I'm saying like it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long way\nI Want to so yeah I got it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we sit\nWith the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that we're living a science fiction fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us\nAnd specifically in the U. S. Native American and indigenous Native American people\nWho have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at down the line\nAnd ... the the consequences from climate change we can look at the stories of human tenacity and how people struggle and survive through massive massive chefs we know these stories and we can inform our strengths and resilience our courage\nInform our strengths and resilience our courage by looking at the stories of for example the water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now saying the earth is precious we only have one planet and we're all going to show up and\nI'm informed that the you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place and and staying vigilant\nI Would just go go ahead go ahead ... but oh I Would just add that\nThe St Louis them is a reasonable reaction if you don't know the full range of solutions\nThat there's a lot of good news here\nTwo years ago we eliminated one of them six main greenhouse gases it will no longer exist on earth Twenty years from now with the golly agreement to phase out HFCs\nTurns out there three or four other super pollutants like methane and black carbon if we can reduce these quickly about three times the current rate\nWe can limit near term warming and prevent runaway climate change we need education about the fact that we can take hold of the climate crisis and actually solve it\nTo exactly to combat that fake lives in which is a serious problem and I I really do feel empathy for people who are overwhelmed by a ... a little further what our HFCs\nAgencies are hydra floor carbon or manmade gas that ironically are used in refrigeration in air conditioners and they're growing incredibly quickly because we phased out an earlier set of see it\nPhased out an earlier set of CFCs chlorofluorocarbons\nTo fix the ozone hole by the way it's worth noting that that happened under Ronald Reagan a Republican so also noting that the acid rain problem was solved under George W Bush a Republican Republicans have historically taken very responsible positions\nOn environmental problems but they've gone off the rails lately and we need to help them help them back\nWith a high near Seventy to go out and enjoy this great weather [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from log me in makers of go to

democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along that she is indeed of tribal heritage protest was the clock back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders said direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard\nIt's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters\nTalking head of the midterms if you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant to you what tribe or are you part of and how does that factor into your life leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a\nNow if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life what did you discover\nAnd how did it change you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will\nShare some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nNow to our conversation with Sarah ... and Paul blitz so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on Noel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kind of like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shuts down and drains you need to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights so if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate\nIn climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives there still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical\nWhen you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take large policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who\nAcknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida um but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nThink one of the kind of saving grace of the er at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but just being able to have the conversation in a useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so\nKind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change sorter role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would happen to years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that well\nI mean bad things are happening right now so [laughter] there is evidence that um that the those projections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of projections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentrations in we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nAnd and so like [noise]\nYes and there's so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season Audi of different places are influenced\nBy the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why\nAnd people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for earth planet\nYears right and the the the climate for earth planet has been ... authorizations between glacial an inter glacial states\nAbrupt warming into into glacial followed by slow cooling into glacial states so that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by the changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sons\nOf Sarah back up along the changing geometric relationship between glacial into glacial steak house last me it's so cool it's amazing what it's confusing like like bring it down to earth from me\nOkay so in the last million years the the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states where there's an ice on top of North American\nAnd you're Asian continent sea level is lower um it's a colder climate um and then in ... states so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis um this piecing this um oscillation its ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and that heartbeat from cold too warm or cold too warm that heartbeat was paste\nBy the way goals and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth tilt as it moves around the sun\nSo I Want to make sure I'm following you just yeah heartbeat this earth heartbeat between yeah whole too warm cold too warm\nIt's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat as off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that what you're saying that's exactly right I like ... okay that makes a youthful\nPattern that's been on that's been happening for the last ... million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed that pets\nYears we ... we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern I was saying earlier on a super\nHigh cholesterol sugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof and um the climate system can't take that forever that will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes\nPerfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and then we got to let you go shortly but for folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases they're under stating the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed a degree and a half Fahrenheit were on her way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that that's just the factual information I I I think we went with very few people actually deny about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the u._s. public actually\nDenied climate science what I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who

commented on it which is we don't do enough to educate on it you know my my uh girls in school now\nAnd they don't have a standard course in the public school system on basic cyber cyber security and unfortunately you need it right now or it's not a safe space and part of learning how to make it safe is\nEducating people both at the consumer level and one of the things I talk about it in the books even at our most sophisticated institutions let's say MIT\nLearning cyber security unlike how to code was not part of the basic curriculum so even at the highest levels people weren't thinking about this day to day I Hope that there's time for a change in that it doesn't depend on just your behavior ... uh Joshua which is\nYou know when I grew up in New York in the eighties\nThe ah it used to be if you made eye contact with someone or you know if you didn't cross the street when you saw someone than it was your fault if you've got that there's a famous Saturday Night live skit it's like why did you make eye contact and what do you expect to get out of that that's kind of today on the Internet right like if you don't change your\nThat's kinda today on the Internet right like if you don't change your alpha new Merrick a thirty character\nPassword every thirty days for the twenty five different accounts you have that it's your fault as a consumer I don't think we're ever going to get out of it if that's our mindset well we need to do is focus ON Technology\nThat makes it easier for consumers to use and also recognize there's maybe some stuff we just shouldn't be doing using a protocol that's fundamentally not secure\nI Do think that we are having a slightly more sophisticated conversation these days I mean even that maybe in the county west had with President Trump in the oval office there was that shot of him sitting at the resolute desk opening his phone and his password was zero zero zero zero zero which for those replaying the home game and\nHe was a really bad password to we pick apart what you're referring to as the code war you see that it bears some resemblance to the\nWar in what ways\nI think we're in for a generational struggle and that that struggle is going to include not just the use of force but the setting a whose values prevail who's norms prevail about the world that we want to live in\nAnd then you need to execute on those values with your tactics so you do deterrent bring criminal cases make public behavior that you think is unacceptable like\nThe Russian uh now where not touch a that indiscriminately hit companies around the world like Maersk shipping FedEx hospitals and took them off line\nI think we can partner with countries that share our values around the world works\nCountries that share our values around the world worked together to collectively impose a cost on a rogue actor like Russia when they do that type of activity to say this is unacceptable it's not going to change overnight though just like the Cold War\nIt's going to take years and years and years of day in day out fighting and this war has already begun and part of what I was telling their stories that\nWe didn't used to tell that we kept secret inside government but now we're trying to make public\nThink importantly so that consumers so that companies can ... ah realize that were already in this conflict and start taking steps to be a part of it\nYou quote your old boss early in the book here's part of what Bob Mueller said in his speech you worked on back in two thousand seven it's a fairly long quote but I Want to read it in its entirety here's part of what Bob Mueller said at the time quote\nThere is an old saying that all roads lead to roam in the days of the Roman empire roads radiate it out from the capital city spending more than fifty two thousand miles\nThe Romans built these roads to access the vast areas they had conquered but in the end the same roads lead to rooms downfall for they allowed the invaders to march right up to the city's gates he goes on to say quote\nThe Internet has opened up thousands of new roads for each of us new ideas and information new sights and sounds new people and places but the invaders\nThose whose intent is not enlightenment but exploitation and extremism are marching right down those same roads to attack us in multiple ways unquote is this another Roman moment so we kind

I think it could be if we don't realize the moments or the moment that that we're in I remember vividly when a when director Mahler gave that speech we're out in uh in in the Pennsylvania area it was the first major speech\nOn cyber as a national security threat think about that it's now considered\nBy the director of national intelligence all the major officials to be the top threat it was only around ten years ago that we've been talked about it seriously from the director the FBI for the first time I know you have like a a guest on later I'm a number of former Justice Department person Monica Becker from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that terrorists al ... used aviation which has done so much good and connected us around the world\nAnd they turned it into a weapon that caused thousands of deaths\nWe started to watch terrorist groups my last two years ... division exploit social media in order to get their adherence to kill and it was working inside the United states there's one chilling case um that I talk about that still I think people haven't heard about\nA ... of the case that looks from the perspective of a company like someone's stealing customer information names addresses the type a day in day out thing that you were talking about earlier\nHowever in this case he wasn't doing it to make five hundred bucks although he did ask for five hundred bucks he also through bitcoin on the also on the back and had become friends with one of the most notorious terrorist in the world a British born citizen named ... Hussein he became\nOld a British born citizen named ... Hussein he became friends with them only through Twitter only on line\nAnd what he did with that stolen customer information that was provided to him was turn it into a kill list\nThat said using this customer information are located from his safe hole and Rocca a Syria he bombarded back to the United states through social media a list of the stolen customer information and said kill these people by name by address where they live\nThat's the new era of national security that that we're in we're criminal threats merge or blend with terrorists and national security threats and companies the private sector is on the front lines for the first time\nMichelle emailed as a person of a certain age I recall a world functioned before the digital age are total reliance on digital information is making us less safe were trading safety for convenience\nI Wonder John if Michelle has a point there used to be a time when you had to actually go to the bank to Rob it and now you don't\nShell definitely in fact one of the cases we talked about is an Internet a bank heist a where hackers managed to send human operatives to ATM machines all across the world and different countries and they used a hack\nTo simultaneously allow them to withdraw money from me and for me and I think Michelle does have a point that you know for twenty five years\nWe moved almost everything we value from analog space from books and papers to digital space and connected using a protocol the Internet's protocol that was fundamentally never designed was security in mind huge advantages to that\nNever designed was security in mind huge advantages to that economic convenience however we did so systematically and this was true in government along with the private sector without taking into account\nRisk without taking into account that the bad guys the terrorists that the rogue nation states the crooks are going to move into that space we're just starting to reckon with that\nAlso on the role of the black church in the south and another piece called what Bill Cosby taught me about flying\nIf you grew up in the south what stories do you most want to share about that experience is it still home for you what was it about that experience that shaped how you live your life today\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a if you grew up in the south what's your story and what do you think people tend to get wrong about where you grew up\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a you can also leave us a radio quality audio file using our app won a vox pop\nWill speak to the layman and share some of your stories tomorrow on one day we've been talking about the threat from cyber attacks and we know that some hackers are hell bent on stealing our secrets so\nNow might be a good time to go check your Facebook account\nThe most recent hack of the social media giant compromise about thirty million users names phone numbers emails and other personal details\nFacebook says last month attackers found a vulnerability in the code and use Facebook's view as feature\nTo steal access tokens these tokens or bits of code that let you love right in without having type your password every time it gave them whoever they are access to nearly everything your user name which devices you access Facebook with\nThe last ten places you checked into or were attacked at and personal details that you posted like your religion your hometown your birth date where you work yeah\nHometown your birth date where you work yeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account now the company and the FBI are trying to catch these hackers and this year Facebook's chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress that his company needs to raise its game\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good that connecting people can do and is Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love\nFor making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and at the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica bigger she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions as new post every day\nOr so the first thing they become aware is if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the site if you do it comes through and it's reviewed by Facebook or the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might pilot our policy so for instance terror propaganda\nNow we remove the terror propaganda that we've removed from face that's more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flags it for us now\nFor us now once content has been flagged as potentially violating our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on those content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages\nAre and making a decision if it violates the policy than ... if it doesn't violate the policy to leave it up that's got to be\nA hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area of the person is working in all constant reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise\nWe have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire content reviewers who speak all different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have native language speakers because they really understand the way that language is used so that's a big focus and are hiring once you're hired as a constant review or you're trained in all of our policies\nBut then you were assigned to become a specialist in one so for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm threats of self harm\nYou catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook that violates its terms\nWhat's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it is the kind of thing that say a reviewer or thought would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook deals with us [noise]\nAs a user would flag and then Facebook deals with\nWe still rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on the side\nThat said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag\nViolating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well and a couple of areas where it's harder every where it's working really well with terror propaganda I'm with child sexual exploitation\nWith spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can flag the vast majority of that content before anybody in the community send it to us or sees it at all\nUm in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery or terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very contextual\nFor instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the worded I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if anyone Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns I was a pattern recognition work\nWell we do some most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on\nActors themselves for instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we will remove your account even if you're not otherwise violated in our content policies we also have policies against\nOtherwise pilot in our content policies we also have policies against\nTerror organizations and our members hate organizations\nUm and so forth so if you for instance wanted to create a page to support al ... and on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens and rain does we would still remove it because we don't allow those groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it's a page that represent an al ... page that has been created for the purpose of bullying somebody\nThen it's appropriate to report the page to us the reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that is going to come through to our review teams first\nAnd so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that what's going to come through our reviewers and they'll be able to take immediate action\nAlso worth noting if you're a mobile use or like if if you're an iPhone use or if you just have one comment directly sometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or light or copy and then there's other options and in those other options there's that option to report somebody I Wonder\nHow much Facebook is facing the learning curve of a world that is learning to use Facebook I Know decides designed to be intuitive I think it is increasingly intuitive the more you use it\nAnd because you're global you've got people in some parts of the world who are just beginning for the first time to have broadband devices or to be connected to a world where there are more devices in our people how is Facebook teaching people to use Facebook\nWe definitely do outreach but you're right at different in different parts of the world people\nWe definitely do outreach but you're right it different in different parts of the world people will have different levels as experience in finding these reporting options and even just understanding how this works so we actually do the options that we offer people to report content actually do vary by location and we're always testing ways to get\nMore report to us to make it easier now there's a tension here if you just have one big red button\nAnd people can private whenever they want than two things happen one is that people might report things on what they really mean is just to hide it and get the content away from them because they don't like that person the other thing that happens is we don't have enough information about the Post's to route it to the correct reviewer right away", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Reno", "day": "16"}
