podcast pod saved the people he ran unsuccessfully to be the mayor of Baltimore and his new book is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope during the cash and welcome to one day\nIt's so good to be here tell us about the book's title on the other side of freedom what's the title about what are you trying to say they're\nHere you know I used to travel much more\nYeah you know I used to travel much more around the country talking to young people talking to to older people and what I realized that we have a deep understanding of decided freedom so we know on this side of freedom a third of all the people killed by strangers killed by police officer we know there'll be arrested more people for marijuana than all\nViolent crimes combined we know so much about decided freedom and we have a lot of work to do that I wanted to talk about like how do we get to the other side of freedom what did it look like what does it feel like how do we get there with the strategy in the plane\nBecause I Know that when I think about what freedom is at its core it's not only the essence of oppression but the presence of justice enjoy that we can get rid of all the bad things and that doesn't mean that the good things automatically come and debate here we have to fight for those\nSo that was where the other side of freedom came from it in the case for hope is that I think the hope is the fuel for all of this hope is a belief that are tomorrow's can be better than that today's and when people say the system is broken and then in response some people say oh no it was designed to be like this my takeaway is that it was designed in because people made it up we can make something better and that is the work of hope\nThere are a lot of questions that our listeners wanted to put to you about the work that you're doing about the black lives matter movement and so on I definitely want to ask you about today's political scene but before we dive into\nAll of that I'm just kind of curious to know how you are [laughter] you've been a very busy due to the last four years how are you how is life treating you\nKnow I'm OK it's a ... I I Do a lot of interviews and nobody ever asked me that so I appreciate that [laughter] I'm good I think that like I'm a I'm a happy about being around the people I knew before the protests and people that I Know really well I got to see my sister the other day and and she's grade and her two kids so so that\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Americans for the arts committed to transforming America's communities through the arts and arts education supporting the nonprofit arts industry which employs four point six million people nationwide learned more in American for the arts dot org\nAnd from the Alfred P Sloan Foundation bridging science in the arts by supporting the history of scientific theory misused in eugenics crusade premiering October sixteenth on PBS more at Sloan dot org\n\nFishes won a I'm Joshua Johnson we are speaking to dream of catching the host of the podcast pod that saved the people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope\nOne by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching helped lay the groundwork for activism\nOh you know it's funny I like don't can myself is very old but I taught a decade ago my my students do students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild [noise] uh\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because he was urging everyday like every single dad to shop and I talked to scream at every single day had to show up in our math to my students I had to be as prepared and I taught sixteen Ninety a hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lot of math or anybody who's ever been around eleven year old\nUh what I learned there were a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into pieces and\n... and break it down into pieces that are can be consumed and can be repeated back so my skill was like what I learned was not only had to like get kids to understand like when the crazy ones but like I did teach discreet skills like you know when you think touch it sometimes means multiplication right that like\nJust how to take apart these big things to make them bite size and then have students to be able to play with them in a way that they could put them back and rearrange on their on their own\nOr the second was like really understanding like what it means to\nLike do work that will have an immediate impact but we'll have a long term impact so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative numbers they struggle they like they can get it like anything lower than zero there like I don't get it\nBy the end they can fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it and that was like understanding like the arc of how to\nBuild capacity um like I learned that the third thing is I think the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got their ... and then like I work is to help\nStudents understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone with the worse teachers do is walk in the classrooms and make people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think in such a corollary to organizing that when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community\nThat like what I'm trying to do is help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know the amount I Believe they might not know how to use them\nAnd that what I can do is help them find them and then use them long after\nWe're gone let's get some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how ...\nBlack lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct\nTV with his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people know the names of the three black women who actually started B. L. M. thing Morgan's referring to Patrice ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nHas certainly think that the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that\nUh you know for those of us who are industry in Ferguson we are mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protests there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organize everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nAh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we ministry for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which I'm fortunate that there's this narrative that if that has come up that as a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized everybody the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true someone I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nThat I'm mindful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who are industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protests are so that is important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that\nUh one of the important things about having the platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president every room but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the ...\nBring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the the people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people have just sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names and in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing and the movement or that there's a small set of organizations who like\nWith a catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certain leaders to become more prominent\nWas concerned about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast is a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nIs it's interesting I think I'm always shut eye you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end of ... a portion of all the pre order sales went to the N. double ACP legal defense and that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book right so like that's I think about the book specifically\nBut in general in the face like I'm mindful of ... when we started campaign zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding\nIn the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of reach for funding specifically because of the question that you asked so over the past three years we've raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of non profits and we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we'd always important right so we created the first I was a database of police union contracts at first a public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really discreet projects [noise]\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not paid I don't know salary from the stuff so we try to do it is like\nWith just the bare necessities so that it's not just a question of like profit\nUh in with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany salmon Clinton to be a part of it they get paid as a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense um\nAnd it's not like some you know huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to rely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well\nAnd you know it's a guy at the way that I exist in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I Do have you know it's like a [laughter]\nNot only does not necessarily have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like it was a really rough um it was rough only this only a couple of months ago was the first time I've actually lived alone since the protests I've ever since you've been saying and debates\nActually lived alone since the protests have essentially been staying in the basement of a like my second parents are in the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us as you know wants to get married in the in the basement up there right second parents that's a that's a famous on\n... but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like there are these narratives of like oh I made it gets ill in dollars and it's like well now you see me on the news you human a pie cast you like to see me out of an event that that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case that I've had high incomes before and you know that they their income and wealth is pretty significant right oh\nI'm so people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about policing one of the members of the one eight text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and a free pass in our courts and society\nContrast that with another tax club or who wrote as time goes on society will bring about necessary reform but to denigrate and disregard the entire police force as an institution is ludicrous\nWhat do you think he I think you know I think for ...\nFor two thousand years we slit people's arresting call their health care we literally drained people's applied down and we were like where it's going to drain out all the impurities and people were like oh they their blood pressure they change it's like no they didn't have any blood right that that actually isn't a solution but we did it for two thousand years it was one of the most popular medical procedures\nBut it didn't work so if the goal was it the people's lives it's like actually won\nBut it didn't work so if the goal was it the people's lives it's like actually wasn't a good thing\nOr if the goal was to like pretend that you were doing good and like this was excellent and I think about policing it's like if the goal is to stop crime or like to to do any of that work like it just isn't whether how no matter how you feel about the police that just isn't happening so\nSunshine once again in highs around fifty nine for the Tahoe area [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from

freedom the case for hope let's talk about some of the more personal aspects of your life that you describe in the book there's a short section of the book\nLike page and a half were you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write code I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remembered joy and triumphs\nWhen we remember pain we're trying to protect ourselves and cope we're trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote\nTo make it to tomorrow and it's the day after tomorrow unquote talk about how those kinds of traumatic or difficult experiences as a kid kind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who would gravitate toward active as\nYou know it's interesting ah this is the first time I'm saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was I hate to re read the book we should talk [noise]\nAnd I just haven't had like having them with right back at so hopefully I write facts to\nEase one of the reasons why I wrote this chapter in the ... I can remember and now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave than it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within and grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize his head like we're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are and part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr or any other aspect to they ... they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew would pass what not to ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraints said like the constraints become so great and the way that we've learned how to\nAnd like that can strength to become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive that we can start to imagine things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd my eating by the diversity in the right and the left is at the right has always re packaging old narratives for a new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe that you've never seen a world where every woman at the right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you enter the world\nYou also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times that are rather young age\nAnd you connect that was what you call the client quiet about the sole but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the client instead of the closet because I've never hidden any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but\nI grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love the parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYou know one of the reasons why I was in Port in for me to be out in very very um [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very sort of overt way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gay today that the only way to do this work publicly with\nThe gate to think that the only way to do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it was a real like I was in the quiet and the closet\nAnd uh you know I I Walk into every room and the gay black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected within social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about my own identity\nNow I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just stay and like not have to tiptoe around it and not be ashamed to say that this happened and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally told a couple of years later they realized that he'd actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me um\nTo like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives in like that was important\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book is it like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were ... years and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right [noise] so I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlets actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my own air career if not all of my career but I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied\nYou know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian and gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception\nDo you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know\nLet's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my than it even they have to be\nYou know you know like ... I\nThink we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that they're not two ways to be gay they're like\nThe pride parade is really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is me wearing rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues is publicly as possible and like you know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life too I live so that like other people can feel like it's real re felt like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now to try to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people and people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of their results but that are that they are actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns and\nAnd in cities that are that function as small towns and they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cousin friend re like that they actually are nervous about like what privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how to use set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I've I don't feel like I Need to talk about that every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right\nSo the other thing I'll say if there's some people who like are really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your I hate\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bid for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling the a sellout unquote I Wonder how you are finding your way\nForward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so any way you are part of a media so to speak and reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism work that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were\nKnow it's like a both and great that like you know it's interesting is that all those people who who come in for for quote participating in the system those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell everybody to vote who tell people not to vote in twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics to matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary in the Washington Post and people literally there were like you're wasting your employees I Can't believe you did that\nPeople literally there were like you're wasting your employment I Can't believe you did that like president doesn't have any bearing this is just for show and it's like\nNobody is saying that now that is a ... that was a wild statement it said in its wild to say today so I think that people got a I it's unfortunate that like people getting it took all of the chaos that this president continues to\nIt was maybe eight point seven Ninety One point seven Kaye when our Reno and one point five ... and the CEO Ron line at K.

California report we love to hear from you to feel free to tweet us at one a comments on our Facebook page where you can watch a video stream or email one day at W. A. M. U. dot org before we move on from the weather and climate Louis there was one more thing you want us to to ... yeah\nI just wanted to lead to mention you know poll Rome or the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week talking about carbon taxes being the solution\nComics this week uh talking about carbon taxes being the solution to to this crisis at least in part on and you know I think it's important to recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to attacks uh on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of it because when money is at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAn economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business\nCalifornia's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality by twenty forty five which I'm sure sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to one of the policy prescriptions the I the IPC set forth\nA kind of crazy until you do it really in trouble for a very serious about doing it\nIt's a very serious about doing it um you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus 'em and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political will not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada same thing there you have prime minister Justin Trudeau trying to\nImpose a carbon tax across the country and he's running into a real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment more comments on this not my account of me tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change a good point about the economy I don't know if you listen to this program but we [noise]\nMe I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not questioning the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying\nLarry tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand I disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you hard in your home and if you want to live in Florida that as he pays a little risk of living within ... yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there you just have to absorb that\nOn the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall had to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the town cannot incorporate uh it's it's it's a tough one\nReally tough and when we're we're when we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year our Todd and I were just talking about the strength to break\nTheir existential risks that are opposed not just to\nA community is close to the coastline to when we were talking about today but large cities you know like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurvive ability about resilience or whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change is a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places\nFrom risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... ... one small point just to and if you think that that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisers had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict it means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nListen for those of you who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish you of course a speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going\nWhat your thoughts are and how things are going how well FEMA is meeting your needs state officials how well that's going we always love to hear from you feel free to email us\nOne a at W.

single please stay safe do not put your health risk for the sake of sending us a voice mail but if you're able we love to know how you're doing eight five five\nTo three six one a one eh\nLet's move on to the White House for another major official is Lee\nTo the White House where another major official is leaving the administration Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations announced her resignation on Tuesday\nA lot of people are going to want to do a lot of rain from time leaving and I want to make sure that it was a blessing to go to the un body armor every day and the American um and I always our maverick's\nFrom fighting for our country that I Will tell you that I think\nNikki Haley speaking on Tuesday about resigning as US ambassador to the un and others resignation was different from some of the others we've seen in this administration because it seemed to kind of come out of nowhere\nBy surprise last month ambassador Haley published an op ed in the Washington Post declaring her loyalty to and respect for the president Shane what is your read on Nikki Haley's resignation\nAnnouncement do we take it at face value is there more at play here what do you think\nYeah there's always more play particularly in this White House um it was a surprise there is no doubt about that it was a surprise even to people in the administration uh Nikki Haley [noise] also I think had found herself increasingly politically isolated in the power centers of foreign policy\nAnd the administration with John Bolton the national security advisor and Mike Pompeo now secretary of state\nA sort of absorbing a lot of that energy and then of course this administration being quite hostile to the United nations being UN ambassador is not necessarily the most powerful position um Nikki Haley has presidential ambitions that she'd she said today or an ... meeting with Trump this week she's not running and twenty twenty\nAnd and her meeting with Trump this week she's not running and twenty twenty she plans to be campaigning for him a twenty twenty four is not that long the way a and so I think there's an element of that as well the question of why now is a curious one that'll keep people in Washington guessing she may have thought get out before the midterms\nI'm there may be of demagogue certainly of Democrats take back the house they're going to become a subpoena factory this administration will be under investigation\nRelentlessly and Nikki Haley herself is under scrutiny for a private jet flights that she accepted from friends and associates there's been some investigation to that um it might have just a ban that now is the time to head for the exits and and I have to say she really does leave\nI'm probably one of the best positions of any senior trumpet fish official she's not leaving under a lot of scandal\nUh she won generally plaudits for her work at the un she was seen as a stabilizing force within an administration that many people feel needs them uh and she can leave with her head held high and I think uh certainly someone as smart\nAnd capable and as ambitious is Nikki Haley this is not her swan song\nYou know really that was exactly what I was gonna ask you about is this kind of how what you read into Nikki Haley's resignation compared to some of the other turnover\nIn the Trump Administration I mean it's not on precedent and former U.S ambassador to the UN to search for a year some serve for three or four years some surfer one year or so\nThe sheer duration of her term isn't necessarily telling but the uh I I don't know that we view this in the same light as say the way that like Rex Tillerson left some of the other people in this race and feel like that's a great point\nSome of the people in misery absolutely\nThat's a great point I mean frankly two years seems like a natural timeline uh for for somebody to serve in such a position and decides\nTo call it quits and um and Trevor Noah jokes he oh hey at least this this resignation was scandal free I'm so there's that you know um it's been interesting watching a chorus of uh\nOf Democrats I'm a democratic lawmakers praising her uh in the last few days I'm saying in some cases that\nSunday with a hundred and fifty two degrees that bishop today nice day sunny it was a high near Seventy to enjoy this beautiful weather [noise]\n\nSupport for

Shane Harris and Todd's will still time to get into more of your questions and thoughts on the week's top stories one eight at W. A. M. U. dot org Todd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nTodd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing his Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump\nIs using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them seem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation go\nAnd seems to have had opposite effect so at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provides though around what I'm about to say\nUh that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now it's having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging a Republican and a red state\nActually had a chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee or maybe picking up an open seat\nTo now a surge for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously in house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that has had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship\nOn house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nIn a lead or in democratic seats\nRose in a in a lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college\nUh I Would look to the house most likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January the will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like Shane said before\nThey will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee\nOr the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that church ...\nI'll add to this you know senator humbling Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary can name but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance to grill FBI Director Christopher Wray on that face to face on how much intervention\nFor re on that face to face um how much intervention did the White House do in this a supplemental background check\nWill click also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up so she's up for reelection you can bet that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd my thing I'll say it she just last night um was trying to take the fight from you know on the SCOTUS thing too\nThat the way that Trump is trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real starring in Trump's side the White House just put forth three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on them she's very upset about that and Trump\nAre tempted minutes rations really breaking from tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these ...\nI Do want to see if we can leave ... California politics for the roundup is up but a few more things out to be see\nWe wanted to discuss including the president stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just miss swift for ... to Democrats in Tennessee but he woke him Tania was to the White House yesterday Connie wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd we're going to lunch with the goal of murder or I don't want to put you in most\nJobs at all as far as the guy who let me just this guy\nI Love this guy right\nNow Connie West was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear those Shane Harris Kanye seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he had noted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEasy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity is at the other side of the resolute desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI'm not either I mean I I think it was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to dig through these deep and it's like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of said is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there's a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling\nDoes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling\nBizarre what do we make of it a behavior from a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that is right but there's also left many people scratching his head about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him a it was just a very strange moment than I Know for\nFor for for me and my colleagues who just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving past as quickly as we could do that too but I should note the county's old nemesis Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week she endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media\nThe Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British and has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand after her post\nShane Harris let me stick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... Saudi dissident and a resident of the U.S he disappeared inside the Saudi consulate\nIn Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically sent hit men to kill ... to show you because of his reporting\nThe Turkish government hasn't really provided any independent evidence for this they say they have security video and and and logs of people who signed in and so forth what are we actually know right now if anything about what really happened\nAll right well what we know right now is largely coming\nIf anything about what really happened right well what we know right now is largely coming from the Turks and Turkish security agencies\nAre what we reported last night my colleagues and I and the Post's late last night was at the Turks have told the Americans that they actually have audio recordings and video from inside the consulate that they say definitively prove ... who was an opinion writer for the post Washington Post\nA was a beaten tortured and killed and ultimately dismembered inside\nThat facility um the Americans and we understand have not seen the footage or heard it themselves but there's a growing believe within the U.S intelligence community and I think within Congress and the White House ah that the Saudis probably did kill Jamal ... are not\nAt all being forthcoming about that this is a politically difficult situation for this president in particular because the White House is so close to uh the the regime and Saudi Arabia I'm Jared Kushner the president's son in law and senior advisors actually very personally close to a man named Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince\nN.

... so uh in Istanbul and he didn't work out that is what we know for sure there are reports that they were to go\nYou know for sure that all the reports that there were two gulfstream jets that came from Saudi Arabia or with fifty men of they they go into a blackout a vans a drive to the ... so the consul general's residence which is allegedly ... show he may have been taken\nAnd they did what they did to him now there are reports circulating that attack ish intelligence have proof\nOr that or that they know what happened to him and that he was tortured and dismembered\nAnd a ... the most brutal brutal debts under the fifty men then flew back to a Saudi Arabia on the Gulf Stream jets a little later in the day now we know the the planes that were those to paint movements at different times that came into his stumble ... and then went back to Riyadh\nWho was on them what that designation was within the state capital right just widowed one hundred percent no but you get the distinct sense that ah the ... the Turkish are telling the authorities here\nOn what you thought he's here in the U.S on the side and is not a million miles from what I have just sketched out because I think that there has been a willingness to believe and that is why you're seeing\nThe deep expressions of anxiety and on these over what has unfolded ... what the implications might be there's some things that you can easily sweep onto the carpet in international affairs and there are some things that are just there are a bit more ... could I miss definitely falls into the latter category\nWhere we I Wonder if we can talk about the U.S in Saudi Arabia is relationship the real long time allies at a press conference at the oval office yesterday\nAllies at a press conference at the oval office yesterday President Trump was asked about to she'll use disappearance here's part of what the president's at\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and we're looking again this took place in Turkey\nAnd to the best of our knowledge\nBecause she'll be is not a United States citizen is that right or is that a permanent resident okay we don't like John we don't like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten million dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people think\nThe president speaking at the oval office yesterday in ... he was referring to the human Saudi Arabia and the four or five alternatives would be other countries from whom the Saudis could buy arms to hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms deal a military deal between the U.S\nAnd Saudi Arabia I Wonder if you could give us a sense of how this case\nFits into the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia especially in light of the comment that I read earlier a re read it chest sixteen forty three wrote on our website the one eight dot org\nThere is no reason to maintain close ties with the country that the heads more people than ISIS finally gives women the right to drive but it's only window dressing\nIs killing civilians in Yemen and murdered a journalist who was critical of the quote unquote royal family if I were king for a day all the weapons we've sold them would be rendered useless and Jared Kushner would be banned from any policymaking\nAnd Jared Kushner would be banned from any policy making love the sharp elbows thrown in that comment I Wonder if you could help us ...\nYeah I think um it's it's really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold lead transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we have billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I I'm so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually stand up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy\nAnd that attitude had activated a lot of\nUm people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle Chris Murphy and Rand Paul Hogan arguing for a long time just as the commentator said\nNow we're supporting the war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians and you know bus attacks and other things that are just horrendous um\nWhy don't you start having to cut you short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to a reporter this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nI think that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval so no I think that uh and less and less of a sudden the journalists turns up alive\nI think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise] plus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead so I was gonna say people like Rand Paul arts\nPaul of Kentucky where we go ahead so I was gonna say people like Rand\nPaul are going to push back against arms sales about about our support for the war in Yemen um even saw a at a law makers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that the u._s. Trump ministries and had to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I Want it there is a counterpoint to this too which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of said the quiet part out loud a little bit in the way he in a way he framed it out yesterday because\nWe have never had a relationship an alliance based on value since World War two it had all been about money and oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia\nThat didn't lead to a permanent rupture in our alliance because we've always seen them as a strategic ally not as the values faith ally as in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump's at eight and a particularly accentuated way and he feels you know is very transactional way past presidents have\nBut this is somewhat reflective of what us presidents have said quietly for a long time\nSure sure if I could chip in the ... here I\nMean I think Donald Trump said out loud what other presidents and other prime minister subsided could moments in relationships you have with regimes that are far from perfect I mean I remember when Tony Blair was prime minister\nAnd there was a huge I'm Still that was about to be concluded\nAnd the British serious fruit office launched an investigation into Saudi Arabia or had been doing whether they'd be paying kickbacks or whatever to get contracts through\nUm old ... and you know it was clear that Saudi ... you've got to cool this cooled off the dog's otherwise the deal is in jeopardy and highly unusually massively controversial Leigh Tony Blair\nUsually mercifully controversial e Tony Blair intervened with a ... an independent investigation and said right we're canceling this investigation\nAnd he used his power as prime minister because he felt he had to because Saudi Arabia was to bigger customer too important an ally\nAnd you've seen with Donald Trump you know one of the first place if he went to when he became president was to Saudi Arabia I traveled with him on that trip\nAnd it was they were one hundred percent in with Mohammed bin Salman now whether they're regrets email note is an open question however they they are they're they don't Trump is determined that the arms deal will go ahead\nJosh before we keep going and oh I was just going to\nSay if I could just add one thing that struck me as what the president didn't say he didn't mention Iran and he didn't mention the peace down as you recall last month at the un\nAnd the United states has pretty aggressive in Cali around the biggest threat to the region and by extension it was seen Saudi Arabia is that stopgap against possible Iranian expansion\nAcross the middle east on and of course on Saudi Arabia would be key to any sort of he's still so I think it's interesting that I'm a month ago we were talking about\nPolicies and going against Iran and so going forward how much will the U.S focus on Iran and stopping an Iranian expansion um shape it's reaction or lack there of um to to what's happened in Saudi Arabia and if it if and in fact is the case that they have\nKilled a journalist inside they're constantly who is it a resident of the United states\nOf journalists who have been killed there was another journalists being remembered today in Bulgaria at a funeral the body of thirty\nBulgaria at a funeral the body of thirty year old TV host Victoria Murray nova was found over the weekend use it then you ... in the northern Bulgarian town she had been raped\nThe Reno chamber orchestra and guest conductor do not do could ... perform on Saturday at seven thirty\nAnd Sunday at two pm at night and guilt concert hall\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from bona with the bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractor is committed to expertise in customer service contract to locate her and more information or at bona dot com\nFrom capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet capital one an a\nAnd from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nBack now to the friday news round up with John ... uses and Henri Friedman still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the week's top stories as well one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThe story of the president of Interpol Ming hung way who's reported missing last week by his wife that stories moved Maine was detained by Chinese authorities on corruption charges\nHe resigned in immediate effect this week the arrest as part of a larger official anti corruption campaign by China's president Xi Jinping know grace Meng the ex Interpol president's wife is speaking out she told the Associated Press that she felt threatened\nAssociated Press that she felt threatened nephews have do we have a sense that you know of why this was going on and what it is that makes me so important to the Chinese government of what this means that a larger sense well\nHe's been a long time operative of the the Chinese government and there are arguments being made that this is part of an effort to purge non loyalists to the Shia government and so there is no definitive answer but\nI think the message that um many are taken as if somebody who's been in government this long and the police capacity um could be sweat swept off the streets and his wife sent a knife ... the day the day he disappears that no one in China's safe and and at the time of all this there was talk from\nParty officials about the importance of absolute loyalty said their suggestions certainly is that somehow he was less than ... in the eyes of the government\nI Will say I think I'm One of the more interesting developments as well as his wife and how outspoken she has been she has been she's in French protective custody\nBut she's been speaking out in a way that we wouldn't normally see out of China and I thought it was an interesting development and may lead to more information coming out quicker than Chinese officials wanted to happen\nAnd so it was fascinating to watch her sort of use um the public platform in a way we see more often in the west as a way to get information about her husband and defend her husband and it's it's something we don't normally see\nWhat's hard now to Brazil were far right presidential candidate John ... surprised the nation when he shot to the top of the rings she nearly took the election with forty six percent of the vote just shy of preventing a runoff Brazilians will vote in the runoff election soon\nBrazilians will vote in the runoff election soon on October twenty eighth re Freidman can you remind us who usually ... is and what makes him and his policy platform so newsworthy\nHe's a fascinating character he's been he's a former army captain has been in a Congress for almost three decades um he's a law and order candidate that as his big thing so he says you know our crime rates are too high we need to empower the police he is very controversial and saying you know the police need to shoot first\nUm and and um shoot to kill 'em and and also to losing gun laws to address crime rates he's also very controversial in the sense that he said things that are most optimistic\nUm that are anti algae tea um and one other thing it's really important is to Brazil we often forget I'm only became a democracy in Nineteen eighty five or return to democracy Nineteen eighty five for Twenty one years ahead of dictatorship and he has spoken ... um\nAbout the time of the dictatorship as a time when there was a law and order one other point to know is that he is an armored but Donald Trump a lot of conservatives feel that Donald Trump has the right formula be pro business you know loosen regulations ah you know be nationalistic\nAnd be about cracking down on crime and he has promised to be a really close ally of the United states all of this is\nI'm very a shocking because Brazil for many days for decades has been led by a leftist government uh there was a little more ambivalent about its relationship with the United states and certainly a didn't espouse kind of the right wing views that he espoused is so this is a real shock to the system I think it really goes to the fact\nThat Brazil I mean it's in deep recession it's embroiled in a massive corruption um crisis that affected all parties except for both an arrow who is actually not been implicated in this and now it's\nThat all parties except for both an arrow who is actually not been implicated in this and that was his that was hit the winning point I'll say one other thing we you know the Atlantic read an article in which they interviewed\nA a cab driver who said you know things are so bad maybe we need someone with crazy ideas out who else is going to fix this mat and so I think that that is that is the sentiment that is worth keeping an eye on because that was a similar sentiment\nAnd bread that and Donald Trump's victory in the victory of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador Mexico I mean this is a sentiment that people are feeling against the establishment in many countries of\nThe world glad to hear from some Brazilians who are listening today and looking ahead to the election one listener emailed I'm and I'm a Brazilian listening from a city next to Brazil's capital Brasilia\nI'm very concerned about the future of our democracy the candidate leading the polls is an ex military who has a very anti democratic discourse which is also racist massages and homophobic\nSince last Sunday the election day more than fifty people have suffered physical and verbal aggressions from both so NATO supporters social media specifically what's app\nIs playing a very important role and lots of fake news is circulating I really believe that with ... out of our democracy is at risk John ... what's the projected to happen for the runoff is there any sense of whether ... could win this\nLast poll I saw suggested yes that to the latest post suggests that he is at fifty eight percent\nOn the opposition leader is at forty two percent or ... for them to her dad and so I kinda think that you'd have to say that it's it would that sort of margin of error is going to take some quite something for the left is kind of candidate to come back from that position um I mean you know they talk about violence\nFrom that position and I mean you know they talk about violence and the other thing about both NATO he ... he was stabbed\nIn September as a rally I'm so there's been a lot of violence around by his men that he's been able to say\nI really love to take part in debates I really count at the moment because I'm Still you know slightly getting for this stopping that I had things that I'm afraid I might be able to come to your studio this evening and so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is he's got he's head down he has said what he said people know exactly where he stands and I think he sees the finish line\nOne story that much of the world has been talking about has to do with a new report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the eyepiece Sisi\nThe report says that the world is quickly running out of time to stem catastrophic climate change scientists predict we're on course to go beyond a crucial threshold of the world's average temperature rising one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nIn just over about ten years they said that would leave us dealing with the risks of extreme drought wildfires floods food shortages for hundreds of millions of people we talked about this report\nThe program this week one comment from a listener stuck along the lines that at least here in America\nThis is just not a big enough issue I mean people will vote for a lot of reasons and the state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about or that voters demand to discuss Nancy use if what is your sense of that of whether or not this report has made an impact around the world enough for people to start\nAction I think it's made an impact\nStart demanding action\nI think it's made an impact but the problem is the effects of this already being seen in various ways around the world so where one country can say it's not a big impact another country could see it as an immediate impact on something that needs to be dealt with aggressively and of course the kinds of changes at this report says need to happen are so I'm\nDrastic that it demands sort of a uniform world agreed upon action and we're not there yet and so I'm ... years scene of variance in response and I think it really reflects the variants have impact that nations are already seen\nAnd you know as a as a war correspondent and one of the things I see it come up most often as as a cause of the start of wars and conflicts environmental changes changing where people live how they're able to eat so um\nYou eat it's an area that doesn't just hit the environment but really hits other parts of of national security and government writ large but there's because of the complexity in terms of its impact\nI think it's hard to get a uniform agreement particularly to in such a polarized time um so it's hard to be optimistic that that will see at least in the short term the kinds of drastic changes at this report says needs to happen to stop literally famine drought wildfires really severe consequences\nI was in Europe at the beginning of the week and when the report came out on and on the main national news shows a half an hour long for the same as the nightly news programs here the the first six seven minutes we're devoted to these are the CDC report\nI Wonder how much was devoted I mean that's one of the things that really strikes me about living here\nI mean that's one of the things that really strikes me about living here ... ... in America where you get more whether I think the square inch than any other\nKind of country on the planet or you could huge amount about whether the climate is not discussed and that is one of the things that really strikes me whereas I think there's a much greater consciousness whether they're doing that much about it is another issue but I think that you know I Am struck by how\nA lift all
