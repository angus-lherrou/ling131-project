the line hey Heather what's on your mind what'd you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it but I loved it for entertainment value but my big piece was that moment when he brought her onstage and knowing that was not her comfort zone knowing what she'd been told that she wasn't going to be good enough that no one would care that knows where to find her interesting or attractive and\nShe just went out and she killed it and they loved it and for that has second ISI that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her that was a pretty important moment if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself out there for the same reason\nIs kind of a big moment yeah I I I hear you on that just does that resonate for you in a way like was there something personal that that made you flash back to er sad about LA\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know I Do a lot of things where I have to go out in front of crowd or in front of people and you often hear you know you need to be dinner or project lower or beat this or that are younger and at\nThat moment with kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that moment that we can personalize it whether it's an interview or what have you and I think that was an import it\nIt showed interview or what have you and I think that was a part\nOf it has her what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her nose\nYeah yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she's like this is my name is all needs to take me as I Am and she worked at it you know got to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and um\nThought it it kind of the deal\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that Ali billboard and he says we should have just made the old billboard your nose\nThat thing about the comments about her nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a\nExist and and thrive in Hollywood as far as a coming of the music industry it absolutely is a powerful comment on the music industry\nAs the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing has placed in time where this movie is place in time it's interesting to think about that\nBecause almost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's really no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming playlists and um\nThe major record labels having less power than they used to so it's almost like old fashioned and its view of the music industry but only that view would would\nAnd it's fear of the music industry but only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also chime in but by the way for those who have not seen a star is born will not be seeing stars form or just kind of want to be in on the conversation she tells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose your nose just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go into homes I Wonder how you view that commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie\nI felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art I also thought about pink\nWho's very much and invention of pop music but who also have this kind of rye cynical style style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways is very linear it's a very linear idea of there is one um road to fame there is one path you just simply offend or D sand as opposed to\nThere's no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following\nShe would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWith out kind of going through that traditional Paso agree with Anna about that but I think\nThat um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them passed each other on this fame ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about Lady Gaga you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who has been so able\nTo make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean the funny thing about this movie as she is way more important to culture than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from you know Bradley Cooper without a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd in that way\nYeah except for the voice in rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean she is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley spent a lot of time sitting up that first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a store is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga is character Ali used as improvising all of saw\nHim on this phone thing\n[noise]\nI can do\nTo me [noise]\n\nBradley Cooper Lady Gaga in a star is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano and sang and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we sang together I mean everything's alive we said we sing everything live in the movie wow you there's nothing we're not just lives thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's seen next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in is seen as actors fully believing that you're the character you cannot believe it yourself so she really gave me that confidence\nBradley Cooper speaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration between Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga particularly how it came out in the way the love story played out\nThis is my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meets jak he was a stumbling blackout drunk\nAnd I think it looks as if he's just been a weekend at a bar to Kevin Kevin ... and I don't find that interesting or attractive if she had met him sober and he\nAnd I don't find that interesting or attractive if she had met him sober and he fell into alcoholism\nAnd stayed with him it would be more interesting he's he's increasingly mean he has petty\nAnd I think as his alcoholism ... becomes words he continues to treat her worse and yes he's Bradley Cooper and yes he's is incredibly talented musician but I never really bought fully what alleys saw in him\nFifty seven sunshine friday through Saturday was temps in the low sixties for the local area\n[laughter]\nSupport

let's get to a few more of your calls now gene is listening in Indianapolis hey gene what did you think of a star is born can you hear me\nYes I gave it five stars which why five stars [noise]\nUm actually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one scene particularly well updated to today um I thought it was the the irony of being discovered\nBecause he was a drunk and looking for a drink and their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was that continually thing and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent\nI guess he was her agent uh the guy who made her over the manager down agent played yeah what what is the main character\nI didn't like him and I I guess I wasn't supposed to\n... what is your main character\nI didn't like him and I I guess I wasn't supposed to but ah the minute he had that conversation with Jackson um and and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him\nOf being a problem in that whole relationship I just I just knew that that was going to be the start of of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear your dream a hundred percent of ... and I I figure I heard you trying to get his will\nThat was a male nominee go yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of the story one of the tricks with the manager is I think\nThey do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is I'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them from the beginning\nUm but then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forced element that\nIt doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed that because when he's been through these um recovery process\nIs does it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate and a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that\nDid the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough to drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was\nBy agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell and there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example he goes on states to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps for getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened as I used to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way for me\nIt exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's\nPart of that the narrative issue with the ending\nLet's all go ahead and go ahead\nWell of course of course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine or the fame monster is like the guy got what's called ... and one of her album a destroys people is a a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of star is born in there and in fact all the bridges of the SARS going to have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I absolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost with us\nWhereas in in some of the previous versions he almost with a sympathetic enabler um of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know we're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name a valley in the star is born versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of the part of the cast you know has to be there um\nI also just want to say before we end got to get this out there that um this is also the story of how a woman's rise leads to a man's fall [laughter]\nAnd that's\nAn internal problem with the stars bar and you know um it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama is traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic a ... toward the lead female character but there is this underlying sense\nHave to say it that even as Jackson, Maine is\nSaved temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from his young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushing the periphery feminist reading problematic found well\nBut you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a feeling male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era you get to a few more of your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying\nIn Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen\nFor stars I deeply appreciative ... nuanced shyness in her early portrayal which made Maine's characters advising her work well I'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance\nHis scenes seemed a little too detached from Maine overall I Love the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from our bureau in ... North Carolina who tweeted three stars a star is born was a story the performances especially the musical ones were fantastic\nAnd the cinematography was incredible I expect a lot of nominations to come for deep ie the director of photography the cinematographer Matthew ... production designer Karen Murphy costumer ... score original song\nAnd editing John horn spoke with the cinematographer Matthew ... about shooting live performances\nWhich are not really straightforward spaces to navigate here as a part of that conversation from Cape PC sees the frame\nThis film was very difficult to sort of navigate the stage performances because we had three different modes basically we had the Coachella mode which is I'm borrowing stages or that were already set up with a lady that was already existing\nAnd putting in our own crowds and then there was the I'm running guns sort of we have ten minutes to shoot in between two sets with a real audience\nApologizing in thanking the audience for I'm sort of I'm shooting a movie in between two bands and then we had the third which is the Greek theater which in which shallow was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie\nWe're in which shallow was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie fashion was able to create the Greek theater as a set\nAnd put a certain amount of crowded and so that was my most controlled um scenario but the lighting of it had to have a consistency like my goal was that um you know in creating a a character from St Louis cinematography standpoint Jackson, Maine might as well be um\n[noise] oh I don't know Jack White and I had to make sure that the ...\nThe audience maybe supposedly filled the this is his lady in this is his road show and it's also in the film in the sort of visual movement them but a representation of rock and roll\nThat was ... the cinematographer on a star is born speaking to John horn on Cape he sees the frame John can you talk a little bit more about the making of this film particularly back to Kathleen question who wrote on Facebook how you can tell if a film is well directed this kind of a film\nThe way the math you described it presents all kinds of additional challenges to make it a well directed film shooting in so many different kinds of locations\nYeah I think the ultimate question about what is it is not a well directed film is do you believe it do you believe you're watching Bradley Cooper or do you believe you're watching Jackson made if you think you're watching the actor you're not in a well directed movie if you are with the character\nYou're in a well directed moving there are certain different ways to achieve that and I think Bradley Cooper does achieve it and I think one of the things that he achieved really well is an immaculate but he talked about this the seeing the performance of shallow so you have to direct that seen as concert footage it has to be compelling it's an audience to watch these two people play music\nThey can't even our public radio apple by Helen your smart speaker to play KU when our\nIt's nine o'clock in the black lives matter movement has no central leadership\nBut it does have some big names like ... cats and how does he see his place in the fight for justice from W.

[noise]\n\nThis is one day I'm Joshua Johnson in Washington [noise]\nJohnson in Washington [noise]\nHappened four years ago\nFerguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed an unarmed black man\nThe young man Michael Brown late in the street for four hours\nWeeks of protests followed thousands of demonstrators from Ferguson and beyond police fired tear gas\nDeployed riots [noise]\nArea and they even set up a so called five second rule where anyone who stood still for more than five seconds was arrested [noise]\n\nHow did the ... go from Minneapolis to Ferguson, Missouri those protests and the police response to them cutting my caissons I\nHe was a community organizer from Baltimore working for the Minneapolis public schools he drove from Minnesota to Missouri nine hours each way to protest soon he was making that trip a lot and eventually he quit that job and moved to Missouri to organize full time\nToday for years later activism is just part of my caissons identity he also hosts the podcast pod saved the people he ran unsuccessfully to be the mayor of Baltimore and his new book is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope during the cast and welcome to winning\nIt sounds good to be here tell us about the book's title on the other side of freedom what's the title about what are you trying to say they're\nHere you know I used to travel much more around the country talking to young people talking to to older people and what I realized that we have a deep understanding of decided freedom so we know in this house\nRealizes that we have a deep understanding of decided freedom so we know on this side of freedom a third of all the people killed by strangers killed by police officer we know that we're as more people for marijuana than all\nViolent crimes combined we know so much about decided freedom and we have a lot of work to do that I wanted to talk about like how do we get to the other side of freedom what does it look like what does it feel like how do we get there with the strategy and the plane\nBecause I Know that when I think about what freedom is that its course and not only the essence of oppression but the presence of justice enjoy that we can get rid of all the bad things and that doesn't mean that the good things automatically come into the air we have to fight for those\nSo that was where the other side of freedom came from it in the case for hope is that I think the hope is if you will for all of this hope is a belief that are tomorrow's can be better than that today's and when people say the system is broken and then in response and people say oh no it was designed to be like this my takeaway is that it was designed because people made it up we can make something better and that is the work of hope\nThere are a lot of questions that our listeners wanted to put to you about the work that you're doing about the black lives matter movement and so on I definitely want to ask you about today's political scene but before we dive into\nAll of that I'm just kind of curious to know how you are [laughter] you've been a very busy due to the last four years how are you how is life treating you\nKnow I'm OK it's a ... I I Do a lot of interviews and nobody ever asked me that so I appreciate that [laughter] I'm good I think that like I'm a I'm a\nSupport for NPR comes from this station\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from bona with the bone a certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractors committed to expertise and customer service\nContract to locate her and more information or at bona dot com\nAnd from ... committed to changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every\nDay in nine hundred franchise locations matinees him dot com slash NPR\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson we are speaking to dream of catching the host of the podcast pod save the people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope\nOne by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching helped lay the groundwork for activism\nOh you know it's funny I like don't can myself is very old but I taught a decade ago my my students the students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild uh\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because he was urging everyday like every single day to show up and I talked to scream at every single they had to show up in our math to my students had to be as prepared and I taught sixteen Ninety a hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lot of math or anybody who's ever hang around eleven year old\nUh what I learned there are a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into\nPieces that are can be consumed and can be repeated back so my skill was like what I learned was not only how to like get kids to understand like when the crazy ones but like I did teach discreet skills like you know into things tattooed sometimes means multiplication right that like\nLike you know into things touch it sometimes means multiplication right that like to take apart these big things to make them bite size and then have students to be able to play with them in a way that they could put them back and rearrange on their on their own or the second was like really understanding like what it means to\nLike do work that will have an immediate impact but we'll have a long term impacts so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative numbers they struggle they like they can get it like anything lower than zero that like I don't get it by the end they can fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it\nAnd that was like understanding like the arc of how to build capacity and like I learned that the third thing is I think the best teachers but the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got there\nAnd that like I work is to help\nStudents understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone with the worse teachers do is walk in the classrooms and make people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think in such a corollary to organizing that when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community\nThat like what I'm trying to do is help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know they might not believe they might not know how to use them and what I can do is help them find them and then use them long after we're gone\nLet's get some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct\nTV with his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people know the names of the three black women who actually started B. L. M. thing Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps\nPatrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nCertainly think that the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book that\nI you know for those of us who are industry in Ferguson we're mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protest there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organized everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nUh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember that we're in the street for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which I'm fortunate that there's this narrative that if that has come up that as a race so many people\nThat suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized every body the organizations did that work and that's just simply not true someone I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nThat I'm awful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protest or so that is important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exists for me that\nUh one of the important things about having the platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people homes have sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names\nAnd in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street\nAbout those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together but this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like what the catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certain leaders have become more prominent\nWith the concern about but who profits off to cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast as a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nIs it's interesting I think I'm always shut eye you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked I'm I some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end of ... a portion of all the pre order sales went to the N. double ACP legal Defense Fund that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book raised to like that tightening of the books as typically\nBut in general in the face like I'm mindful of this ... when we started campaign zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is not a lot of money and the grand scheme of non profit than we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we thought was important right so we created the first oh the database of police union contracts at first it public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really disagree projects\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not pay you know I'm a salary from the stuff so we try to do it is like\nWith just the bare necessities so that it's not just a question of like profit\nUh in with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton be a part of it they get paid as a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense um\nAnd it's not like some you know huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to rely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well ah\nAnd you know it's like I ... the way that I exist in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like a [laughter] not only does not and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like it was a really rough um it was rough\nOnly this only a couple of months ago and the first time I've actually lived alone since the protests have essentially been thing in the basement of a like my second parents after the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us as you know wants to get married in the in the basement of their right second parents that's not sustainable some ... but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like there are these narratives of like\nWork right now right that like there are these narratives of like oh I made it gets ill in dollars and it's like well now you see me on the news you hear in a pod cast you like see me at a an event that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case that I've had high incomes before and you know that that there was any income and wealth is pretty significant though\nI'm so people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about policing one of the members of the one eight text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and a free pass in our courts and society\nContrast that with another tax club or who wrote as time goes on society will bring about necessary reform but to denigrate and disregard the entire police force as an institution is ludicrous\nWhat do you think he I think you know I think for ...\nFor two thousand years we slit people's arresting call their health care we literally drained people's blood down and we were like ... it's going to drain out all the impurities and people were like oh they their blood pressure they changed it's like no they didn't have any blood right like that actually isn't a solution but we did it for two thousand years it was one of the most popular medical procedures\nBut it didn't work so if the goal was that the people's lives it's like actually wasn't a good thing\nOr if the goal was to like pretend that you were doing good then like this was excellent and I think about policing it's like if the goal is to stop crime or like to to do any of that work like it just isn't whether how no matter how you feel about the police that just isn't happening so you look at the clearance rates and violent crime all across the country\nDeparture NPR comes from\nSupport for NPR comes from the

hope let's talk about some of the more personal aspects of your life that you describe in the book there's a short section in the book\nLike page and a half were you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write code I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remembered joy and try outs\nWhen we remember pain we're trying to protect ourselves and cope we're trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote talk about how those kinds of\nTraumatic or difficult experiences as a kid kind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who gravitate toward active as\nKnow it's interesting ah this is the first time I'm saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um [noise] and she texted me recently and it was I hate to re read the book we should talk [noise] and I just haven't had a cabin\nWe should talk um and I just have it at a Kevin I'm with right back it so hopefully I'll write facts to\nEase one of the reasons why I wrote this chapter in the ... I can remember and now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave than it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within and grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize has had like we're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are I'm part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it uh the the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr any other aspect of their dignity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew would pass one when not to ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside you know there are a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up\nAnd sometimes we still only see a world of constraints said like the constraints become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive that we can start to imagine things beyond and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd like you think about the diversity in the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for a new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe that you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that\nYou've never seen a world where every woman at the right to choose but like we believe that that's real and like telling those stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you into the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times in a rather young age\nAnd you connect that was what you call the client quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the client instead of the closet because I've never eaten any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons that important for me to be out very very\nUm [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very ... way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gate to think that the only way\nTo do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it was the Rio Grande like I was in the quiet and not the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room as a black man and like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected within social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about a mile an identity\nThat we need to do without talking about a mile an identity now I wrote about the uh the sexual assault because it was re oh it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know um but it was like sort of\nIt with ... in some ways to finally just stay and like not have to tiptoe around it and not be ashamed to say that this happened and and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally taught a couple of years later they realized that he'd actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me um\nTo like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book because I like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were appeared and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right as I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlets actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my own air career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people\nAre OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception do you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full I did a ...\nMine in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know let's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my that even they have to be you know you know like\n... I think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike is not one way right that there's not two ways to be gay they're like the pride parade is really really all\nThat like yeah so like sometimes it is me wearing rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is me just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues is publicly as possible and like you know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life too I live so that like other people can feel like it's real re so like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now to try to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people and people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of their results but that are\nThat they are actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns and they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cause and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like what privacy really be private right and that like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I've I don't feel like I Need to talk about the every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right\nSo the other thing I'll say that there's some people who like a really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your ...\nWith all that but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your eight\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bed for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling me a sellout unquote I Wonder how you are finding your way forward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so any way you are part of a media so to speak\nAnd reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism word that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were\nYou know it's like a both and the rate that like you know what's interesting is that all those people who who commit thought for for quote participating in the system and those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell everybody to vote who tell people not to vote in twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics to matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary in the Washington Post and people literally there were like you're wasting your employment I Can't believe you did that like president doesn't have any bearing this is just for show and it's like\nNobody is saying that now that is that ... that was a wild statement of the day and it's wild to say today so I think that people got a I it's unfortunate that like people getting it took all of the chaos that that the president continues to\nTo put in the face and you think about even there are a lot of really really public people and movements aides who literally just would not say anything about Hillary that wasn't she was a monster and like you don't have to agree with all the Hillary stuff to know that like she was\nIt takes a lot to make a TV show succeed\nA clock it takes a lot to make a TV show sixteen sometimes you need crazy new ideas and sometimes going old school makes the difference between some of the people who make it work [noise]\nFrom W.

Blacksburg he's the show runner of Netflix bow jak horsemen it just released its entire fifth season for streaming and I've watched just about all of that fifth season a rough it let's talk about season five\nRight let's get into it [laughter] it's getting dirty a big amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner himself but there's a line out actually something along the lines of television as a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I have to say a when that line came up at the table read it got much bigger laugh when I was expecting from the crowd of people\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner on a press to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be unimpressed or talking about a ... a little bit\nIt's it's strange and you know one of the things we wanted to talk about when and putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so\nUm and it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius who you know a touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just\nYou know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people making a better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by ... they had all the uh director is bring so much to the episodes of the the story born animators the editors\nBring so much to the episodes of the story board animators the editors um it it it\nReally it takes a village um so it's odd that yes I'm doing all these interviews now and talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not have a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone who presents that as how a TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word play the slapstick puns and the ... falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes for him\nIt's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers who we can't help and make it funny\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously um you know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and this guy's talking octopus\nOr [laughter] you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here are but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals I'm so [laughter] this story is quite serious\nAh but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it\nIs is we're telling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adults as Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in ...\nTo whom do you think you owe your origins in television who do you see is your former [laughter]\nUm oh you mean by influencing yeah where do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show no I mean\nThe shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them the shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American Audi\nWell I I think you know the obviously the the giants as The Simpsons and I think it would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me\nOr my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of the Simpson um but also when I was pitching the show\nI I really wanted it to exist outside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I said ah we're going to ... when we start season one you're going to watch it and the first is going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park\nBut then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men um and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the\nUm and to really take things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah we'll our net as Beau jak and he said they're incredible princes Carolyn the sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat uh Internet a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there\nSir cat uh Internet a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some point um\nSee them as one of the first people we cast [laughter]\nAnd he was cast her whale\nAs a newscaster well uh we we had in the script you um you know a guy or a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Lynda Lamont and said I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role and really and we call them like yeah it sounds like fun um and he's fantastic we keep bringing it back season after season\nAnd you know one of my ah first memories of making the show and realizing how fun it was going to be was\nWe had Keith on the phone from New York and we had him do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some we'll noises and you know this is Keith Olbermann who I was a very serious man are goofing around going [noise]\nYou know making whale noises I thought this would be a fun show I think well one of your other\nMain characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison Aubrey who is phenomenal now you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Alison breeze Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American is in the show now this season that's changed Diane does take a trip\nTo the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it well\nWe cast Alison ah in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast and we've been working a with a different actress um who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was uh\nDrop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issues so she couldn't be lead on our show any more um and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing uh just under a a great job ever since\nUm but more and more uh as I was looking around at at the cast and and thinking about\nYou know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast\nIt started to dawn on me that everyone in our house was white and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this was an unintentional thing uh that I was doing as\nA racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were casting his characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is like I Need to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices\nOr try to have more people of color on the show but when it comes to Dianne specifically um you know I think there is a a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles\nAnd I was not a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently as casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character and you know as I said in these other interviews\nUm I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness has prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it felt like this is a mistake we made\nAnd if I can just you know avoid it or you know glide passed it then you know maybe this won't become an issue where this you know won't become the thing that I ended up talking about in every interview and I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up\nAnd I I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up you know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as of race didn't matter\nIt's it's difficult but our show because in some ways race doesn't matter\nBecause there was also talking ... and you know in theaters and giraffes walking around so it's hard to say how was an Asian American humans experience that different from a white American humans experience but I I think there are differences and I'm more interested in exploring them now and I feel like\nThe uh\nAvoidance of the issue was holding us back narrative way well instead of avoiding it then you took responsibility for it on your own initiative and and as I said in season five\nFor NPR comes from this station and from farmers insurance

member more than any other\nThe cue card holder\nNYC cue cards handles all the cue hard work in New York a decidedly low tech job but some productions refused to do without joining us from NPR in New York is the owner of NYC cue cards while the fairest him\n... is the owner of NYC cue cards Wally fairest and he's worked three decades behind the scenes on shows including Saturday Night live while the fairest and welcome to one a\nAh thanks for having me Joshua thanks for and it's great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business a while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer I majored in writing\nAnd moved to New York in a you know my brother was working at CERN eleven times receptionist and ah they knew that you can't guy so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible and ah ah I got the job and I did I did it just kept my foot in the door and to make writing connections\nAnd uh you know I did I did make some money connections that I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept under the cue cards and I got really good at doing ... very quickly\nAnd ah you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I own my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lotta shows\nSo clearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nYou know I don't know I think one specially on Saturday Night live the live aspect of it and being out there you know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera\nA and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows and through this hard show that the you know they'd probably a lot of them have never done live T before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure of the changes and all the stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and uh you know I rose up pretty quickly in the ranks\nTell us about your company what shows does your company do cue cards\nFor uh the ... are four main shows that are that are that\nFor uh the ... are four main shows that are that are that tape all year our Saturday Night live\nUm the Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are four main shows um and then we will do some reality shows we do a master we do all the Project Runway as they shoot\nAnd then we do to show any show that comes to that town that he's ... guards you know work on that as well\nWhat kinds of people do well at this line of work\nThe first thing we look for is neat printing\nNow my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school ... years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of printing I at the cue cards I've seen are all written in all caps\nYes correct It's you know it's it's a this is it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about the spacing between ... between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the spacing between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody off the street and say okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train them for like two or three weeks\nI'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn\nUm two or three weeks of training yeah it it 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you could just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just interview scrape okay these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized than during whereas where how to end the card a car accident on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not\nShould end on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it flows the next car and just so many different rules where you can only learn it by by doing it in practicing it\nWe're speaking to Wally fairest and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York\nOkay so let's say you're working for me for you know the late night with Joshua Johnson right and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me\nAll right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight\nOr near sighted or glasses okay so you were a glasses will your glasses on the show where you were contacts or you're not were either I don't really like contacts hourglasses okay so you want your glasses so you can see fight I Want to have to if you didn't wear your glasses and you didn't want to wear contacts I could put your letters bigger so that you can see but that would also make less words and the card\nAnd it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're taught especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I wouldn't recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to say you're gonna wear glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we would we would have hearses ride would practice with you if you've never read cue cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away because that'll that'll look like you're reading the cue cards but how do you mean it looked as rapidly as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your band leader and I had cue cards\nSketch with your band leader and I had cue cards near the bandleader a position to the way that you would want to play to those cue cards now if you are looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the car to the bed later the audience would be like oh he's we obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those cue cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the camera so yeah so I'll I we won't be depending on where you are in position to the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right side so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nShow your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction to the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right especially was Saturday Night live that's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches and I'll be out there was one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put\nThe cards and I work with the director the stage managers wild well kind of confirmed and I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they needed extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical work week at SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously until eleven thirty five PM\nI Wish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday we start our house was on Thursday and Thursdays a light day so the music the musical group ... for the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon\nFor the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only print one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more\nAnd it it'll change from Thursday the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely rewritten from Thursday and friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process we print but then on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it ... the cards so it makes sense and then we I mean that we do that we don't have the we don't have the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the friday sketches because Saturday show day\nSo everything's printed I have about eight people there on friday just yeah basically writing all day I have to find job I'm Out on a set blocking working with the actress having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock to sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you ... you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or do you have like veteran cue card writers working for there's a little bit\nOf both um mostly um\nPeople that are trying to get it for them to and I encourage that I I Try to tell them cue cards is not a career I I did make it a career for myself\nBut there's not much room if you want to do it great for your lives that's awesome but you should be looking to do something else I'm encouraging them I'm helping them I'm introduced them to people that want they than in a career that they want to do mostly most of it's entertainment related but yeah\nWant to do mostly most of it's entertainment related but yeah you sit those long days or friday but that leads to Saturday where ever heard that they may come out from behind the scenes and there are some with me 'cause I Can't I Can't hold for sketches at one time you know four sets of cars at one time so I Need other people out there and then that's kind of the fun part of it\nHow close up to Showtime see for Saturday Night live how close are you writing after Showtime\nWe don't stop making changes usually until ... sometimes twelve thirty at night ... night while the show's going on\nSo you could still be writing while you're alive\nOr we are we definitely
