for the midterms\nMuch more than what's happening with Senator Elizabeth Warren and President Trump their ongoing feud over Warren claiming to have tribal ancestry the senator has addressed her heritage in the past including at this year's National Congress of American Indians\nGet why some people think there's hate to be made here you won't find my family members on any rules and I'm not enrolled in a tried and I want to make something clear\nI respect that distinction I understand that tribal membership is determined by tribes and only by tribes but my mother's family was\nOnly by trying my mother's family was part Native American and my daddy's parents were bitterly opposed to their relationship\nNow in the scheme of things doesn't matter if Senator Warren really is a verifiable tribal heritage clearly it does to her especially after the president referred to her as Pocahontas and said he would give a million dollars to the charity of her choice if she could prove or ancestry\nThat apparently led to senator to take a DNA test who's results she says prove that she is Cherokee\nThat drew criticism from tribal leaders like the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior who spoke on MORNING edition\nUm and then we are now at the point where she has taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nMeans by which you are a turkey citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA are really undermines tribal interest frankly\nOn top of that the test did nothing to stop the presidents insults he tweeted quote\nPocahontas the bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth\nFar less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her quote DNA test is useless even they don't want her\nPhoney and quote\nWhat is the story actually means for Native Americans

Bennett citizen and Terry levine a senior reporter for the center for Public Integrity\nWe heard from quite a few of you who shared your stories about exploring your tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nJoshua this is Carol Everly a I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot\nBox Hi Sheila this is Carol elaborately uh I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to us that we were part of the ... tribe in Oklahoma we applied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted\nAnd it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um we can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us mark ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back um ah through time\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community has one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important ... one of the things I Love to think about is a shoney's was hundred mastodon hunted mastodon hunted messed it I think about that long arc\nYes I I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back\nMillennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture are there other kinds of benefits that you find whether their intrinsic or extra benefits of being an acknowledge member of a tribe that are worth protecting that are worth keeping in there\nTry that are worth protecting that are worth keeping in their proper places I mean Carol talks about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being and acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it is incumbent upon us to protect our our our children are native languages are traditions are land the water\nAnd the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA tests is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native\nYou know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it\nThey take our language and they can modify it they take our spirituality and modify it and they make money\nThey make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of their family lore or they speak with some smog in title meant\nLike they've lived the life of a native like somebody's ever called them an engine or a our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies at the door even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nI should know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kids the ones that say find out your ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October seventeenth we did it on October Eighteenth\nOf last year called ... where do we come from we spoke to a geneticist are named Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about what DNA can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you were going to do one of these ...\nAnd what you actually need to know if you were going to do one of these home DNA test you'll find that conversation with Adam referred on our website the one a dot org that's the word the the number one daughter a dot org Brittany tweeted I Am a ... ... or mohawk\nAnd I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help native issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nYou a progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focus on this\nProgressive she must have known why we both Kerry living because we're going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you ate progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell\nNorth Dakota has\nA voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court decided to essentially let it go into effect for the November election so what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who is one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger\nPause have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve setting the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had\nA very strong support from three counties in North Dakota\nShe had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American and so this voter id law\nCould potentially fall heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed it because they said that that north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nSo what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box is they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient\nSo if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that I Do you use in the primary is no longer good for the general\nElection a lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by her supporters\nAs an effort to root out voter fraud has been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about is a measure to prevent voter fraud and also\nBecause the the state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even it'd vertically vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast a ballot and the wrong precinct would this would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if your mailing address the somewhere different than where you actually\nDirectly cast if you're a mailing address the somewhere different than where you actually reside would\nLove to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population there reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether you are in North Dakota or elsewhere love to hear from you if you're in North Dakota but email is one a at W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one eight or comment on our Facebook page\nCary what did you hear from people in North Dakota about how this law as affecting them is this on people's radar is is kind of more of a a smaller issue I'd say it is and also you have to put it against the larger contact I'm Sorry you see it as it is a is a big issue or does this ... oh I think\nIt's really on people's radar absolutely an issue and I also think there's some context around it when I was reporting from North Dakota from the Standing Rock reservation which is in North and South Dakota but the north Dakota part is affected by this\nUm ... you know really one of the things that I was interested in one of the reasons I went there even before the Supreme Court ruling is because voter turnout there is the lowest in the state\n... it was the lowest in the state before this and that's because there are challenges that people their face and getting to the polls so I I think you have this law now becoming a new complication for this election that has the potential to drive turnout even lower and you have people reacting to that their their\nExcuse me their tribal governments and nonprofits that are taking steps\nTo try and help people get residential address as if they need them assigned trying to make sure that they can obtain id\nLooking to mobilize voters and five\nThey can obtain id and looking to mobilize voters and find ways to get them to the polls whether those efforts will be successful given a short time frame I I don't think that's clear yet but I think you absolutely have a reaction to this sense that it's meant to suppress\nWhen I'm a guy support for NPR comes from this\nAnd my\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the Annenberg Foundation committed to supporting educating and engaging communities in the United states and globally for more than twenty five years learn more at Annenberg Foundation dot org\nFrom Americans for the arts committed to transforming America's communities through the arts and arts education supporting the nonprofit arts industry which employs four point six million people nationwide learn more at Americans for the arts dot org\nAnd from the any Casey foundation\nTomorrow we'll continue our conversation about the mid term elections with a national look at major races and issues we booked a great panel but we could use your help to focus the discussion what are your main questions and your main concerns about the midterms candidates polls voter turnout controversies or anything else\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a which we talk about tomorrow when we talk about the midterms on a national level it's eight five five to three six one two one two\nYou can also send us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop you can download the app that's V.

H. M. U. dot org\nThe medical I Wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked\nCasey Kendra tweeted what I Would like to see is all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over how much do you get\nWe need to start over how much do you get a sense that the pure polarization\nOf today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but\nIt is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off you\nKnow a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics in the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of it not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI Do in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about\nThe hardest core a people within the party but in fact we're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest or seeing high turnout in primaries in in special elections\nAnd you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a Pew sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder Juana Summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's\nThe the potential playbook for Democrats first of all ... context and focus on the house for example how many feet with the Democrats need to flip the house\nShirts that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks who work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home\nAnd I'm an off year or mid term here and there was a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color or Latinos African Americans and Asians who are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and ...\nIs there a certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout slide you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch gold at the Democratic party's aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan congressmen who chairs the Democratic democratic congressional campaign committee is they don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house\nOf turning the house blew but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue wave crashing over a pick up of some ten seats or something\nA huge blue wave crashing over a pack of some ten seats or something like that they're focused on delivering that twenty three out turning the house bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a a balance of power right now Republicans control every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue way was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to be pumped again\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling what are some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a to run Congress ... the Democrat in your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public falling a shown it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take the at least that was twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when I was gamed out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive despite all the talk of Kavanaugh you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive lands\nSeventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats win half of those that's the house\n[noise] glad to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about the midterms including about the nature of polling in general are doing the God love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with the elections with not having enough holes in down ballot races even even U.S House by state house and stuff because\nIf it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat at least at the federal and state level but if it's a Jew in that I Want to follow a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own name so I Need to know if the raiders coach or not if it's a if it's true it if my vote might be the deciding vote and I need all I Need some polls July to divide and it it actually changes my boat the poll change my vote\nEllen thanks for your comment Dominican that cracks me up or if he wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience than he should do so\nI get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate\nAnd lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page\nPlease discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with the horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on poles when such reporting could affect turnout our elections are not sporting events\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen\n[noise] yeah I mean I you know look I mean this is the this is a tried and true a criticism um you know we can get into the science of polling and whatnot and I would disagree that were obsessed quote unquote with polling we do use it to pepper our coverage and to give us a sense of\nAh what the snap shots are within districts in fact I'm far more interested in trends in polls rather than poll to pull horse race I think that's a not a good way to look at the polling ah I think that uh again overall trends and you know issues and questions\nOf giving you a sense of a kind of a temperature read of people is way more useful\nShould note earlier this year back in February we did a whole hour on the nature of political polling Dominican was part of the panel you can listen to that program which we called can we trust polls on our website just search for it on line at the one a dot org that's the word ... the number one letter a dot\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with a legacy of putting clients financial wellbeing first learned more at Raymond James dot com\nAnd from the science themes foundation since ninth\nAnd from the science Sims foundation since Nineteen eighty five supporting advances in science education and the arts towards a better more just society more information is available at size Sims foundation dot org\nBack now to our conversation with Juana Summers of the Associated Press Katie Sanders of politifact and NPR's the medical months and are all still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the mid term elections email us one a at W.

P. R. dot org let's get to some of your comments about the midterms Laurie emailed I Am a lifelong Democrat and I can tell you what frustrates me and has for years\nThe complete inability of the Dems to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democrat Party website and the front page does not see what they are for does not tell me what they care about one summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up\nTo the midterms how common is Laurie complaint and how well are Democrats doing an answering it\nI think the lord is pointing to is actually really comment and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how it affects that and number of the conversations I had I recently wrote an article about looks at how Democrats are trying to um make sure they have record mid term turnout and they said that when they're talking about her as are sending out mailers are going and knocking people's doors in these ...\nTalking to voters are sending out mailers are going and knocking the people's doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure\nThat they're telling their voters that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations are about just running against President Trump\nMay say um I was talking to some groups that did some field testing recently among Latino voters and they said ... and when they did this field testing\nThey were saying people were turned off is that if they got a ... a mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump's face on it they'd be super turned off right they throw that away they wouldn't even engage or see who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that match and you talk about what they can do for them what's at stake but that's\nThat's why you hear Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear about healthcare message I think has Dominican noted being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo medical I Wonder if we can follow up on the scene was one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what judge John left in our inbox\nIssued John ... Syracuse New York so often on the shows people for the Republicans the Democrats or Republicans the Democrats the Republicans would\nInstead of doing that they should be focusing on specific policies namely the Democrats that stand for such a threat to\nThe Republicans to them for such and such it helped educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just going Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stand for ... I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for\nI feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for X or the Democrats who have done ... to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's point that it just feels a little bit too broad\nBrush yeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where\nAre the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what\nPresident Obama did or regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example a by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party in twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans in how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties sand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this midterm\nKatie I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org listener writes with the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advised to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Cady\nOh I think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party as a as Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and it really sticks with people as much as people\nGoing going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and it really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do a it is memorable\nAnd it's certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here ... years [laughter] it's funny to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever\nThe medical literature on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers of women running a record numbers of el ... out L G G cue candidates running some of whom spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier\nGive us a sense of what that means for the midterms and whether many of these candidates are considered to send a strong chance of winning\nWell look you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think a lot of Native American candidates or you know just to New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is\nA an openly gay man or he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire the Democrat now\nBut when again we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected and when we talk about when the when I'm a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women\nWho have been nominated for ah for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three have been democratic women\nJust if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running ... that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven so I'm Sorry\nCombined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nSo I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers are basically saying that three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic woman who'd be nominated\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right and the the wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill areas have been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll\nAnd you know they are going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWanted there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between here and send them at the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican you know Arizona is going to have a female senator in that seat\nI Wonder how much you see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSure so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates a certainly more on the side of Democrats than Republicans I think that's frustrated and number of Republican women I spoke to two women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate\nYoung promising Republican conservative went in\nFrom the local those local level seats all the labs had nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's list a group that cultivate and backs a pro abortion rights when female candidates so there there is some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues that he actually\nSo there there's some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues that he actually asked\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell about that the question came in the back and forth about the Senate Judiciary committee and the lack of Republican women on that panel during the hearings around Dr ... Ford and justice Brett now justice Brett Kavanaugh and he's on them are like and why there were no women there Mitch McConnell said you know\nThat's something he doesn't like it something he wants to see more of but I still haven't heard Republicans\nForthrightly at least to me answer if this is such a problem if you want to see more women in the Senate on your side if you want to see more women moving up in the house and we should note that there is a woman and Republican leadership and Cathy McMorris Rodgers but where does lemon come from because\nAs we know running for office is very expensive it's very tough it's very tactical if you don't have help and you don't have an apparatus those people are never going to show up\nSpeaking of women Republican leadership to medical I I'm not sure if you've seen anybody running or campaigning talking about Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her decision to allow the Brett Kavanaugh confirmations for that long expedition she gave in the Senate floor that made a lot of people rather upset with her final decision I\nN.

hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs go yet by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reversed course and start becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that they're in lies the crunch glad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you\nLive with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management had been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential can't potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted a zillion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what is manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators associates\nYou'd have director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome thank you\nRyan can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture is we've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places are at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently that describes how over the last forty years\nGeographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a tax club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there is ...\nPrice for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nI think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity in the national data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers\nAnd we just haven't observe that you know overall real wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins are for example a wage growth in construction and manufacturing has not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions they're going a bit faster in New England in the Pacific states but ah but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that\nThey were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who worked for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nWas shell emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage thousands travel to Massachusetts daily or the pay is much better Christine in terms of what you're dealing with\nIt's the we were the pay is much better Christine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\nHer [noise] well I and I don't have any empirical data on why so many uh employees are working in math and traveling there that I Know when I Lived there that they reported over half a million or can eaters everyday into the city and out um and many of those are coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we have and to the jobs that are out there\nWhat do you see the roots about shortages Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\n... ah you know I I feel like you know my point of view is I'm going to sort of a wider industry perspective in in the sense that I worked in technology for the last ten years and\nComing to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high demand um occupation such as automotive construction manufacturing there just seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's in manufacturing or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about\nThe nature of will be described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed to all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester\nFight older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester they've been out of work for at least six months I've overheard conversations at my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen year olds ages them is a big problem ... how do you see this is the impact of\nOf older workers especially in in high tech careers especially in like Silicon Valley\nIt's becoming worrisome at this point where if you're old we just decided we don't want you\nYeah I think that's that here in New Hampshire it's kind of like a to a degree that's less of a problem than it may be in Silicon valley for example because if you don't\nIt runs through October twenty first details at Reno little theater dot org\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from capital one

our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers Chris writes\nAs a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want experienced people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voicemail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics and warehouse and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months\nAnd we are really struggling with two items one is employed turnover where there are chasing higher wages and a new facility is a new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and\nSecondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade jobs shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your abandoning your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to stem their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers\nTo the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAnd accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt\nThat plan was the idea of Randy ... the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to weigh\nThings Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\nAnd come home award program that we launched in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship and smiles on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarship to talk about and going down but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model and instead of investing heavily in it\nIn traditional scholarships of talk about and going down but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we've flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly a pot of completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work and it's really on home home reward\nPaying off of that so this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair county\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that if they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about Sinclair county pay me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of Lake Huron in St Clair river\nUm our largest town of port Huron has a population of about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did not have a fortune five hundred company in our region a thirty percent of our workforce leaves our county and heads down to metro Detroit to to be employed\nBut they love the small town life or the family friendly environment amenities are were small town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside of Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged\nOn the economic held the regions like port Huron are Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true how\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people they're pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come on the program was once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was philanthropies government business\nThat led to this come on program was once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was philanthropies government business\nAnd the other sector we realized that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan\nIt had to be an organic planned that drove our prosperity\nWe're speaking to Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair talented in St Clair accounting Michigan also still speaking to Russ T. Bo the president of applied economic research and Ryan non policy director of Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies\nAt the Brookings Institution still time to get in some more of your questions and thoughts about\nThe labor shortage won a at W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us ... when a or comments on our Facebook page where you can watch our video streams so Randy told me how the come home award work suppose I'm from saint Clair county and I moved to Chicago\nFor work and now I'm considering coming back how does that work\nYeah Chicago's a great example Chicago Austin's south um as long as you do not have primary residence here so let let's say your parents still live in this region maybe completed college six years ago\nAnd you're still living in Chicago but you met someone you met a party the medicine every other you're you're weighing the option of staying in Chicago which is a great place to live or you want to come back home settled down start a family spend more time doing what you want to do as long as you don't already live back in our region\nOr you're eligible for Fifteen thousand dollar award if you're selected we give the recipients a hundred and twenty days to establish a permanent residency or they have to find a job that they don't already have won several already have jobs lined up\nAnd then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as a carrot to keep you here in uh\nAnd then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as a carrot to keep you here and it's really a simple back on scholarship we pay the loan holder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo I Do so you you pay it out a little bit overtime so by over time by the time to two years or up\nSinclair county voted this program to come home award will have put in Fifteen thousand dollars towards one's Dan I'm guessing it's like would that be three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars like every six months or so and it adds up to Fifteen thousand over time\nThat's exactly it Josh when the goal you know I'm is to really give young people actually can be in their twenties or thirties or forties\nI'm the chance to go two or three years without making that nationally I Know you see data that says the average college student has thirty thousand dollars in debt I don't know where they're getting that data Josh because out of the fifty plus applications we received our average editor eighty thousand dollars\n... that that's a crippling amount of debt that's preventing people from living the American dream\nI can relate to that I'd finally paid off my private student loans I had to settle them it was [noise]\nOh God it was it was the most awful form of financial slavery I can possibly imagine and definitely like that's a whole other our where I Will I Will rebel you with my tearful story of dealing with Sally Mae before I I Know rusty but wants to jump in but before he does Randy I just want to\nAsk you about some of the perception issues that we discussed with regards to New Hampshire\nThere's this ... there is evidence that young people are moving to bigger cities in in large numbers you've talked a lot about this feels kind of small town America New Hampshire specifically conquered for sure definitely feels like small town America\nDo you think there's this misperception about smaller communities that young people\nThis misperception about smaller communities that young people are getting I haven't seen the TV show\nThat kind of glorified young people in a small town since dawson's creek I mean you don't see it much any more to do you think people are just getting the wrong idea about living and working in smaller parts of the country that we're all just kind of dazzled by the big city\nYou know that that's a great point I was when I speak around the country about this program in this effort uptown attraction there is a complete misperception that young people don't want to move to a small town America I'm One of the biggest impacts of this programming is dispelling that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Reno", "day": "18"}
