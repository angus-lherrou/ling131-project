and Shane Harris covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post good to have you back saying Hi from afar Joshua\nLet's begin with the weather which made big news this week you know it's been more than fifty years in the United states had a storm like hurricane Michael\nFlorida's panhandle bore the brunt of the damage that's where it made landfall many beachfront homes are in pieces some of them in splinters at best\nAnd the number of water rescues are under way more than a million power customers in Florida Georgia the Carolinas and Virginia are disconnected and the death toll has risen to at least Thirteen people\nThe administrator of FEMA Brock Long spoke\nPeople the administrator of FEMA Brock Long spoke to CNN's John Berman on new day what's the biggest challenge you and your teams are facing this morning for\nAccess you know access to all the areas is one thing a search and rescue is where we are hyper focus this morning\nA but as that uh you know simultaneously what we're trying to do is assessed roadways and bridges to make sure that we can get you know teams commodities and equipment into the areas that were hardest hit a hospital system or near Panama City in and around Panama City took a hit too so we we have to stabilize or the Cape and health and medical capabilities that are there\nAre over thirty thousand workers from around the United states had been pre stage to try to work as quickly as possible to get the power back on but here again it's all about access we got to get make sure that it's safe to travel down roadway quarters and get in there to uh start rebuilding the power grid which can take a a very long time at this point\nIt's FEMA administrator Brock Long speaking on CNN he also expressed some frustration with Floridians who did not mind the updates to the building codes which were updated in two thousand one pretty clear to see which homes were up to code and which were not you can tell which homes were up to code because they were still standing when Michael is gone\nTodd's we'll talk about the kind of pressure that FEMA is under with this recovery effort especially considering that these kinds of strong storms may well become more frequent in the near future a devastating storm huge sections you saw some of the drone\nCoverage or an aerial photos entire sections of Mexico beach in Florida essentially a raced I'm a devastating storm even if the death toll was not the horrible numbers that we\nA devastating storm even if the death toll is not the horrible numbers that we heard from

friday news roundup with political journalist Todd's will lick reporter Shane Harris of Washington Post and ... California report before we move on from the weather and climate really there was one more thing you want us to ...\nYeah I just wanted to lead to mention you know ... Rome or the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week uh talking about carbon taxes being the solution to to this crisis at least in part\nOn and you know I think it's important to just recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to attacks uh on carbon not only are you\nThat is if you commit to attacks uh on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of it because when money is at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAn economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business\nCalifornia's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality by twenty forty five which I'm sure sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to one of the policy prescriptions the I the IPC set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it really in trouble for a very serious about doing it\nIt's a very serious about doing it um you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus 'em and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political will not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada same thing there you have prime minister Justin Trudeau trying to in a\nAnd pose a a carbon tax across the country and he's running into real opposition at the provincial level there\nWe move on let me get one more comment from your comments on this not my autonomy tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change\nA good point I wanted to call me I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not question the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying [noise]\nLeary tweeted it's frustrating because your criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people\nStay in hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand I disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you heart in your home and if you want to live in Florida that his he base will risk of living within ... yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there you just have to absorb that\nOn the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall had to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the town cannot incorporate it's it's it's a tough one\nNobody's really tough and when we're when we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year are tied and I were just talking about the strength to break\n'em there are existential risks that are opposed not just to a community is close to the coastline to where we are talking about today but large cities like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurvive ability about resilience but whether people want to continue living there\nAnd there is an element of risk that you take for that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change\nIs a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... ... one small point just to and if you think that that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about uh Americans also\nIs something we need to think about uh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisors had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nWill listen for those who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish you of course a speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going\nWhat your thoughts are and how things are going how well FEMA is meeting

Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance to grill\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on this face to face um how much intervention did the White House do in this says supplemental background check\nWill also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up so she's up for reelection you can bet that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd last thing I'll say it she just last night um with trying to take the fight from you know on the SCOTUS thing too\nThat the way that Trump is trying to remake the courts writ large\nTo that the way that they're trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court hearing California contamination this is a court that's been a real store on ... side the White House just put forth as three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on that and she's very upset about that and Trump\nAt ... really breaking friend tradition by not getting the home state senators any say in these packs\nI Do want to see if we can leave time to talk California politics before the roundup is up but a few more things to DC we wanted to discuss including the president stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just missed swift\nFor ... to Democrats in Tennessee and he walk 'em Kanye West of the White House yesterday Connie wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd we're going to lunch you were going to do a lot of fun but I don't want to say I don't want to put you in this dog off by love this guy let me give this guy\nNow Connie West was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear those Shane Harris Kanye seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he noted that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to market\nDig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of easy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the resolute desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I I think it was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to dig through these deep and there's like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of said is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA a when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not\nThat surprising but I think for a lot of people there's a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling\nBizarre what do we make it a behavior from a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but there's also left many people scratching has had about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him a it was just a very strange moment and I know for\nFor for for me and my colleagues who just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving past as quickly as we could do that too but I should note the county's old nemesis Taylor Swift and sort of herself into politics this week she endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media the Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British and has\nShe'll media the Senate race in Tennessee is tight and Britain has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand after her post\nShane Harris let me stick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... Saudi dissident and a resident of the U.S he disappeared inside the Saudi consulate\nIn Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically ... hit men to kill ... to show you because of his reporting\nThe Turkish government hasn't really provided any independent evidence for this they say they have security video and and and logs and people who signed in and so forth what do we actually know right now if anything about what really happened right well\nRight now is largely coming from the Turks and Turkish security agencies\nAre what we reported last night my colleagues and I and the Post's late last night was at the Turks have told the Americans that they actually have audio recordings and video from inside the consulate that they say definitively prove such a ... who was an opinion writer for the post Washington Post\nA was a beaten tortured and killed and ultimately dismembered inside\nThat facility um the Americans and we understand have not seen the footage or hurt it themselves but there is a growing believe within the U.S intelligence community and I think within Congress and the White House ah that the Saudis probably did kill Jamal ... and are not at all being forthcoming about that\nJamal ... and are not at all being forthcoming about that this is a politically\nDifficult situation for this president in particular because the White House is so close to uh the the regime and Saudi Arabia of Jared Kushner the president's son in law and senior advisors actually very personally close to a man named Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince\nOf Saudi Arabia and I broke a story earlier this week that before ... showed you went missing been so mom had actually ordered an operation to trying to lure him back", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "13"}
