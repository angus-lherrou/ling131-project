Illinois rights have enough and\nThere's nothing to hide we should be open to any possibilities\nYou know David I appreciate you Conan thanks very much and that was the question that Dick Durbin of Illinois put to Brett Kavanaugh and he paused for a long time and then Chuck Grassley who's the chairman of the committee a Republican chairman of the committee jump back in and then after that Rachel Mitchell the question or for the G O P basically lost her job and then the GOP senator started jumping back and\nLet me get to some more of your comments David thanks very much for talking to us Catherine emailed\nAs a woman listening to Kavanaugh defend himself last Thursday I didn't find his presentation appropriate\nIt smacks of bullying and intimidation aside from that conspiracy theories like revenge from the Clintons aired and Senate testimony is a major disqualify or in my eyes before we bring in our next guest professor fitzpatrick if I can ask you to respond\nTo Catherine particularly whether or not someone who began by making a partisan broadside can be trusted to sit on the Supreme Court and administer equal justice under law\nWell I'm you know I think we have to be realistic about all of this are\nThink we have to be realistic about all of this our Supreme Court justices come from the political world they work for president of one party and I'm often times or they have other experience in politics they are\nTo some extent partisan or in their outlook but they try\nTo put that to the side as best they can when they get on the court\nAnd focus on the statutes the constitution the administrative regulations and I think they do a pretty good job obviously people's world view influences their decisions to some extent but\nI think we'll find that if judge Kavanaugh's confirmed\nHe is a successful just as well liked by his colleagues just like Clarence Thomas\nFrankly a is today if you ask the justices if they like Clarence Thomas they they they will tell you I don't dislike him I Love him so Sonia Sotomayor came to Vanderbilt\nLast year and talk to her students and she said that I Love Clarence Thomas and so I think we'll get beyond this um but they're certainly going to be some awkward moments for a year or two [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to our conversation joining us now in Studio is Elizabeth why drop the president of the constitutional accountability center a public interest law firm as think tank based here in D.C Elizabeth welcome ... let me start with the question that I began with\nFor professors Rosen and fitzpatrick just your general sense of the hearing both the structure of it and the testimonies we heard from professor Ford and judge Kavanaugh and how that might affect the ultimate\nAnd judge Kavanaugh but how that might affect the ultimate decision about whether Brett Kavanaugh should become an associate justice of the United states\nWell I think you know harkening back to what the caller uh just uh your your um listener just mentioned about the\nPresentation that judge Kavanaugh made and talking about revenge of the Clintons you know there's definitely been a divide between those who are centering Dr Ford and the other survivors of sexual assault and as we saw on judge Kavanaugh's opening censoring the political\nTalking about the Democrats talking about uh whether or not they should have leaked her letter and disregarded her request for anonymity you know I think that ah whether or not you think Senator Feinstein should have\nTried to raise this another way earlier she was trying to respect the clear request for anonymity from this\nTraumatized survivor and maybe it's telling that Republicans would have just leaked it anyway and disregarded her request but Senator Feinstein was trying to give her the respect that she and her experience deserved and I think that trying to\nMake this part of a political gain game like she came up with this decades long ... on to try to stop judge Kavanaugh from getting to the Supreme Court is frankly offensive it's offensive to\nHer and her experience and to the many many many many others who have experienced sexual assault and have not come forward because of fear because of shame because they worried frankly that what we might\nIt's a shame because they worried frankly that what we might see in this case would be true for them that they would finally find their voice and the courage to come forward and it would not matter\nI Wonder Elizabeth if there was any way around the politicking of this if it was just bound to happen no matter what I mean we got a lot of comments very critical of the Democrats alluding to what you just kind of reference there have emailed the Democrats are showing the ugly side and the people see right through their deception they should be ashamed but\nThat would require morals which they lack and Joe emailed I'm a moderate conservative as are most of my friends we've discussed the Kavanaugh hearings and Democratic senators behavior extensively if the Democrats think their behavior will go unanswered I'm afraid they're mistaken this entire process needs to be overhauled\nWell I think that most people would agree that the nominations process for the courts both the lower courts and the Supreme Court is broken and you know it it's it's certainly a problem but I think that that's kind of a dodge you know okay let's talk about that\nBut let's first talk about Dr Ford and her very credible testimony and allegations and what it means for judge Kavanaugh getting a job promotion to the Supreme Court I think it's very important to note this is not a criminal trial no one is at this point trying to hold him criminally liable\nSo it isn't a beyond a reasonable doubt kind of thing it said let's try to get all the facts which is what the FBI investigation should be doing and I think we'll get to that uh soon um and then decide whether or not this is someone among other possible candidates who should be elevated\nCenter all the details and you an R. dot edu slash English\nMm\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of

Democrats are promising that if Kavanaugh is confirmed and they take the house they will hold impeachment hearings on the alleged misstatements in the confirmation hearings and they range not only from\nA his testimony involving Dr Ford and his college classmates insistence that he was a heavy drinker even though he says he wasn't and so forth but also about alleged misstatements and the first part of the hearings where he said he didn't know about a emails involving lower court confirmations or surveillance ... programs and the evidence tested he did\nSo regardless of whether the Senate chooses to decide that a small misstatement as evidence of a larger one the Democrats are determined to press these and they're not going to go away\nAnd to press these and they're not going to go way\nWho is your mom but tweeted sometimes the partisan lens is overrated I Am a moderate Republican women and so many women that I have known experience to solve like Dr for describes a friend from my church a high school friend a cousin a neighbor we believe her because we have been her\nPamela tweeted this is an impossible situation I feel deeply sorry for Ford is she was obviously sexually assaulted by someone and they spent her life trying to get over it I also feel deeply for Kavanaugh as I have a father and brothers there was no way to prove his guilt or innocence\nI should also note that we've been getting a number of voice mails and messages about this from across the country and even from around the world already in Hamburg, Germany left this note in our inbox\nThe Kavanaugh hearings have caught the attention of the German press beat to sue ... what do you decide the opinion though is uniform it's an\nAbsolute shock at the lack of respect being shown by the Republican Senate toward the Supreme Court and its own history as the world's greatest deliberative body the shock is not at the partisan tones and the hearing the right left battles are left right battles happening here too\nBut what's shocking is the tenor with which the Republicans have been speaking to the Democratic colleagues and the tenor with which the nominee himself used to address the Democratic senators Thursday\nAlready thanks very much for commenting to us in just by way of context to ... is a major paper in Germany if you remember our conversations about the Panama\nIf you remember our conversations about the Panama Papers the big international investigative report about money hidden in offshore bank accounts to do is I took was one of the major papers that helped drive that forward I Wonder a professor for Patrick what's your take is on what all of this means\nFor just America's image around the world how the world is reflecting on us because of the way we're handling\nThis well after last presidential election and I'm not sure image can get any worse um but uh you know I I think that it it is a shame that the judicial nomination process has become so broken parties and\nUm and you know the Republicans are just as much to blame if the Democrats what they did to Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia passed away was unconscionable in my view and I frankly don't blame the Democrats\nFor retaliating um with this nominee are and what so uh I really think that in in order to make the system\nWorks better we're gonna have to come up with some major overhaul and and I think the one solution\nTo kind of restore the dignity or judicial confirmation process is it's a big change but I think it's necessary change I think we have to ask do we think Supreme Court justices should have life tenure\nIf they didn't have served forty years it wouldn't be Armageddon every time someone retires and there's a replacement if presidents had a knowledge that every two years they get a Supreme Court nomination we would normalized this process and it would be\n... this process and it would become more I'm sane [laughter] I'm In law professors have been proposing this Eighteen year term for Supreme Court justices\nYeah time give her I've I've I've heard it was was I was just gonna ask you about that I've heard that suggested that if it was Eighteen years you know there are nine seats and you know every two years basically if he would come open kind of like clockwork\nThat this might not be quite so much like oh we're making this decision that one of our and our children and our children's children it would still be a big deal but you know Eighteen is less than thirty or forty the question is whether or not that's politically viable\nI Wonder if that just depends on whether we American people are willing to pound the table and demanded until the law changes if not impossible to change the law it's just difficult but what what are you\nYeah I mean I think that's probably going to be an unlikely a\nProposal for the particular Senate ah right now um but you know I think that this isn't just about the Supreme Court in life tenure because\nI think it's about this particular nominee I don't see the issues around Brett Kavanaugh as being a case of quote unquote retaliation from the Democrats you know there are a lot of issues with this particular nomination and in addition to the fact that he would be taking over Anthony Kennedy's\nSeat on the Supreme Court Kennedy being the vote that basically has preserved meaningful access to abortion preserved major civil rights and protections and so on and so on you know\nFive K. and sees the L go on the Web K.

U. dot org Richard by the way before we keep going we mentioned that you are a former lobbyist for the at our age you're not president of a group called the independent firearm owners association\nFor those who may not have heard of it that's that's a separate organization from NRA right or is it affiliated or is there any relationship no just clarify\nNo relationship between the two I headed up the firearm industry's trade association during the Nineteen nineties\nOkay thank you I just wanted to make sure we're kind of clear on on the the distinction between your organization and the and the n._r._a. Scott Greenberger I Wonder if we can talk a little bit more about red flag laws and their impact the Jerry Brown the governor of California the outgoing\nImpact the Jerry Brown the governor of California the outgoing four term governor of California\nJust vetoed a bill that would have expanded that states red flag law Jerry Brown is a Democrat very progressive but also thoroughly pragmatic and has pushed back on Democrats in an array of ways so\nThis is an unprecedented in terms of him vetoing something the Democrats would have wanted but what do you make of the veto\nWell a ... you know California of course is a very blue state of progressive state and already had um\nA a relatively speaking a pretty strong gun control laws in place so I'm at the Jerry Brown has a governed as a a pragmatic a liberal and progressive and so I'm\nA you know in this case he felt like it at perhaps you know with some of the concerns that ah Richard raise that uh it went a little too too far um and a richer note it's a question of of balance but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking a that a lot of the debate um\nPost a Parkland has focused on\nA these so called red flag laws or I'm\nA limiting the gun access to guns for people a domestic abusers you know the argument or the ... argument for for such a long time was that a\nGuns don't kill people people kill people and it seems that now rather than trying to revive a for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties\nOr people who are in favor of more um\nUh safeguards gun control are pushing on red flag laws are they're pushing on back\nAre pushing on red flag laws are they're pushing on background checks and it seems like that's a potential uh common ground between people who are\nA very strongly support their Second Amendment or what they view is their Second Amendment gun rights and and folks who would like uh some more controls and safeguards speaking\nOf the end are a governor Larry Hogan of Maryland who's Republican had an a minus rating from the national Rifle Association here he is endorsing a red flag law in this February\nI've said for years um that we need to do more\nTo keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill\nAnd people with criminal backgrounds that's why we will push for and support what is known as red flag legislation\nIn general this policy would allow family members for law enforcement to petition the court for a lethal violence protective order issued by judge which would prohibit in individual from having any firearms or ammunition\nIf the judge has clear evidence that the family member poses a an immediate and present danger um ah causing injury to themselves or daughters\nIndividuals with a mental illness should not have access to fire on period\nThat is Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland worth noting that his a minus rating from the n._r._a. dropped to a seat as a result of his support of these kinds of red flag laws Chris I Wonder what impact do you think that that kind of influence would have on more states passing these\nI Would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nI think it has a positive and packed up salute lay a and I think governor Hogan actually there are a he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician he has to be aware that that has an impact\nOn his NRA rating it has an impact on the rating the Brady gives them as well and I think it relates back to the initial point\nThat I made that is part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new slate of polls that have been taken\nWhich show in every state across this country a vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies a supporting exactly these kinds of measures\nThey're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures and they balance appropriately uh the you know the second Amendment rights of of gun owners with\nUh the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking components of mine job is getting polling data back and focus group information that really yields two different things and I think it's really important to think about these laws in this context first\nAmericans overall when they ask about their fear associated with being shot one of the most profound quotes I got back from a recent poll is well most people think I have not been shot yet\nAnd and that is a very concerning thing the second is many Americans are actually ashamed\nSecond is many Americans are actually ashamed\nAbout the epidemic of gun violence in this country and they want pragmatic solutions so I certainly applied governor Hogan for doing the right thing here but I think he like many politicians are looking at what their constituents want\nAnd moving forward knowing that these are popular and populist positions to take\nA here you Chris in terms of the pragmatic argument but you know when it comes to gun laws their constituents in their constituents I mean Vermont is a good example of that I mean ... was one of the states to ban bump stocks as part of a larger package of legislation on guns this year back in April Vermont governor Phil Scott who was a Republican who had an a rating from the n._r._a.\nSigned these laws in these bills into law\nNobody's got said he changed his mind about them after police\nFoiled an alleged shooter's plans to storm a local high school and basically kill as many people as possible now here is some of the sound from the signing ceremony as he was signing outside the Vermont state house he was being heckled by opponents to gun restrictions listen\nI support the second amendment [noise]\nAnd I\nAre\nDoing everything we can make our kids in our community safe\n[noise]\nWhere our kids are afraid to go to school and parents are afraid to put them on a bus\nOr police told them the tools they need to protect victims of violence or families can step in to prevent a ...\nThey need to protect victims of violence or families can step in different man a loved one [noise]\nPart of the signing ceremony on the steps of the Vermont state house with Vermont governor Phil Scott who is a Republican Richard Feldman Philbin when you hear that moment from the signing ceremony ... what does that tell you about the the nature of this debate in states across the country\nI think in many ways the pro gun community led by the national Rifle Association is somehow cornered itself by its own success\nOn the politics of this issue\nTranscends the policy\nOf this issue and therein lies so much of the problem in getting this debate focused in a way that we can achieve\nResults that work for everyone and we can but not when we focus on the politics but only on the policy we really have to align those two\nAnd dealing with the perceptions versus the realities in this society it's highly unlikely that anyone you or I Know directly is going to be shot\nIt's a statistical thing but of course it's gonna make news and we're all I'm In the same boat when when we see things day in and day out we feel it gets all around us we deal as

and Scott Greenberg or a few more different kinds of laws that we should touch on before our time is up\nWe should talk about the minimum age is to purchasing long guns and rifles four states California Hawaii Illinois and Florida passed new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State rep\nFrom Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State representative who ... who was a Republican sponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a.\nSerious speaking on W F ... in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of his interview\nA determining what age someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it and in many areas of our of our law making and so I think it was burned out on was the fact that you had an Eighteen year old a who did purchased this weapon I think I think without that particular fact he probably wouldn't have seen that\nWhat about law abiding Floridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom have gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas what are you say to those who feel like their Second Amendment rights are being\nFor what particularly that group of people that you mentioned are covered in the mall so if you have if you're a correctional officer if you're a parole officer if you're a law enforcement officer or or you served in the\nMilitary society has already said that you're trained and can carry a firearm so this bill would not impair that even at those ages\nThat state rep host the ... in Florida Republican state rep speaking to us for TV in Miami Chris I Wonder how you think it will play out with this law particularly because the n._r._a. is challenging it in court\nYes than our as challenging it in court I think a Marion Hammer has done a very effective lobbyists there for the\nNRA for a long time um had as suit filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing I think that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our interview 'em and be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to that a mass shooting and ...\nNatural reaction to the a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe of Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will note that Florida passed a package of laws uh the minimum age being one\nAll of which were a really designed to address the the type of issues that we saw\nA from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in the home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of package bills ah reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me is it passed in the state of Florida\nRat has long been one of the strongest a sort of ... of the ... legislative agenda and I think is very telling on obviously the reactions of Parkland and the the activism that took place immediately following a the Parkland shooting\nI Would like to come back to safe storage in a moment ... ... by the way we did a program when we visited Salt Lake city\nAbout guns in the mountain west states and and the nature of gun suicide in the mountain west in which the state representative who joined us showed us one of the sea storage lockers it does open with your fingerprints I tried it it it works it's it's pretty fascinating you can find the conversation on line at our website the one a dot org\nBefore we move on to other kinds of gun legislation Richard Feldman because I just get your sense in terms of\nThe end or raise real view on going\nThe ... real view\nOn gun legislation the ... has said that some measures like bump stock restrictions could be examined maybe through the administration's authority on a federal level rather than the state level\nOr we just kidding ourselves here should we just come out and just see the n._r._a. is not in favor of any new gun legislation that can be passed on a bipartisan basis are we trying to make the n._r._a. more ten fifth wheel and more collaborative than it really is\nWell first let's to find something I'm always a little bit of a loss to understand when people talk about the n._r._a.\nHarmon endowment number the n._r._a. there five million NRA members um there's the board of directors there's the senior leadership are there that can psalms there are many and our race\nThere's my uncle was a card carrying life member of the IRA edible show you his card on demand if you ask with great pride\nHas so many will myself included um but I I I think we're talking about the senior leadership\nOf NRA here and um again when I said earlier an array finds itself institutionally boxed in a corner of if you're calling it gun control no matter what it is it could mandate\nThat ah when you turned Twenty one you're given a gun they're almost institutionally has to be against it because of the terminology in the political position of the terms gun control\nThey don't mean that we sometimes think they mean\nThey don't mean what we sometimes think they mean are they mean different things to different people at different times\nWhich you know what I mean I'm Talking about Wayne LaPierre Oliver North of the leadership of the national Rifle Association will be here you know from the big ... the main figures who speak with a national voice for the n._r._a. it's the\nYou know the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun it's those ads with Dana last that say you know they are coming for our freedom and they use their media and the n._r._a. as you know the you know liberties laughed safe place that in our re that's who I'm Talking about\nWhat you're talking about that's politics\nThat's galvanizing the true believers that's about membership that's about fundraising that's about a organizing for the next a political event both sides to it and there's nothing unusual about that whether we're talking firearms or the environment\nOr any other hot button issues and America\nEverybody does it that way perhaps we see it a little more distinctly in the a firearm today than others but when we've been put on that side Scott well I just don't aside I wanted to ah just ah to to add to that that you've\nSeen on some of those issues issues you just mentioned and perhaps uh we're going to begin to see it on gun control as well that in cases where state legislatures are gridlocked and the power of a [noise]\nUm the gun lobby is such that ah that lawmakers won't pass anything I'm a there is a another outlet in many states and that's about an issue of Washington state will have about\nAre there is another outlet in many states and that's about initiative Washington state will have a ballot initiative in November that would raise the minimum age to buy a a\nSemi automatic rifle to Twenty one uh Oregon people in Oregon in support of a similar measure came close to getting out on the ballot so we may see that I mean that's that was a pattern with the marijuana legalization for example so that that might be a that might be coming in the future\nWhen we get to a few more of your calls and comments we did get a call about speed gun legislation in Missouri from a person who was working for a democratic state reps office this is what she left in our inbox\nThis is Emily ... calling from Missouri state\nRepresentative tracing the curies office in two thousand sixteen Missouri has ... six fifty six eliminating all permanent requirements for concealing carry in the state of Missouri leaving a loophole that allows domestic abusers to possess firearms since two thousand sixteen there's been a
