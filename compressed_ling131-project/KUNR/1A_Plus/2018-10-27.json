fistfight\n... his show she disappeared after walking into the Saudi constantly in Turkey more than three weeks ago Saudi officials first claimed he left the consulate than they claimed he just vanished than he they claimed he was killed accidentally while resisting Saudi agents\nNow they've said that his killing was premeditated current emerging why did the Saudis change their story again why are they saying that this attack was premeditated\nWell that's the big question isn't it right now on if this is just let him set aside a version as I said oh we're investigating they keep finding things out\nFor the Saudi version is which is oh we're investigating we keep finding things out\nOkay that's one thing except for that really doesn't ring as possible because they have\nBeen under enormous pressure and scrutiny and criticism from the United states for each of these explanations they've put out as finite and definitive first that he left the conflict then that it was an accident now that it wasn't an accident is premeditated\n... history keeps shifting and that is is is reducing trust in the Saudi um credibility undecided relationship frankly the United states\nWith every

they come from and and what made them start heading for the U.S for\nWell um for the most part they seem to be a migrants that started off in Central America that have been moving up through Mexico that are heading to the U.S border and this is something that's been organized to kind of make the point of the plight of the migrants that um I have been trying to travels a very very long way to get to the U.S border and are seeking a to come to the United states for\nEither reasons of ah economic attraction or because they are fleeing some sort of threat\nUm and that this is sort of thing that happens every day and less organized fashion it's become though a weapon or for the ... for for Trump to use in advance to the mid term elections they look at all these scary people coming towards our border there might be middle Easterners in there you know how do we know that there aren't you know bad people in that group which is just to quote his terminology used\nUm and this is kind of a poking at\nThe that that the existing um tension that exists in this country between people who are sympathetic toward the people who wants to come to the United states for various reasons of personal safety and economic stability and everything else\nAnd those people who think a scary outsiders don't let them in these plays real well with Trump's base Trump is trying to whip up his base in advance of the mid term elections because the Republicans need to hold on for dear life to make sure they keep\nThe majorities in both houses of Congress because house especially seems like it's quite likely to flip to Democrats and that will be a problematic for Trump in the last two years of his first term so it is um classic a it's a very emotional issue for people on both sides of this issue and this is a class\nIt's a very emotional issue for people on both sides of this issue and this is a classic uh politicking for how it's being portrayed right now I'm In an eye on television on nearly as as we're like two weeks out\nLoud it makes away from around the planet and everybody's going to cast their ballots healing how they feel about you know the issues that affect the country and how the president's capitalism\nOh hey before we continue talking about the care of and I'm Sorry I forgot to clarify something earlier in what we were discussing Michael Goldfarb raise the point\nAbout treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and we clarified that he did not attend the conference this so called Davos in the desert that is true but just to be clear the treasury secretary did meet with Saudis crown prince Mohammed bin solemn on on Monday in Riyadh he did not attend the conference\nBut he and the crown prince did meet one on one earlier this week\nMonday just by way of clarification\nRavi president troops sent ... President Trump sent troops to the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis has authorized deploying eight hundred more troops\nTo the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the the care of him\n[noise] well it it really is as car ruined was pointing out apply of thoughts to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to the to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also is is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry\nThey're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping or countries like Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor they they as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nOn their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives\nIn the United states they think that that children would have better lives in really there is no greater testament to American soft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with their feet and come to the the the United states and settle and have children and have better lives than simply\nAnd and so the troops are part of this larger\nA Trump and and and I guess Republican rhetoric\nThat play into the the idea that some migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as sources of great danger when in ... in fact a you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they are anything but and I also do want to point out a career and mentioned that President Trump\nAdmitted to the ... a A R mentioned that uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there's actually no evidence that points to the fact that they could be Middle East and perhaps more importantly\nHe was using um Middle Eastern as a slur of\nSorts which which which we believe we should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence said that there it's possible that mixed in with these thousands of migrants who were from Central America there may be a few dozen who\nFrom Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know ... ... ferry\nIs aims for the country ... and that's exactly right thank you for the car for vacation that but the the point I was getting too was that the use of the of of a Middle East and that's just the um ... is extremely dangerous because it it it it then tries to create the the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at as Carlin was pointing out again a movement that happens very often a you know migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states\nAnd the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now the numbering in the thousands is because it has been politicized here in the United states\nGoldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful with the language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments to us about that with these this terminology including the use of the word migrants\nMaria writes I Am Honduran I was born and raised in Honduras I came to the U.S to study and now I live and work here this quote unquote caravan is a cry for help cry of desperation from my people who will risk their lives to escape the extreme poverty and violence that I Know Israel\nThey are indeed refugees seeking refuge please don't blame them\nBlamed the corruption that has rotted the Honduran government\nAnd dug into Anthony tweet they are not migrants they are asylum seekers words matter now Michael Merriam Webster is my go choo\nMatter now Michael Merriam Webster is my goats do in terms of use the English language\nMiriam Webster defines a migrant as one who migrate such as a person who moves regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops a refugee is one that fleas\nEspecially a person who flees to a foreign country or power to escape danger or persecution what do you make of the words that we're using to describe this\nYou know just it was as you've been talking about this I ... I suddenly had Woody Guthrie's old song\nAbout about a group of migrants being sent back to Mexico in the Nineteen thirties and their plane crashed\nAnd they were cold deportees it's a beautiful song you you didn't look it up and ... ... listeners should strict YouTube after the show and and give it a listen there are many versions of it\nYeah you you know look I and I do think that in this case there there is a distinction you know we have a human wave coming out of sub Saharan Africa and the horn of Africa towards Europe and it's had a destabilizing effect on politics or as well\nAnd and I I Would identify most of these folks as as being migrants as opposed to people who come from countries which\nVery much as a result of American policy not just in the Nineteen eighties but you know going back\n\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the Alfred P Sloan Foundation bridging science technology and the art spices\nFrom the Alfred P Sloan Foundation bridging science technology and the arts by supporting exhibitions such as programmed to the Whitney Museum in New York City on view through April fourteenth more at Sloan dot org\nFrom the joy foundation committed to advancing racial equity and economic mobility for the next generation and the great lakes region learn more at Joyce F.

future topics will share some of your stories Monday when we wrap up our series the state we're in on one day\nBack now to our discussion with current emerging of the Washington Post Ravi ... of foreign policy magazine\nAnd Michael Goldfarb with the first rough draft of history the host and creator of that podcast let me come to you though I Wonder what you think of the overall message of Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer to the data industrial complex which has been a phrase that's been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex the prison industrial complex what did you make of of cooks remarks\nThought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now ... what he didn't stay in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's bad because I mean while he doesn't want to go that far but\nBut also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the\nThe uh the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both are but I think what all of these companies know collectively is that whether they like it or not regulation of some for some form is is on its way it's coming and so\nAt some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bill\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some\nAnd bill and I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states and the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it will then tail\nAnd and and and I think what cook has tried to do in the speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen anyway to try and appear to be one of the uh the tech support has a of a potential data privacy laws and the unite the\nWe should be clear also GDP are as the general data protection regulation it's there's a new area law that protects the privacy of data privacy of individuals within the EU or even the export of their personal data outside the you if you've noticed re in the last few months\nThat a lot of the Web sites you go to have had these pop up saying hey we use cookies on this website we maybe try your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups on those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist miss treatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name but then this happened at Britain's house of lords of ... do you see on the parliamentary privileged\nHappened at Britain's house of lords\nI feel it's my juicy under parliamentary privileged to name for the reading of the individual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of his story which is clearly in the public interest\nThat was the voice of lord Hain or Baron Hain of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privileged to name the billionaire at the center of this story Michael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this\nSuch a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example of clear example of the very significant differences between free speech laws in the u._k. and in the U.S\nWell that's certainly part of a job in in this particular case I'm having a parliamentary privileges is pretty\nUnique tool you can say things in parliament that you can't say outside and and not suffer and any libel actions and Peter hand was a working he'd been approached by some of the women who had spoken to the Daily Telegraph\nThere's this guy a Phillip Green is you know a fairly typical contemporary entrepreneur yet he was a night to by Tony Blair for services to retail is set up\nA series of of um clothing shops over over the decades and made himself very very wealthy indeed and um apparently he was just the kind of boss you would expect he was a bully and he was\nSexually harassed people and\nLike Harvey Weinstein when when he settled up there were no disclosure clauses inserted into the settlements and the difference of course is that in\nInto the settlements and the difference of course is that in the U.S New York times and the New Yorker can report that Harvey Weinstein is this and that and you know the details we can't get because of these nondisclosure agreements ... you know his name and here in Britain it's something else\nYou know moving to go to Michael good no no because I could go on about this guy forever and I will [laughter]\nWe appreciate that doing it on\nI was just going to say it's it's an interesting case really because of the way that the British laws are structured to say to have that that this this question which is the greater good here right because this is a\n... that the me too movement it's already been a question of can you know the the little guy or the little girl in this instance you know stand up against a big powerful wealthy usually male I'm In player who's pulling things a ... foot doing things that they shouldn't be doing but because of power and\nI'm In Flint is able to get away with it it it kind of the perfect I'm ... and ... it's kind of the perfect at ... I guess to see what is\nWhat society kind of value is protecting more is it the reputation of the accused in this way where India is can be applied newspapers that were never a party to them or is it getting this out in the public space and so there's like an extra level in the u._k.\nOf determining you know how much of a national or international conversation I guess at this point all of this is going to be in terms of does one wrong done effect you know an entire society and and how should I be sorted out\nRight now here in the U.S we are understandably focused on the mid term elections will Brazilians are focused on a presidential election they have to the polls on Sunday to choose between two radically different candidates in the second round of voting for ...\nCandidates in the second round of voting Fernando ... on the left ... is on the right in ... the lead in most polls many expect him to win the election joining us now from Sao paolo is Sarah ... who is Brazil correspondents for the economist Sara welcome to want to\nThank for having me\nRemind us about ... he's been pretty controversial explain to us why\nWell Booker has been a congressman for her a couple of decades now and has really become a film or blacks or any particular\nLegislation that got her and more for he's at a pastry ... comment and a woman and a minorities and ... and go and and ... even when they\nBurn a provocative recognize when they go a lot of people compare him to come by its own otherwise known as ... ... acres so\nI'm ... ... ... ... ... and I think an outsider or get on and then I got around to pretend to be going into a kind of hoping a so called up and put the country back on TALK\nShows that why he's so popular I mean you know the Brazil has had a number of issues that kind of a cascading issues with corruption over the years has just kind of she's outsider status has eclipse any social misgivings or maybe about him", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "27"}
