extremists Heidi welcome\nThanks for having me and NPR New York Nick Gillespie is editor at large for the libertarian magazine reason Nick thanks for joining us or my pleasure thanks for having me Jennifer let me start with you you've been paying very close attention to President Trump's rhetoric\nFrom an academic standpoint since twenty Fifteen during the campaign when after he announced his candidacy what have you noticed about his use of language particularly the most salient ways that you see it may be different from previous presidents\nYeah so Trump is very consistent with the way that he uses language he has he has the same sex rhetorical strategies throughout his campaign and his presidency\nAnd and and largely those are the strategies that presidents typically use for war rhetoric and so what I mean by that is you have lots of examples at the beginning of what we think of as a ... threat\nLots of examples at the beginning of what we think of as a backyard them threats threats of force we usually use those threats of force when we're trying to intimidate opponents\nUm when we're trying to shut down debate and discussion\nSo he does that repeatedly which are examples we're regret it showing he also uses ad hominem attacks us is attacking the person instead of their argument so we're used to these attacks and sometimes they're funny but they position people as objects of derision so corrupt Hillary or low energy Jeb or lion Ted\nUm those aren't affirming ways of describing your opponents and they certainly aren't legitimizing they are in fact do legitimize saying I'm opposition\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the Annenberg Foundation committed to supporting educating and engaging communities and the United states and globally for more

of political rhetoric in public life particularly these latest acts of politically motivated violence\nAnd whether or not President Trump bears any responsibility at all for these acts we're discussing with Jennifer ... in American political rhetoric expert from Texas a and M. university highly by wreck of the Southern Poverty Law Center and Nick Gillespie of reason magazine\nRonald writes on our Facebook page one hate speech is allowed a platform under the guise of free speech\nHate will proliferate and violence will\nFree speech hate will proliferate and violence will follow just wanted to read this comment by way of bringing up we've mentioned this on the program before but just to be clear\nHate speech is protected under the first amendment you are allowed to speak hateful things in public the line is when it fails what the Supreme Court calls the clear and present danger test when it's considered to be intended to cause imminent violence and likely to cause him and violent so I I hear where you're coming from Ronald but just\nTo be clear under the law hate speech is free speech speech that is designed to end likely the cause of violence that has not protected under the first amendment\nNick two of our commenters mentioned the same example which also has come up and free speech Supreme Court cases Robert writes research supports that hateful vitriolic speech drives hateful behavior the logic is blatantly obvious why is it illegal to yell fire in a crowded theater\nAnd ski a tweets if we can't yell fire in a crowded theatre watching the president yelled at immigrants lead to rapists in a crowded country Nick\nOr you know because that's the law and um you know it is amazing ah what we need a you know and and you know I I think part of part of what we're struggling with\nUm is Trump is a master of using the media to to make everything about himself and then everything becomes a referendum about him I mean literally since before he took office\nEvery news cycle every day I mean even you know the the day or a ... you know ... ... less than forty eight hours after the synagogue shooting he talked about the media is the true enemy of the people in it\nTalked about the media is the true enemy of the people and he's shifted the focus away from the synagogue shooting and the specifics of that back to\nHis ongoing a critique of the press one I think it's kind of pointing these comments I mean if you yell fire in a theater that is not in fact on fire then you can cause a stampede people hurt just based on saying one word fire that one word and cause trouble so by calling someone your enemy\nYou don't lean back when you feel an enemy is approaching you that's a word this is on one side action but this is also where you know and I mean it's a you know I'm a parent myself and it's kind of bizarre conversation to be having with the you know it was Seventy something year old man who's the president of the United states but it's like\nIf we continue to take the bait and by that I mean you know not ... we're all part of the media now in in various ways whether or not we actually you know have a a company that publishes a newspaper or something like that\nWe need to we need to be engaging this in a different way and it and I'm not saying that we we ignore it and things like that but\nYou know talking about the caravan is like is is fascinating um had reason we publish stories recently both looking at what is the makeup of the actual people in the caravan which is not you know a bunch of unknown middle Easterners as\nDonald Trump has tweeted and it's not ISIS agents and it's not even you know very many men\nAre looking at the demographics of the caravan looking at the countries that are emigrating from which the United states has a long history of of ah you know really bad foreign policy would make that kind of like that kind of feels like when someone yell fire in a crowded theater you ask well where in the\nTheater is is there a fire curtain right ...\nIn the theater is is there a fire curtain right ... ... it doesn't work that way that visceral reaction takes over and may well have taken over for this guy who shot at the synagogue in Pittsburgh it sounds like you're trying to have an apples and oranges argument is what I'm saying is you you are not you are not going to win an argument with Donald Trump by\nYou know being visceral and reactive to it like you you were what we need to do I think and this is part of the polarization but\nPolitics even as fewer and fewer people are identifying in political terms you know we're at historically low levels of identification as Republicans and Democrats as liberals and conservatives\nWhat these terms mean is now up for grabs it as it is leaking out of our life but the people who but we are acting as if it's the only thing that matters\nUm and I think this is when I say we need a different type of conversation we need a conversation\nThat is not simply about politics particularly electoral or partisan politics because\nPolitics is a zero sum game essentially him somebody wins and somebody loses and the winner gets to put their thumb in the eye of the people who lose this is a bad way to organize our everyday life there are parts where politics are absolutely important and and need to be dealt with\nBut Trump Trump is winning partly because he is able to keep us focus on this very narrow slice of our lives\nAnd he is dictating the discussion I'm Sorry I don't think you're hitting this nail in the head for me I'm Talking about the visceral and and maybe how ... how do you might go on about this throwaway I'm trying to explain this clearly but maybe I'm kind of facing the wrong direction how do you see\nThis well I'd like next call calls for a con passionate about that but I don't feel like that's the way that we can respond to what you know Trump is\nCon discussion about that but I don't feel like that's the way that we can respond to what you know Trump is dealing in other words in sort of been diverted the attempted civility that I Would argue prior presidents have tried to maintain out of the tone of the White House and I think he thrives on\nThe chaos and it involved with kind of hate rhetoric and raising the emotions people basically stoking fear um which is what we're seeing with the caravan and\nAnd I don't know how you bring that down a notch by calling for civility 'cause it just doesn't seem to be to be working as much as I Would love to have that\nAnd and I think Trump is that\nI'm not talking about civility what I'm Talking about is you know on on some level we need to ignore the president there have been a couple of calls for saying you know every time Trump\nTweets it's not news and every time he says something stupid and fact free or device of a device of it isn't news and we are acting as if you know she is you know every ... every breath but he takes us somehow meaningful um and and again you know I I agree that\nUm I I it's not that I wanted to ignore him but it's like if we could talk about policy if we could talk about actual things that are going on rather than every time Donald Trump\nYou know attacks suppressor says something about the NFL or et cetera like we we're we're playing into his fantasy I think a lot making him the center of the world I'll grant you that there is certainly a desire among many folks to talk more about policies and the hardcore politicking will\nGive some thought to maybe where this kind of conversation needs to go in the future when we continue with Nick Gillespie Heidi pirates and Jennifer ... tiny I Wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think are a number of people on the political right have raised which is this idea\nOn the political right have raised which is this idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around that the political discourse\nHas heated up in both directions many on the right has pointed to the left saying that they use similar rhetoric to the rhetoric that President Trump has been using but they don't get cold out for quite as much here is a sample of some of what they're referring to\nGet his time for us as Democrats [noise] to be as tough as they are getting painted as they are to be emitted as they are Michele always says you don't when they go low we don't know [laughter] they go low we can [noise]\n\nThat you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse and or the Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to recognize and respect strength\nThat of course was former secretary of state and democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton preceded by democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters and first was former attorney general Eric Holder Heidi what about the ... across the political spectrum how does that factor into into our current climate\nWell there's no question that there was ... as well on the left but I think it's a little ridiculous to try to say sort of like\nAs well on the left but I think it's a little ridiculous to try to say sort of like Donald Trump did after Charlottesville but there's some sort of equivalent here the real nastiness is coming from the right and it's coming on the basis of attacks on immigrants\nMuslims global is which many people would argue or anti Semitic theories and and there's something else more the violin is coming from the right we don't have domestic terrorism that's out of control from leftist that used to be the case in the Nineteen sixties\nBy friday sunny and

Carpenter is a master of horror movies end of the soundtracks that bring them to life his latest project as a return to the film that launched his career\nHalloween John Carpenter directed and scored the original back in Nineteen Seventy eight and he's the composer on the twenty Eighteen sequel which is in theaters now John Carpenter welcome to want to thank you for having me you've been away from the Halloween movie franchise for some time now what made you decide to come back\nOn his producer Hollywood producer Jason Blum a convinced me to come back\nI knew that one was a a a sequel was going to be made\nAs I Know a Malik cod he's the the son of the man who put up the money for the original Halloween so I knew there was a sequel coming\nBut Jason's bomb a talk to me and they said you know where it's going to be made with or without us so why don't we meaning he he and I\nI'm ...\nI mean he he and I\nI'm getting bored and try to help it'd be good so nobody had put it to me that way before so I thought that's a great great thing\nJason ... been doing some pretty interesting things with horror movies lately what what do you make of where the genre stance today\nThat's in good shape\nBut it's always in good shape horror has been was cinema since the very beginning and I have a feeling\nA it will be with us until doomsday just because everybody's scared of something that were all born afraid we all understand fear and so it's really fun to go to a horror movie with your girlfriend or your significant other and cuddle and scream and so forth\nWhat was it like for you not being in the directors chair for the twenty eighth team version of Halloween you were involved in the film but what about watching someone else direct this movie it was a relief\nBecause I don't have to suffer the stress and anxiety that directors suffer and that's a worst profession in the world other than being a coal miner\nThe worse other than a cold I'll come on now well it could it could be worse I guess you could be a slaughterhouse type measures that you're right ah it's not the worst now\nUh when when things were a it's great to be a director when they don't work it's it's really garbage\nWhat do you think movie fans least understand about what it takes to direct a movie especially a horror movie\nWell ever what are they at least understand let me think a a\nDirectors are responsible for all the central elements of a movie if it's supposed to be funny they're responsible for the humor of it if it's an adventure and so forth and so on so I'm director of a ...\nVenture and so forth and so on so I'm director of a horror movie think of it this way horror and comedy or a lot like\n'cause it's tiny it's all about timing and it's all about when things happen and how they unfold and it's more complex than than people assume but um people just think that horror as a lot of Gore and obvious violence and it's not\nYeah see I I I hear you on that it's an interesting analogy between horror and comedy I'm not big on Gore I Do not personally do well or on blood and Gore at all but a good suspenseful movie like I can I can hang with that 'cause that's that's a satisfying experience what what do you think\nIt takes to make that kind of timing in a horror movie\nWork what is it what does it take to make a horror movie work these are secrets that only the Brotherhood no so I Can't oh come on you can tell me something well look to make it really simple\nUh there are no rules for any horror film\nThe horror horror movies come out of the story and horror\nIs every action think of it that way not a genre it necessarily so it's a reaction to things and that if the story is is unfolding\nThen you use the story telling to a a\nA set up your scares and set up things they're\nFrightening for the audience he said the word earlier suspense that's what's you if you get the audience in suspense and you can scare them\nSo maybe the key is having a story it's got enough of the right elements to make me feel that suspense so that they're there can be that pay off so that there can be the scare is that it\nThat is correct you got it what about them\nThe the scare is that it that is correct you got it what about the music you contributed music to this film and and the music to the original in Nineteen Seventy eight what does it take to make that kind of music work for a scary movie what\nDoes it take it takes a certain amount of talent and ability to play musical instruments and feeling for him\nThat's what it takes now were you always musically inclined when you put the original movie Halloween together Nineteen Nineteen Seventy eight or was it something that kind of came together unexpectedly\nKnow as I grew up in a musical household my father was a music professor he was a\n[noise] a virtuoso violin player and he had taught a college level music courses at a university where I grew up I grew up with music in the house all the time classical music listening to it\nHe decided when I was about eight years old and I should learn to play the violin there was only one problem with that and I had no talent other than that it was a great idea\nBut I moved on from the violin to the piano and guitar and other things I picked a lot of stuff up\nWhere there any particular influences that you draw on when you made the music for the original Halloween or that you've drawn on over the years\nYes I'm all classical a\nMovie composers and classical ... ah musicians and rock and roll I'd get influenced everywhere\nWhat about the timing I did this seem to the original Halloween is not in a plain old for for your time it's in five four time it's in this odd kind of time's signature was what drew you to that\nMy father taught me five four time uh when I was Thirteen he'd try it on the head of ...\nTime uh when I was Thirteen he tried it on the I had a pair of bongos I got the Christmas we taught me five four on that and I thought it was unusual just straightforwardly unusual timing so\nAdapted that time's signature during the piano I'll be there we are\nWe're speaking to John ... the director of dozens of horror
