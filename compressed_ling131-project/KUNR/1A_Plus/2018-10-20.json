welcome to want to be good to be her back in our Washington studios Alexandra Jaffe a correspondent for vice news tonight on HBO Alexandra welcome back things adding and Franco or don't yes as a White House correspondent for McClatchy Franco good to have you with us great to be here\nLet's begin with politics in the run up to the midterms starting in Montana where President Trump campaigned last night and he made some comments that seemed to praise violence against journalists\nHe was speaking to a crowd of supporters when the president cheered Montana representative Gregg GM's forte for assaulting a reporter back in may here's what the president said\nYour body slammed me [noise]\nYour body slammed [noise]\n\nThe president went on to say that he had initially worried that the assault would tank G and forties campaign but said he remembered quote vicious Montana it might help him and it did unquote\nRepresentative GM's Ford's he pled guilty to a misdemeanor assault last year after body slamming Ben Jacobs a reporter for the guardian a judge sentenced him to a hundred eighty days deferred sentence forty hours of community service twenty hours of anger management and to find a

murder of your mouth her show gee the columnist from the Washington Post the president has a history of trash talking depressed to put it mildly\nCheering on somebody body slamming a reporter typically would say that's over the line but it's not really out of character for this president is\nNo it's not at all and and and it is putting it mildly mildly um you know this is this is

Hampshire public radio senior political correspondent Josh Rogers Franco or don't use White House correspondent for McClatchy and Alexandra Jaffe a correspondent for vice news tonight on HBO\nMartin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren released this DNA results\nYou showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares and hearing the story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to Andy's comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in some of the arguments that is what fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that's what could help Republicans I'm sort of succeed in the midterms\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the high road still seems to be the best static but we'll see how things play out\nThe higher ed still seems to be that static but we'll see how things play out\nIt's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandra saying look this is what happened in two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio jaded or\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his you know neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook him out on and I think it's very dangerous\nOr for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and that's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff Josh will if\nYou look at the way in which um you know a parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections I founded telling the gifts that they brought up\nA typically these would be people you know on presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been you know stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Ozzie and Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've the people who've drawn the most attention of the people who have cast themselves as Trump antagonist and\nUh the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know the the midterms of up here at least in favor of a sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nPolitician who at one point was in antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was\nIn antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke people are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the races still pretty tight and ... came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at one point Frank over ... ... what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that\nDebate [noise] um you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races it's ... it's been the most fascinating race probably a throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot a for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know tried not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's he's had to take a new tack\nUsing this language of lying in bed I'm attacking him about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for work\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for better or some\nUh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for better or some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like a that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexandra I was going to ask you whether or not what you read was on whether this could work I mean ... I Wonder if this debate uses any more insight into whether\nIt rather progressive Democrat like over ... has a chance in a state like Texas shoes you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved in the little\nI mean broadly it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in the midterms typically you\nKnow not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there's a major gas they typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows the Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which on election day of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think and under covered aspect\nOf this raises the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go and mark a box for Republicans\nAnd the strength of the Republican Party over all the strength of Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running you know against ed a Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties um seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if better over ark has been able to keep them to single digits\nI just wanna make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ... Republican and it automatically towns that vote drifts counting for all the Republicans on the ticket\nYet you can basically built for every Republican all at once I'm this is the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket\nOne um this is the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that it won't be as easy will\nFundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they would do on Monday and the results\nLook pretty good for Democrats and house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fund raising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers outraged Ninety two Republican incumbents more than six the Democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars that corner\nIn the Senate Democrats are also out raising Republicans ... raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races\nAlso glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas Cameron tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen the\nWeather Channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nThere are still people missing there still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think the town and Mexico beach has not reporting given any numbers\nThe town and Mexico beach has not reporting given any numbers\nUm of how many people are are missing 'em but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this was a massive storm I'm Talking about one of the biggest storms of the top three or perhaps by some accounts that you know had made\nLandfall that would make it bigger than Katrina\nThis has been a huge effort many people still do not thousands still don't have a phone service um and people are expecting asked film is sewn services restored and more roads are cleared and you're able to get more to people that they are expecting the death toll to continue to rise\nWhen Alexander the other big issue is when people can actually start\nTo rebuild I mean it's it's fascinating and terrifying horrifying at the same time to look at some of the early drained camera pictures from where hurricane Michael came ashore from where it made landfall\nYou can almost tell which homes were built up to the latest building codes and which homes were not because of homes that were up to codes were there and the homes that weren't were gone and I wonder what points the the ... the rebuilding effort is right now is there any effort is there any expectation on when people could start to rebuild\nAnd I was actually in North Carolina for the previous hurricane there and they were saying you know anywhere from six to twelve to twenty four months people would still be in shelters waiting to rebuild and that was just flooding\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Carnegie Corporation of New York

don't is Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire\nThe race in district one will be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress\nHis Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district that Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen right\nAbsolutely and trading him of party to party from two thousand eight or the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats winning in presidential years is now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's retiring I'm In ... where do you have people who are\nRunning really within the mainstream of their parties are pappas has been serving in various\nElective offices for a long time he's in his late thirties he says family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester often to stop for presidential candidates he um he comes from Manchester which is a town the worthy\nHe um he comes from Manchester which is a town that where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters\nUm Eddie Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time led the states uh enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores liquor is controlled by the state uh it was a fairly big job he a random enforcement division and he's been a police chief\nUm you know they were pretty much keeping to well within the norm to their party Eddie Edwards has you know embrace Donald Trump he every Giuliani up here campaigning with them [noise]\nUm and he's in some ways trying to cast Chris ... says you know part of some sort of resistance movement and saying we've obviously the nationally Chris Pappas as you\nKnow hardly or a radical guy or you know family I'm Ron restaurant a working I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um and uh this race though is one where the seat can go either way and uh both parties believe they have a shot\nThere's also a gubernatorial race underway here the Republican government governor ... new new faces Democrat Molly Kelly she is one of the Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number\nThe latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that tally the Democrat has outraged Sununu the incumbent Republican three to one a ... here since ... brand of New York came to conquered on yesterday to help campaign for Kelly\nThey met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave if I'm interested in\nCandy shop and they discussed paid family leave I'm interested in where this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but here as part of what happened with your ... listen\nIt's going to help families happier and healthier it's going to help people be more productive at work and so\nIt's a win win everywhere I go in the state I hear about the need for paid family medical leave and how important it is for people\nTo be able to have the choices in their life to be able to work hard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they loved him out when they're needed the most\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator Gillibrand was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is this paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will\nIt's been a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test me she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue um it's a challenge to somebody covering the first how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling that suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue he was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it\nAt the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction imagine to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\n'em in the Democrats believe this was a need for that works for Mali Kelly by dint of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids of work the way through college and that you know ... new new sort of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh you know doesn't understand the\nSenator uh you know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get at New Hampshire has kind of a bifurcated economy\nUh you know boom times for people's the upper income we have budget surpluses and tax collections are up but you know the wage growth for people at the lower end of the scale\nHas not been great and\nThis is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race well I'm ... you know ... should win or do we have to your terms here no governor has been tossed after one term\nUh since two thousand four and prior to that it had been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those er here polling indicates new news\nUpper by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers and Molly has outrageous person in three to one and the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch of this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he will freely admit he doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only got he's got four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand interest groups will will add to that are in terms of advertising but this is a race that Democrats feel they have a chance to win if if a blue wave a venture weights and they think that Molly Kelly a bite\nIn her background but in being a woman is somebody who ... best engineered to kind of ride away speaking of nationally known names\nBest engineered to kind of ride away speaking of nationally known names Frank or don't is I Wonder what your senses of senator Jill brand making the trip to help Mali Kelly is there is speculation about her future maybe in twenty twenty there's a lot of speculation\nAbout her future and twenty twenty um I think how much is it kinda resonate as as the big question I mean obviously\nA there's so many names being kicked around ah right now or that you know it I think time will tell but there there's no question that killed ran is one of the people that that people are talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move\nOr that she makes 'em as being picked apart um you know analyze a and looking for it how it could mean and how it could uh what impact it could have on twenty twenty\nLots to discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because the Treasury Department revealed this week that the deficit has grown\nLast year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred sixty six billion this week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars it's a six year high end projection say it is on track by the end of this decade\nTo hit a trillion dollars the deficit a trillion dollars\nNow Alexandra some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being responsible for this particularly the tax bill\nPart of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts is it by cutting taxes business what kind of unleash more productivity the economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest would more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out\nFor whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out so far\n... well we haven't seen that yet certainly and in fairness Republicans are arguing that that's going to take 'em you know about a decade to even out do at this rate although the economy is booming there's there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at at this point\nUm it was sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around was welfare reform\nUm to to cut down on the deficit and that conversation has started again on Capitol Hill\nI'm that obviously won't move forward until after the midterms but there is conversation about to get you know starting to work on\nA welfare reform bill that would cut some public benefits um like Medicare that kind of thing um and so going forward you know it's interesting to hear or to the Republican silence on this issue when they were previously the party of deficits\nBut it's also an opportunity for them politically to push another priority of the Republican Party which again is welfare reform\nYeah I'm Glad you mentioned that because Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blamed the rising deficit on public assistance programs in an interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday what's going on with that\nIt's very disturbing images ruined by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular
