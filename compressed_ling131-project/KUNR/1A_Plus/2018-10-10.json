professor at the University of Houston graduate College of social work\nHer new book is called dear to lead veering greatly and rising strong at work and she joins us here in Studio ... brown welcome to one day I'm excited to be here I read the book and you say early in the book that it does follow up to a lot of your previous\nWork I imagine there was a point at which you wanted to take some of the findings you head\nBruce you had your developed through your research\nAnd apply them were practically especially because you do speak to a lot of business groups across the country around here\nI Do I say I spend about for the past five years I Would say I spend Ninety percent of my time in organizations working with leaders and talking about leadership innovation and creativity uh recently talking about a A R I and machine learning and kind of the consequences of that that the rise of the machine\n[laughter] so you know for me\nIt was probably I don't know six or seven years ago um\nWe had this mission at kind of where I work at our organization of making the world of bravery place and it really struck me that if we don't change the way we work we can't change the world because we spend too much time at work\nUm and I think everyone listening at least my experiences than when that's a bad experience with it\nAt least my experience has been when that's a bad experience with NASA toxic environment when we are in bad relationships at work our whole lives to just fall apart\nOne of the things that you described in your speeches I forget which of your TED Talks it was but you talked about how business group started reach out to you and they say they want you to talk about creativity and innovation and and the future but please don't bring up shame vulnerability or any of that difficult stuff and your response to that was\n[laughter] I can see why you have a problem [laughter] you know it right there yeah I mean that's the thing so\nIf you don't have a culture that is prepared and understands failure set back and disappointment don't ask people to innovate because failure is a prerequisite for innovation is by debt you know you bankrupt innovation on its own terms when you say nothing can fail\nYou know and then what happens and I think we see this a lot today and I think we see it and civic organizations government corporations faith communities we see people only doing what they're already good at doing\nAnd and we were the problems are too big that we face today\nDo you think that we're more like that now that we've been in the past where we kind of

book is called dear to lead speaking of the world of work we learned today that a high profile woman in the Trump Administration is leaving her job at the end of this year\nNikki Haley is America's ambassador to the United nations and this morning she announced her resignation in the resignation letter Haley says she plans to return to the private sector after fourteen years in public office\nHaley has formerly the governor of South Carolina has somewhat international reputation for being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on everything but says there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShe will also be remembered in part for striking back and White House adviser Larry Kudlow who suggested she might have been confused regarding Russian sanctions she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get confused\nShe and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nCan't say enough good things about Jared and Iraq I buried in a sense that no one understand I mean can you\nGenius that no one understands\nI mean to redo the NAFTA deal the way he did um what I'd done working with him on the middle east peace plan it is so unbelievably well done and an office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the thing\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're a better country because they are in this administration I also just have to say I'm certainly thank you to my family Michael is the same and um my two little ones I adore them\nEntertain us un you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time and energy into it um but they have a lot\nI'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good slate and on for the next ... to come in but now I don't have\nI'm going to go I think that um the main thing was I was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand your blood or church shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then to come in\nAnd do through years of Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to be self was enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so\nThank you Mr President gets in an honorable\nMy son and I will say\nThis I'm for all of you that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can promise you what I'll be doing is campaigning for this one so I look forward to supporting the president and the next\nAs invested or Nikki Haley who represents to us to the United nations speaking this morning at the White House announcing that she will be rich\nNations speaking this morning at the White House announcing that she will be resigning at the end of the year\nBack now to our conversation with Bernie brown and maybe by way of a transition we should get to an email ... writes I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed for work environments ... have you noticed the difference\nAnd absolutely absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune from the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen\nIncreased polarization in our families and our neighborhoods among our friends at work to end it feels dicey or at work um I think that\nPeople have to be careful and especially when there's power differential and it it's I I actually believe it's become a pretty significant source of anxiety at work and home\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of these other dividing line\nThere because everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nTo see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to kind of open up\nIf that ... toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just needs to be the one person I Need to keep my head down and get to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we started talking about empathizing and being vulnerable and being open and compassionate and ... that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted\nOr you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love that is going to turn into a job\nWho I pray to or who I Love that's going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like it's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of less\nI think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I'd never seen anything meaningful are significant come from mouth shut had down\nIn my career\nThat's just not how we make contributions and so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and\nRumble and we use the term rumble because it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle it's a foundational skill set\nI don't think spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\n\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high and we're not solving problems\nI Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experience as all of who you are to address the problems\nFrom reading your book and based on the research that fueled the book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a star yeah you know a star is tough because the wind is tender right ensue if there wasn't something tenders there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really [noise]\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really\nIt was actually voided my hypothesis going in so where did you drop off yeah yeah it just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at Jesse what I'm going to find but not in this case so\nWe asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders that the it's a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred and fifty sea level global leaders three years building a daring leader assessment so people can see where they are and these were NBA and NBA students\nAt Wharton Kellogg Rice University and then tons of data evaluation data so I thought when when when\nIt was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need braver leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear but then we went and talked to several dairy leaders and said so you're not afraid very often and they were like\nWhat I'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long and it was like so that blew my hypothesis of fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to daring leadership\nIs armor it's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger\nThe having to be the newer and get everything right instead of being the learner\nUm so really you know and it's interesting what you said about scars intend to places\nNot only does armor keep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear and less it faster and grow and\nLess it faster and grow and metastasize so\nWe need to create were cultures where armor is not rewarded or needed we\nAsked some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left in our inbox first let's hear from Adam\nMy name is Adam and I'm calling from Nashville, Tennessee\nI'm a paramedic and fire fighter and as such I definitely feel like I Need to do my job perfectly at all times because there are definitely times one lives in livelihoods are on the line if I was on the other hand I worked for a department that's very good about support and it's an old ...\nAnd my co workers and I definitely do a good job of trying to share and better get stressed at the job\nAdam thanks very much for calling and sharing your story with us no contrast Adam's story which is the bells story she works in a similarly strict workplace was a rather different take\nOn a doctor at a big hospital and it's just really hard to suggest that anyone to feel safe there you have to watch everything you say and do and there's so many corporate compliance policy I Would say like it's not a safe place to be human at all\nIs the bill we appreciate you sharing your story as well bringing it sounds like they are one might think that being in one of these high pressure leadership environments would lead to more common experiences but both of these folks are in places where lives are on the line with wildly different experiences what's the variable that makes a difference there\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Americans for the arts committed

world is talking about a new report by some of the most renowned climate scientists putting a finer point on just how little time we have to do something about our warming planet\nThe report states that we have until about the year twenty forty before we reach a point of no return it also gives reason for hope that we have the skills to do something if we work together\nWe want to answer your questions about what it would practically take to fight climate change leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one egg we'd also love to know what you're working on to fight climate change in a big way\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a or you can use our app won a vox pop to send us a high quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics you can find one a vox pop V. O. X. P. O. P.\nIn the app store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Renee brown author of the new book dear to lead with regards to armor muddy sold emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually a big part of this box in his batteries are incredibly important um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and sell armor\nWe find that very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and so armor is not\nAbout professional management of south it's not about foreign going boundaries armor is about defense it it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I might protect feeling good about myself\nOver moving our work forward\nSo there's a difference between say armor an image such as kind of the silk that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's it's ... it's on a deeper level now it's on a day\nBut I mean the one of the greatest examples of armor armored leadership versus airing leadership as one form of armor we see a lot and folks is that need to be right that it's that I've got to be the ... and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting it right\nWe got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which racial power structures and broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace\nDisproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor ... tweeted\nAs a woman of color an immigrant and an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming that distrust well here's one of the\nBiggest findings I think is that one of the greatest casualties of trauma\nOne of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the loss of vulnerability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic and said that I mean racism homophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nThose are those are everyday traumas and it is real that that that that you know the armor that you need to survive those things Israel which is why if leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender as another you know I I think the kind of\nAnita Hill criticisms that happen after the for testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during a way that we are more than you got your dad\nWho was you know but absolutely vulnerability can be used against us um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core\nValues and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some kind\nOf mission statement or vision clarification or posters everywhere thing is is that we're supposed to be and then it's really worth nothing more than a paper on which was printed I worked at some companies wind been to some companies were the value statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well why don't we start\nYou suggest that we should limit our core values to to just to and there's a long list in the book\nValues to to just to and there's a long list in the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list and I really struggled barrel down to my to why only two\nWell here's the thing if you don't operation allies values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat poster I mean it\nReally is [laughter] it's just really a poster so I'm a recording of my head but little town [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter]\nYou know and so what was so you know operation lies values into behaviors\nFewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with have actually done that have taken the time to say you know what a some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in and so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data\nThe men and women\nWho had the capacity to be the most courageous could identify their values and they had two to three values and you know I have you know there's a long list in the book like we talked about and there's hardly Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nAltruism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independence self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to it my two Corvette my to core values for me are facing courage and\nTo core values for me or faith encourage\nAnd I know those are the core values because it's the place where every other thing on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we have a companion workbook it's free it's downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational as an end to behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we have our company values and that's actually how we assess you every quarter\nWas on the values that you were to do with\nLike for example one of our values is take good care taking care of each other ourselves in the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean you either do it or you don't\nAnd so I think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that as a real core finding which is courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught it's learning how to rumble with on her ability living into your values which we're talking about right now\nIt's braving trust understanding how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nHe needs to clear the trial use I mean I I Would be fast foods and know what you live near I now think my core values are because I knew what they are I went to the list I finally figured on my too but I don't know that anyone would guess what my to war based on who I Am the work I Do like I guess one\nWhat my two were based on who I Am the work I Do like I guess one\nSure can't try sure OK face no\nThere's not one of my two ... but it's incompetent what am I to cause but no I didn't tell us what you see like I don't know maybe I should maybe I shouldn't and we're talking about on her delegate Joshua no but I'm the host I don't have to do anything I'm just I'm In charge here here we got people that one no knowledge okay okay fine I'll tell you what the\nFreedom and growth those are

Michael but um\n[noise] we can't say that the higher can\nDirectly related to global warming but we can say is that ... these ... increasing as a result of global warming because we're all my atmosphere had no energy can hold more water ... are\nThe chances that based on the extreme it that whether it's harkens or extreme rainfall or heat waves are increasing with three little bits are wanting\nMe to a few more of your comments Sarah emailed I feel overwhelmed by the talk about climate change and don't feel like there is a unified voice out they're letting families no what concrete steps they can take to make a difference for\nOur family this has led to ever present feelings of helplessness anxiety and guilt about the choices we make every day Sarah we will be talking about some concrete options and just a moment but let me get to a few more thoughts that have come in the far Joel emailed\nYou should stop framing this as what will politicians do politicians reflect the people that voted for them half the voters in the U.S read Donald Trump's tweet that global warming was a Chinese hopes and voted for him anyway that just goes to show how important the issue as to the people in this country\nCruel Davenport I Wonder if you could respond to Joel's email I mean the president has committed to taking us out of the Paris Agreement he kind of questions the provenance of the agreement bikes\nOut of the Paris Agreement he kind of questions the provenance of the agreement by saying well who wrote it up let me see wrote a mental believe it does Joel have a point\nOh well in in terms of um Paul policies being policies that address climate change on the U.S really isn't a\nA distinctive place right now I think I'm Around the rest of the world we do see an expression of will by leaders\nTo um enact policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions I think that there's a lot of questions on how strong those policies actually are um you know the analysis shows that they're they're not strong enough to limit warming even to that that initial two degrees but do you in the U. S.\nUm what we see is President Trump not only you know essentially questioning that the basic established of of\nClimate change but but also moving to undo existing climate policies I'm President Trump has already moved forward with policies to undo regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants on undo or weekend um regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from cars\nUm and he had said that it is his objective to promote the use of coal\nI'm burning coal is one of the leading contributors to greenhouse gas emissions\nA President Trump wants to promote the use of calling us and abroad um one of the findings of this report is that in order to um limit greenhouse limit climate change to um you know to to to the sort of least destructive\nUm level of warming um the use of coal will have to uh basically go down to zero I'm by by twenty fifty so\nUh basically go down to zero\nI'm by by twenty fifty so ... basically no more on just about no more coal and and and and it is you know that that it that is an extremely disruptive policy recommendation um there's no question that there are industries and people who will be harmed\nWho who will have their livelihoods disrupted by policies um that go in that direction let me\nLet me just once I started to shore call but I Wonder in terms of the politics behind this and I hear you on I I totally hear you on how disruptive versus it's all like coal is so interwoven in the network of America's energy grits kind of hard to just drink it all out\nI Wonder though in terms of the voices on the world stage who we we know that there was this who are saying well coal it'd be really hard to pull out\nTo get the sense that there's any one of the world stage saying tough our planet is only home you light pole tough we got to get rid of it deal with on you or California so Jerry Brown the governor of California for sure\nAnd many of the ... the president of France has sought to kind of a step in and um\nHe he's trying to carve out a place for himself as as a as a leader on climate change it's it's not difficult for France to take that position because France um doesn't really use call\n'em so but but but we I mean we absolutely see world leader saying you know this is what what needs to happen\nUm [noise] in China it's very interesting because um China is the world's largest um greenhouse gas polluter and is NASA user of coal at the same time we're ... the the Chinese government has moved forward with I'm actually in acting um prices\nChinese government has moved forward with I'm actually in acting um prices on carbon are at their their their enacting a cap and trade system that would force\nUm carbon polluters corporate leaders to essentially pay attacks or the um in in order to pollute which is designed to drive the market away from from greenhouse gas has an idea that was invented in the United states by is\nI'm considered sort of politically toxic here in China they can implement it by ... they don't have to deal with that Congress voting against at Iraq and then the United states\nOf doing it or you want to talk more about that idea of carbon taxes we continue in just a moment but let me get to a few more comments uh Brian emailed\nWe have no leaders anymore with the skills or courage to do what's right regardless of the political cost we will keep polluting as long as the price of fossil fuels is low would be interested to hear from some of you listening who you trust who you think some of the leaders are politically in this country around the world\nWho you believe are sincere in their push to do something significant about climate change is there anybody that you think is for real and saying that we're going to make this happen or maybe if you were active with\nA politician or a government leader or a government agency that's doing something tangible that you feel people should know more about we'd love to hear from you what gives you hope\nThat climate change is something that is actively being worked on where you are email is one a at W. A. M. U. dot org by the way we've been talking in terms of degrees Celsius yes I Know where we are if you need a little conversion\nOne point five degrees Celsius we mentioned one and a half degrees and two degrees for those of you don't have a conversion calculator in your head one and a half degrees Celsius is about two and a half to ...\nIn your head one and a half degrees Celsius is about two and a half to point seven degrees Fahrenheit and two degrees Celsius is about three and a half degrees Fahrenheit about three point six degrees anyway\nTom posted on our Facebook page Wendy quote unquote global warming scare first appeared long ago it was made a political position by the Democratic party that immediately convinced me that the manmade weather change is nothing but a political hoax to fool the stupid\nProfessor live from in what would you say to tell them well\nI grew up in a country Britain where it's not political and so for the first part of my life I Lived in a country where politicians and the public um trusted scientist and a\nAccepted that global warming is happening so when I moved to the U.S I guess it was I'm a little surprising to find how prompted than this basic scientific problem is um and\nIt's nine forty this is Kay you in our public radio [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from love me in makers of go to meeting a collaboration meeting

conversation with Coral Davenport of the New York times and University of Arizona professor Diana Lieberman we got a number of messages from you in terms of how you are trying to make an impact with the fight against climate change here is a little mash up of two of the messages we got this is Amy from Chesapeake in ... in Michigan listen\nI'm getting a sore to slash ... thoughts last feeling of powerlessness um that I Can't do enough to stop that the path of destruction that we're on\nOur pessimism comes because I Believe the what's happening to the world\nTo Larry Summers and of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker and George Schultz the Baker shields carbon ... plan but Joshua let me clarify we have there is a separate spin off organization that as a lobbying organization and that now has corporate funding including from Exxon\nOkay and that is connected to the organization or use it as a spin off but it's there's still a connection in any way or completely separate\nUh it is a separate organization that is the advocacy arm of the climate leadership council so the council develops this ground bake breaking plan were all sides wind and Americans for carbon dividends which was co chaired by former Republican Senate majority leader Trent Lott and a\nA center bro that group lobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power interests\nCurled up in Fort let's take a step back before we get into the plan that the climate leadership council is advocating more specifically defined this term carbon tax for us what exactly is a carbon tax\nShores so um\nThe idea of a carbon tax is um ... each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere um you can put a price on how much economic harm it causes\nUm and at ... and I ... and important to note on that as the the economist who came up with with that idea his name is William North house he's a professor at Yale I'm was just awarded the Nobel Prize for this idea on Monday\nOr the same day that the IPC came out with this report which heavily sites I'm professor north houses work\nUm so he came up with the idea of every ton of carbon um traps key\nEvery ton of carbon um traps heat in the atmosphere and you can put a price on how much each ton of carbon hurts a the global economy um and and there's a range for how much that costs that it can range from um fifty dollars a ton to a hundred dollars a ton\nUm you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost but once you sort of place that price on carbon um then you are can essentially um create attacks um above a price on carbon or attacks on carbon that you would impose upon polluters of carbon dioxide no no\nNo a carbon which ones are going to be really clear in terms of\nWho the taxes paid on I mean if I Am a car Baker do I pay the was almost ... pollution from automobiles does the carmaker pay carbon tax for producing the vehicle that ... carbon dioxide or does the oil company pay the carbon tax for finding the gas alone it's likely\nMost likely you pay at a as a car driver I'm older\nAnd and and and you you would so um we don't have carbon taxes in the u._s.\nUm so in some ways this this is sort of um you know in intellectual debate although other countries are are working are sort of further along on this but the idea is\nUm if this would affect how you drive it would probably um be taxed based on how much carbon a carbon dioxide would be a produced by burning\n'em by burning gasoline show it would most likely be added to the cost of the gasoline that you put in your car so if you're going to put in and in Mount of gasoline in your car that would produce a certain amount of carbon dioxide when you burn it down\nFamily of four would get approximately two thousand dollars per year\nIn dividends and here's how the system would work the more you pollute the more you pay the less you pollute the more you win so Seventy percent of American families would come out economically ahead and that's what's so transformative about the dividend concept which is that we can have\nThe most effective climate lever which is a carbon tax in a manner that is popular populist and equitable for the American people\nHow much of that money would be spent on environmental programs are planting forests or doing research on cleaner energy with all of it just come back to us as taxpayers\nA hundred percent would go back to the American people and that is what makes the plan a popular\nAnd politically viable because in ... on Capitol Hill you'll never get the two sides to agree on how to spend the revenue Republicans will say well let's spend on deficit reduction are lowering the corporate income tax Democrats will say well let's spend it on a renewable energy innovation or a low income support\nIt opens up Pandora's box by contrast when you returned all the money directly to the American people it closes that box and what polling shows is that it's overwhelmingly popular most interesting\nThere's three to one support among Republican voters and Trump supporters for this plan for the one support among millennials which of course or soon to be the largest voting cohort\nAt ten o'clock\nIt is a classic love story one that Hollywood has told for decades were audience is saying now

you might want to listen to this conversation later on line at the one a dot org let's get to a few more of your calls Heather in Indianapolis is on the line hey Heather what's on your mind what'd you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it but I loved it for the entertainment value but my big piece was that moment when he brought her onstage and knowing that was not her comfort zone knowing what she'd been told that she wasn't going to be good enough that no one would care that no one there to find her interesting or attractive\nAnd she just went out and she killed it and they loved it and for that has second ISI that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her that was a pretty important moment if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself out there for the same reasons\nIs kind of a big moment yeah I I I hear you on that just does that resonate for you in a way like was there something personal that that made you flash back to er sad about for a lay\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know I Do a lot of things where I have to go out in front of crowd or in front of people and you often hear you know you need to be dinner or project lower or beat this or that are younger and at that moment with kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that moment that we can personalize it whether it's in an interview or\nWhat have you and I think that was an important or with\nHeather what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her no\nYes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight\nWell that thing with her nose\nYeah yes I mean and I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she's like this is my name is all me to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and um I think it it kind of the ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that Ali billboard and he says we should have just made the old billboard you're knows\nI mean I think the thing about the comments about our nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a\nExist in and thrive in Hollywood as far as the coming to the music industry it absolutely is a powerful comment on the music industry\nAs the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing has placed in time where this movie is a place in time it's interesting to think about that\nBecause almost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's really no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming playlists and um the major record labels having less\nPower than they used to so it's almost like old fashion and its view of the music industry but only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie Linda\nCollapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also chime in but by the way food for those who have not seen star is born will not be seeing stars one but just kind of want to be in on the conversation she\nTells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose you know just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go into homes I Wonder how you view the commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie\nI felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art I also thought about pink\nWho is very much and invention of pop music but who also have this kind of rye cynical style style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with a view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways is very linear it's a very linear idea of there is the one I'm rose to fame there is one path you just simply offend or D sand as opposed to\nThere is no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming with out kind of going through that traditional Paso agree with Anna about that but I think\nOut kind of going through that traditional Paso agree with and about that but I think\nThat um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them pass each other on this fame ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about Lady Gaga you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who has been so able\nTo make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean the funny thing about this movie is she is way more important to culture than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from you know Bradley Cooper who's had a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd and that way\nYeah except for the voice in rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean she is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley spend a lot of time sitting up\nThat first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a store is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga is character Eli is just improvising all of saw him on this phone thing or\nUh to to to do\n... time can\nTo [noise]\n\nWho's really been [noise]\nBradley Cooper Lady Gaga in a star is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano and saying and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we sang together I mean everything's live we say we sing everything live in the movie wow you there's nothing we're not just lives thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's seen next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in a scene is actors fully believing that you're the character you can't not believe it yourself so she really gave me that confidence\nBradley Cooper speaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration between Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga particularly how it came out in the way the love story played out\nThis is my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meets jak he was a stumbling blackout drunk\nAnd I think it looks as if he's just spend a weekend at a bar do Kevin Cavanaugh KCUR and I don't find that interesting or attractive if she had met him sober and he fell into alcoholism\nIf if she had met him sober and he fell into alcoholism and stayed with him it'd be more interesting he's\nHe's increasingly mean he has petty and I think as his alcoholism ... becomes words he continues to treat her worse and yes he's Bradley Cooper and yes he's is incredibly talented musician but I never really bought fully what alleys saw in him\nHolds a pop ups along the

gene is listening in Indianapolis hey gene what did you think of a star is born\nHeater gene can you hear me yes I have a five stars which why five stars [noise] um\nI just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one seem particularly well updated to today um I thought it was the the irony of her being discovered\nBecause he was a drunk and looking for a drink and their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was the continuing thing and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent\nI guess he was her agent uh the guy who made her over the manager day and age\nOther people have mentioned is the part that her agent I guess he was her agent uh the guy who made her over the manager do agent played\nYeah ... what did you learn character\nI didn't like him and I I guess I wasn't supposed to\nBut ah the minute he had that conversation with Jackson um\nAnd and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him of being a problem in that whole relationship I just I just knew that that was going to be the start of of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear your dream a hundred percent of ... and I I figure I heard you chime in as well\nNo that was ... yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of the story one of the tricks with the manager is I think\nThey do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is I'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them\nFrom the beginning um but then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forced element that\nIt doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes into just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed it because when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate in ...\nFrom the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate in a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really deal with the job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough\nTo drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest\nOf the film was I agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell and there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on stage to rehearse with her and he can't keep up or he keeps for getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right that that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way for me\nIt exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of that the narrative issue with the ending\nWas uh oh go ahead and go ahead\nOf course of course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine or the fame monster is like the guy got what's called it and one of her album ah destroys people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of star is born in there and in fact all the bridges of the SARS going to have that manager character in a different embodiment um that character in this film I absolutely agree\nIn this film I absolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost with a sympathetic enabler um of of the male lead and who then\nWas like hey you know we're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name of alley or in the star is born versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of being part of the cast you know has to be there um\nI also just want to say before we end gotta get this out there that um\nThis is also the story of how\nA woman's rise leads to a man's fall [laughter] and that's an internal problem with the stars bar and you know um it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama has traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nA ... toward the lead female character but there is this underlying sense has to say it that even as Jackson, Maine is saved temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from\nHis young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushing the periphery feminist reading problematic\nFilm well but you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a feeling meal ego\nFemale star nursing a failing male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era\nWe get to a few more of your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars\nI deeply appreciative ... nuanced shyness in her early portrayal which made main characters advising her work well I'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance\nHis scenes seemed a little too detached from Maine overall I Love the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from our bureau in ... North Carolina who tweeted three stars a star is born was a story the performances especially the musical ones were fantastic\nAnd the cinematography was incredible I expect a lot of nominations to come for deep ie the director of photography the cinematographer Matthew ... production designer Karen Murphy costumer ... score original saw\nAn ad attacking John horns spoke with the cinematographer Matthew ... about shooting live performances which are not really straightforward spaces to navigate here as a part of that conversation from Cape PC sees the frame\nThis film was very difficult to sort of um navigate the stage performances because we had three different modes basically we had the Coachella mode which is I'm borrowing stages or that were already set up with the lady that was already existing\nAnd putting in our own crowds and then there was the I'm running guns sort of we have ten minutes to shoot him between two sets with a real audience apologizing in thanking the audience\nTwo sets with a real audience apologizing in thanking the audience for I'm sort of I'm shooting a movie in between two bands and then we had the third which is the Greek theater which in which shallow was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie fashioned was able to create the Greek theater as a set\nAnd put a certain amount of crowded and so that was my most controlled a scenario but the lighting of it had to have a consistency might my goal was that um you know in creating a a character from sin cinematography standpoint\nJackson, Maine might as well be um [noise] oh I don't know Jack White and I had to make sure that um the audience maybe subconsciously filled the this is his lady in\nThis is his road show and it's also in the film in the sort of visual movement of it all representation of rock and roll\nThat was a mass you live at seek the cinematographer on a star is born speaking to John horn on Cape he sees the frame John can you talk a little bit more about the making of this film particularly back to Kathleen question who wrote on Facebook how you can tell if a film is well directed this kind of a film\nThe way that Matthew described it presents all kinds of additional challenges to make it a well directed film shooting in so many different kinds of locations\nYeah I think the ultimate question about what is it is not a well directed film is do you believe that do you believe you're watching Bradley Cooper or do you believe you're watching Jackson made if you think you're watching the actor you're not in a well directed movie if you are with the character\nYou were in a well directed moving there are certain different ways to achieve that and I think Bradley Cooper does that leave it and I think one of the things that he achieved really well is an immaculate but he talked about this the seeing this performance of shallow", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "10"}
