described her alleged sexual assault before Congress on Thursday women across the country and the world we're listening there were also talking\n... testimony brought to the surface difficult memories and sexual assault survivors who never shared publicly what happened to them started doing so at home on social media and workplaces\nIncluding ours\nMost of one a production team is female and most of them identify as sexual assault survivors one producer described her assault as a clear abuse of power she says at a previous job\nI had an entire he got me to go to his house on the pretense that I was getting instructions before watching his cat then he got me drunk kissed me and put her hand\nOn my chest another producer said her assailant was well known to her she told us it was after a night of drinking in high school\nBy an ex boyfriend I said no over and over but eventually it just let it happen I remember kind of retreating into myself and\nA federal thing on a corner of the ceiling like Christine Blasey Ford the women on our staff sometimes fixated on unexpected details one said the lights of passing cars or what\nRemember I was feeling so exposed and scared as they shown to the window of the car we were doing it in it hurts so badly and I burst into tears immediately after he was with another producer had to say he was a guy I had a crush on I remember

from our team it was an eighth\nGrade when I when I was actually assaulted at school by another student I told the dean of the middle school but no action was taken I saw my attacker almost every day until we moved away\nA few years later hearing these stories is like a gut punch I never would've imagined that so many of my colleagues were directly affected by assault and harassment let alone most of them\nI Am furious and frustrated that I Can't do anything to a race what they've been through these brilliant funny driven skilled women who do way more to make what happened that I ever have or will\nBut perhaps that theory and frustration or naive perhaps I should have assumed that at least some of them had been through it and perhaps you have to\nToday we'll explore this moment of

let me get to some of your stories and comments one member of the one eight tax club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and afraid of the dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to the doctor for his testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it the thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping\nBy the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today has to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you were more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids at a time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family\nAway from the kids at a time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words are the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board Mara welcome to the program\nThanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times an account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote I never felt compelled to share my story before because it is so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nUnremarkable what made you think of what you had been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\nYou know for years and my friends and I have been and colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of ours sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist who I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring doctor for its testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent on my own experience\nCan you share with us to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so and it was over\nFeel comfortable what happened to you sure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um\nYou know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think um we both had um an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was you know Twenty years old time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back at his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to 'em and it was very painful and I\nI'm often to stop and eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think ... frankly it was probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I find the time\nAnd you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nLast week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked\nConan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as the teenagers here is part of what professor Ford said\nIndelible in the hippocampus is the laughter ... the previous laughter between the two and they're having fun at my expense\nProfessor ten you explain for us from a neurological perspective what it is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus ... and what it does\n[noise] um the hippocampus has a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDoctor for it in her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are involved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm\nI'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that ... that fear about lying and immediately react\nWell escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on the brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the music or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really\nMakes my heart caught you know it's really emotional\nUm but forget other details like\nUh the house you were in or the neighborhood\nOther details like\nUh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of help explain it but it is yeah brain operate\nIt kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way he described it it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie or you know you walking drawn and house you'll forget all the decor but\nThat's the thing that leaked out at you that kind of forced your adrenalin to rise that wouldn't coach that as a great example yes\nNow more you said that a moment or cilia Loren I Believe or Lawrence Taylor these moments than coach so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or do you just kind of have to deal with those things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through the ups or ten\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm Talking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or a ... community support group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um\nWhat we do in our empowerment self defense classes\nAre is help people find their voice and find their physical power a talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but um as professor Conan will tell you\nThe trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of so magic um release of that and so mad at basically means so much as body so um we we do role plays of practicing standing up for yourself or\nWe we do role plays of practicing standing up for yourself or asking for what you want and we also do hitting and um that can be that can really move the trauma through an out your body or not only reclaiming your power but you're also releasing whatever you've been through\nLet me get to a

back\nNow to our conversation with Lawrence Taylor of defend yourself New York times journalist Marvin Gaye and Harvard University's terrorists and Conan we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into us\nMy name is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from that\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why it doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rate that left obvious marks it's easy to pretend it never happened and\nEmotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and several Gert and so is shame\nLive thanks very much for sharing your story with this market love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment that\nComes after an incident like that after an attack like that wow and it's powerful and you know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault\nNecessarily certainly not just because of of my assault a it was one of the things that many that that I dealt with but I have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nUm you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before I was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown and social research or you know that he's shame and vulnerability right and I I\nAm I've become a huge believer that shame needs secrecy to survive\nI'm an oath huge part of the reason I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I've been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs\n'em and no longer hold on to that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece about it they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around\nAnd that uh I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experiences as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really\nI just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of the embodiment of that injustice and\nThat's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from\nLark I just wanted to um that speak to what this\nWhat lives shared about her experience there are very\nHonorable powerful reasons not to tell I Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who makes the choice not to tell\n'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex terminal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job um but they are all very real\nAt at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college were sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nTop of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell some people what happened I was called a whore lucky because my rape\nWhat happened I was called a whore lucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others and I was called a complainer and people wonder why survivors don't come forward\nPat emailed when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist began molesting me he was thirty one\nHe told my mom he had some work I could do for him if you check patients in nursing homes he took me to pornographic movie theaters he taught me what a glory hole was he had a friend of his implant and I you'd be in this went on for almost two years\nMore on let me stick with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway who spoke this weekend about her own experiences with being assaulted listen\nI feel very empathetic frankly for victims of sexual assault sexual harassment\nAnd rate that [noise]\nI ... I don't expect and judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake or or any body to me how responsible for that responsible ... own kind that\nThat was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN learn what do you make it become\nWell first of all I'm Glad she came out as a survivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice ... it's a sign of Kellyanne Conway we none of us have ever seen before but she seems to put the blame entirely on herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that\nThe\nAggressor is the only person responsible for the harassment abuse or assault you can for where anything you want you can get is drunk as you want if there is not a rapist there you will not be rape\nYou can get is drunk 'cause we want if there is not a rapist there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's carrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry\nCarlos wrote on our Facebook page I Am a fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault by\nA man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day it is difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of this I rarely hug any one and I'm ... extremely protective of my daughters professor Conan would you react to that I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how\nThis might be playing out differently for male survivors of trauma versus women who have been traumatized\nThank you for bringing this up because I'm One of the things we haven't talked much about is that men are also victims of sexual abuse and assault um and that the effects on them I'm\nOf developing anxiety phobia pie TST are similar to that that women experience after being assaulted\nAnd I think for men who were victims of sexual assault if it's possible there's more stigma there is even more stigma in terms of being able to come out\nUm and um be heard um so I so in terms of how this is playing out I Wonder how men are feeling in term of do they feel and they identify with Dr Ford would they feel like their experiences are being\nNeglected um I think if more men um\nWho were able to and felt comfortable speaking out that actually it'd be really helpful to move the conversation you mentioned earlier about a men's involvement and I think people have mentioned hearing from ... male perpetrators but\nSeventeen you an army now in Ninety One place I take and see the al ... streaming in mind that K.

A. M. U. dot org we've been hearing from so many of you Elizabeth tweets why is the minimum wage a specific amount instead of a percentage tied to cost of living or some other figure measured and adjusted annually\nAnd we'll emails us from Cape Cod I have a small landscaping in gardening business with depending on the time of year six to ten employees all skilled gardeners\nI pay at least Eighteen dollars an hour and I support a higher minimum wage we're going to be talking about minimum wage and a living wage let's have Paul saw on a set the table for a little bit Paul the federal minimum wage\nIs just seven twenty five less than half of what Amazon is paying and what you can make in California starting in twenty twenty two hasn't been raised by Congress since two thousand and nine and its last ten percent of its purchasing power\nSince two thousand and nine and its last ten percent of its purchasing power or even since two thousand nine how many states huge to the seven twenty five\nMinimum ... there are about Twenty one states where the uh minimum wage is just seven twenty five um and then there's another group of about eight states where it's the wages is a little higher but still owe a nine dollars are lower\nUm but ah the other ... you know there's the other Twenty one states have um a you know stopped waiting for Congress to act and have have raise the minimum wage including a whole cluster of them that are raising it significantly to the twelve to Fifteen dollar an hour range [noise]\nOne of the the the key things on the minimum wage to understand is you know it's a it's been because of of the rule of money in politics and you know the congressional Republican leaderships refusal to um to to to allow any action on it um it's really become irrelevant at the federal level it's so low it's not doing its job to rate of raising pay\nAnd this is a real issue right now you know and it's a ... receiving increasing attention um you know we're in a booming economy jobs are growing but there's almost no wage growth jobs are barely keeping up with rice the rising cost of living\nThe one place where we're seeing wage growth workers at the bottom are in those states that are raising the minimum wage and that\nThat actually speaks to the point the important point that Mr ... and the caller raised about hey you know if some companies are raising pay may do we need a minimum wage\nBut the the data shows that while there are some leaders to really raise the floor and ... improve improve improve pay in our economy we need we need fair standards and the minimum wage has to be a lot higher and\nThe um you know things have gotten so out of whack that today close to one in three American\nThings have gotten so out of whack that today close to one in three Americans\nAre earning less than Fifteen dollars an hour that's um you know forty million workers the median age is thirty is thirty five\nYou know these are overwhelmingly adults who spend their careers and these jobs and it's you know it's it's not it's fast food but not just fast food it's jobs you know the jobs to make her economy run about you know one one for healthcare workers one in five educators you know\nHuge swaths of our economy of of our workforce are stuck in these jobs paying less than Fifteen dollars an hour\nAnd ... I I think it says a lot when you say that the minimum wages is laid down by Congress has almost irrelevant to the real economy because seven dollars and twenty five cents\nJust doesn't go anywhere or in most states in most localities and yet to have Congress advocating laws that are essentially irrelevant to how people really live\nA is a remarkable in ... and notable state of affairs necessary Europe proponent of a living wage and I and I read that tweet from one of our listeners who said why have a minimum wage why not index it essentially to a real life now what is the difference between a minimum wage and and what's become known as a living wage\nWell MIT has a living wage calculator where you can go on there and type thing where you live and it'll be a lotta number that's based on looking at the\nCost of local transportation food housing and other basic needs I looked up on the city I live in the district of Columbia they said the living wage there I was Seventeen dollars an hour but that's for fulltime work\nAnd I want to point out that a huge ... additional problem in addition to the low wages in this country is the increased\nProblem in addition to the low wages in this country is the increase in security if work how many people are working part time at Walmart it's half\nOf their employees are part time workers and then there's the temporary workers and the subcontracted workers you know Amazon Fifteen dollars an hour is not going to apply to their\nA contractor says the increased ... precarious ness of work that that's also a big problem eat despite are low unemployment we still have so many people working every day for poverty wages\nI'm Paul even though Fifteen dollars an hour is twice the current federal minimum as you mentioned we heard from a lot of listeners who say in this economic climate or even Fifteen doesn't go very far let's hear from some of them\nWent ahead and have a minimum wage to try to imagine that are for workers but whenever can catch up on a dog on a scale on land written a minimum wage and it's never enough\nAnd as a college graduate with a bachelor's degree and student loans I already make Fifteen dollars an hour at a fulltime job and have to supplement with at least one part time job at all times\nI think there needs to be some consideration on regional differences because I can assure you that Fifteen dollars an hour in South Carolina goes much further than Fifteen dollars an hour in California\nI work another job besides my full time job and uh so I Am kind of like we think by but unfortunately I have lots of the credit card debt as a result and uh actually like Eighteen dollars an hour to twenty four a fulltime job would probably be closer to my but\nPaul we hear from a lot of listeners there who were living on minimum wage and for many many more this has been a big issue in Congress or workers who work for big companies can't afford healthcare don't have insurance wind up relying on state or federal public assistance to make up the difference\nRelying on state or federal public assistance to make up the difference and that suggests that all of us in some way are subsidizing low wages\nYou're you're exactly right and I mean you're ... and as or your callers I mean\n... if you look at cost of living data you see that in all fifty states or a single worker will need at least Fifteen dollars an hour to cover the basics in just a couple of years\nAnd in the high cost states the your your your listeners were flogging or workers with children will need even more than Fifteen dollars an hour we have a report on our website by ... P. I. N. T. O. on this with the with the numbers for all fifty states and uh\nIt really highlights how Fifteen is really a basic national floor and we need to even go up from there like a you know you know in New York New Jersey did this week we're airport workers are getting a raise to Nineteen dollars an hour\nAnd hotel workers are are striking around the country in the higher costs that he's demanding twenty five dollars an hour or so you know your workers or your your listeners are right about about about what you know as a practical matter if you do the math what individuals need to to to get by especially in the higher cost regions\nAnd as a result you know a lot of ... of of companies big and small are relying on our taxpayer funded safety net for support you know more than a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year of safety net programs go to a workers in low paying jobs and you know these are good programs and we should have them but we need\nYou know major employers to do their part to pay a decent wage of at least Fifteen dollars an hour and then to supplement that with a with work supports in order to help bring bring workers up to a a basic level now let's hear some of the other side of the Seth writes to us on Facebook when I worked for Walmart\nSome of the other side of the Seth writes to us on Facebook when I worked for Walmart we were all excited when they raised our wages to ten dollars and fifty cents but then they cut ours to barely twenty hours a week then told us if we even had to have an open schedule we would get even less I'm skeptical of individual companies\nThat are raising wages and we received also a lot of calls from people who were concerned that raising the federal minimum wage to say Fifteen dollars an hour could wind up backfiring on workers\nI'm all for making you know Fifteen dollars an hour at the job I'm at now I work at ... in the mall but I find that a lot of people are a lot of employers\nThey're raising the hourly wage or just cutting down hours which in the end it either arrows stem from the previous\nUh wage or in some cases you make let\nI'm opposed to raising it to Fifteen dollars an hour simply because I don't think businesses will take that last they will raise the prices the standard of living raise and Fifteen dollars won't get anyone anything the poor will stay for\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Boehner with the bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractor is committed to expertise and the customer service\nContract to locate her and more information or a donor dot com and from the Brown University school of professional studies with executive master's degrees for mid career professionals in the fields of business cyber security health care and science and technology leadership\nCyber security health care and science and technology leadership brown dot edu slash NPR\nLooking back to ... with you today I'm\nSorry I ... I I Want to talk about a fight going on in Washington DC where we happened to be in a one eight studios at WAMC you enter the world [laughter] unfortunately increasingly so but there has been a very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington is a world knows it but D.C as locals know\nThere was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grassroots\nResistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others um voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting\nThis very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue or what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for ... workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the rest in in ones and hopefully five ...\nThe way I see it this week the living wage movement to three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen and they took one big step back with the DC Council voting to repeal um that that will last\nDC Council voting to repeal um the the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers um\nFederally than minimum wage protect workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for a couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents\nTechnically if you don't make enough tips to bring that a wage up to the the um the local minimum your employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color\nOr at a job where people face ramping sexual harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customer say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really a A N E L a wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system um the industry launched an incredible campaign against it they put posters up everywhere in the city saying save our tips to try to make people think that the said something to do with banning tips\nIt did not it was clearly be beyond a local issue this was a national showdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this vulnerable sector of the workforce\nOr Michael Saltsman what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this are the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters who is remarkable but what about the economics of it will actually so\n... is remarkable but what about the economics of it well actually so I I think in this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it went until three twenty in the morning um and the number of employees who showed up to say\nThis is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far outnumbered those where they are supporting and I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage in in DC is is is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employees in DC\nUh according to the bureau of Labor Statistics are in with their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are\nAlready doing quite well and what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the tips made when among wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employees who said\nWe want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group of New York based group called rock they didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money that come in to try and put this issue\nOn the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring from employees hundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees that you say you say grass roots and I'm I'm sure that you're right but grass roots are astro turf we see so much grass roots in the area of wages and minimum wage is only to find out that the grassroots workers who were fighting\nWages only to find out that the grassroots workers who are fighting against increases in wages are are backed by business center\nAs well so actually I I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proponents is is is a little bit um demeaning to the workers who who came forward um because the the testimony they gave it you know one forty five in the morning or the people who got up a at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be harmful to me this is going to be harmful to my industry\nDon't try and save me I'm not asking for it I mean I think that the the the the notion I think that these people are just doing that um because they're sort of put up to it or somehow that they're not real employees\nUm I I think it's kind of insulting to what they're trying to do in a film and they'll send a the chairman Phil Mendelson to chair the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got us to talk about this which is that he said\nI have heard from countless employees who tell me this is not good for them I have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep it and he said people can come to me privately they can email me this is not an issue of their owners being intimidated\nHe said that the grassroots on this in support of it was silent he called them the silent grassroots and I think that's that's indicative of where the passion was on this issue let's pull back\nFrom the district the district of Columbia the local D.C back out to the nation at large and so many of you won a listeners\nHad been reaching out to us Nina posts on Facebook I'm In a precarious position if my wages go up I won't be eligible for Medicaid so it's a wash or worst for me we talked about free riders and how many workers who get minimum wage is wind up on public assistance\nAnd Randy in Tulsa emails advocates are correct Amazon Walmart McDonalds and the other giants can afford Fifteen dollars for a minimum wage but the local donut shop the ...\nCan afford Fifteen dollars for a minimum wage but the local donut shop the mom and pop floors those businesses will be hurt it's just another blow against main street\nNo sir I Want to talk to you about income inequality and we're in minimum wage fits into this we hear so much about the growing wealth gap in massive income inequality in this country we talk about the shrinking of the middle class but at the low end of the pay scale can increases in minimum wage actually provide\nAny real equity or is it just a drop in the bucket in a world where the top one percent on fifty percent of\nIts meaningful but in some ways it as a drop in the bucket you know a couple of years ago two of my colleagues calculated that three men the three wealthiest men in America including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have combined wealth that his graders and the combined wealth of the bottom half of the country\nAnd today that's an understatement because Jaffe as well as increased so much but nevertheless to dramatize is just how extreme the wealth gap is and I think there's a lot of interest in\n'em adding to the fight for Fifteen efforts to look not just that the low end of the wage scale but also the top and what can we do to prevent these really obscene levels of income and wealth concentration at the top that are so damaging to our economy our democracy\nNot to mention just a moral outrage and in a country that that is so wealthy\nAnd so I'm really excited about a new tool we have for doing this this year for the first time in history publicly held companies have to report the gap between their CEO and their worker pay the numbers coming out are staggering at Walmart\nWorker pay the numbers coming out are staggering at Walmart it's a thousand to one at at McDonalds it's three thousand to one\nAnd we can build on that information to incentivize companies to to narrow there gaps and just one quick example Portland, Oregon introduced the world's first tax penalty on companies that pay their CEO\nMore than one hundred times their median worker pay this year they're going to put the revenue from that into homeless services and it'll hit companies like Wells Fargo and\nAnd Wal Mart that do business in the city of Portland I think ideas like that are going to start to spread like wildfire now that we have this information about gaps within specific company\nAnd an interesting set of proposals at a time when populism is strong\nIn our political culture both on the left and on the ride and workers voices and income inequality becoming a much more important part of the conversation you certainly see a lot of pushback from corporate America I think Bernie would be down Alexandria a cashew Cortez New York would they do the strong\nAcross America or angry and history tells us that now would be a good time to pay attention\nWMU and NPR in Washington this is one a [noise]\nEither I've taught swelling in for Joshua Johnson today on one age the power of anger women everywhere are ditching the

S. open here's a cut I'll bring you back there to refresh my memory\nOf anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos\nOf anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n[noise]\nSuresh from Shawnee you shared this moment along with the rest of America is arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who found that anger or weaponized against her\nAh yes I ... I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany in Tribeca and I have been talking about it was interesting because\nThere are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she\nShe was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the U. S. open I Believe\nAnd so in that moment there were two very distinct sponsors of the responses of the people\nThat really just wanted to see her in isolation acting um it and this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of\nThe power dynamics in the moment and the history and the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced\nAnd so I think that one thing that has been\nUnexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nTitle nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict um what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine in the lessons of title nine ... we tend to think of it as\nUm athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry\nI think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political live\nThere were some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper\nI don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova as response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said Martina speaking now\nSaid yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards but Serino was wrong her encore behavior was inappropriate paraphrasing just because men raging umpires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right and a champion Serena should not emulated\nI'm Martina Navratilova was wrong or she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it at the moment of solidarity she tried aletha Rena conduct as a lifelong fan um\nThere's a moment of solidarity she tried police arenas conduct\nI'm as a lifelong tennis fan I'm I Am limited but Martina Navratilova reminded me but up until this moment\nMost white women in tennis have not been allies of the Williams sisters um ... when I watch tennis with my friends who are African American tennis fan we often talk about watching these matches on you because of the micro aggressions that come from white women\nWho are often knocking at the Williams sisters and having things to say but let me also add\nThat one of the things that was most infuriating about watching the way in which Ramos treated Serena\nWas that there was a broader context to her anger not only did he accused her of cheating but this also came out on the heels of reports that members of the u._s. TA had been showing up to her house\nUnannounced and testing her over and over again on grounds that maybe she was doping even though she has come clean on every drug tested even those statistics show that they were testing her double the amount that they were testing any other players on the women's side and so she had been subjected to repeated and dignity\nAnd then as the best tennis player of her generation and perhaps ever see them has a referee\nWho accuses her cheating and she's one more grand slam that any woman other than Margaret Court and any woman in the open era and that is indicative of the kinds of fury that we're talking about the ways that women are disrespected daily have\nWith artists musicians and dancers inspired by and Britain in\nDetail that Nevada art dot org [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the main office of tourism\nOffering traveled there is an opportunity to explore and discover their very own main thing to be inspired be original and be yourself at visit main dot com\nAnd from Newman's Own foundation working to nourish the common good by donating all profits from Newman's Own food products to charitable organizations that seek to make the world a better place more information is available at Newman's Own foundation dot org\n[noise] on the odds were like sitting in for Joshua Johnson we're talking about the power of women's anger in the current moment in America where I'm Talking with Rebecca Traister for New York magazine and the ... author of good and bad Britney Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage and also ...\nRutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage and also ... director of the women's media center speech project and\nAuthor of the new book rage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment that said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment\nOf Hillary Clinton and the twenty sixteen campaign and I want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for\nNavigating the shoulders of how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton has a history of being\nVery careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America and in fact it was news in the two thousand and eight campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle and a half\nSo now a lotta people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was tone police listen\nI regret deeply\nHow angry\nTone of the campaign became [noise] not\nYour fault says one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately in that in Hillary fashion says I regret how nasty the campaign became um ... just this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's\nLaughing here in the studio with me but how does that strike you [laughter] so she was off as she was she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting on it I mean\nI think it was um\n... I mean I think it was um\nIt was ridiculous that this woman was called an authentic well being held to the standard\nOf care full control in her voice and her facial of parents and her body\nAnd her motive expression I mean the two candidates um that were her primary opponents for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they could pound ...\nYou know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card ride there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\n... is so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton\nBoth Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political pressed for their particular skill in channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift they were able to give voice to this frustration and we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet\nEvery time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ex ... a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough sad smile is if it was like some\nThe nights you won a primary and Joe Scarborough said smile is if it was like some cat color on the street smile more um she was told that regularly and I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in our own memory of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her\nAnd how menacing and aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but then she was thinking no no no\nThat's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad it's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us is about how much energy\nWomen expend modulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective\nAnd and I think that that's something that that all three of us who are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expressions\nI Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last ... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger goes because this is a moment\nSome of this anger goes because this is a moment in America and let's be realistic moments have a way of fading they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nMaybe the cameras and all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Britney Cooper are not as interested anymore you know in a in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many want listeners I Want to play you another mash up of some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling\nMy name's Aaron I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania Sarah from Cincinnati when I met my anger bubble over and I get really angry out loud it\nReally doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as being angry are overreacting women yelling even in this day and age that very acceptable\nMen don't seem to have that same problem and I'm\nStarting to feel like maybe it's not just a personal issue I'm dealing with what's going to be nice and and uh and keep our mouth shut however I Am so angry so angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm turning my anger\nInto action gets it helped that feel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging I think that's what when that happens you have to take that anger hold on to it\nAnd that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from listeners women who it feels like there's a team or transferring\nSome of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action industry is taking action maybe at the ballot box we got this tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville I'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office\nI'm running for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on my determination to be a voice for all and focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracey as one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important\nHe says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation a Brittany Cooper I Want to talk about where this goes in terms of maybe the midterms that might be the most immediate effect I'm a\nNone of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any\nPollster or political analyst worth anything is looking down and what they called the cross tabs and noticing that women are mad women are going to vote and women are going to form a tidal wave in twenty Eighteen one way or the other\nAbsolutely and that is as it should be um I'm particularly heartened by\nThe Stacey Abrams campaign down in Georgia we have the opportunity to have the first black woman I'm governor of a state of a former slave state or the ... Presley campaign they're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing we've been seeing that since twenty sixteen we had a wave of\nA progressive as sort of radically progressive black mayors in the deep south\nAnd so one of the things that I Want to challenge folks to do as we think in this moment is to actually look at what people of color are doing not just women but particularly black women in these elections\nThe ways that we have that channeling our anger on for decades and decades and that started with the way that we voted for Hillary Clinton in this most immediate political moment um but to your earlier point about whether or not\nOur anger can be sustained\nUm I think that I think that this can be sustained I think that we have to remember that the women's movement in this country do it goes through ebbs and flows has really been a solid political project uh since uh depending on how you count Eighteen thirty one or Eighteen forty eight\nSo we're we're two hundred years in a almost here and so I think you know I'm I think that there is a real opportunity for us to make some change here and I think that as women see that\nUm I think that there is a real opportunity for us to make some change here and I think that as women see that\nUm our power and our ability to frame issues in ways that include the most American and take care of the most marginalized American um I I'm I'm excited about a way of what I what I Hope though is that folks start to see that even if you don't care a lot about presidential politics", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "03"}
