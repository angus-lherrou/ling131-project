Rebecca parish being Lou\n... Charles the story was followed by Kevin Shaw I mean I found a little bit with Charles but that's really Kevin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry being that that followed a Charles a story and they had to establish these kinds of relationships\nUm that important now the moment you're talking about is with tiara that's actually a story I happened to be falling and you know if you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with her because she was struggling with a lot of things at that time I felt was relevant to include that in the film\nA few more of your comments before we bring in our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we fail to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period end of sentence agility for fun\nAmerica period end up sentence\nAgility for fun tweeted I've watched every episode of America to me I absolutely love it I'm shocked at how clueless and the white teachers are especially that physics teacher\nThe school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the news of full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Steve associate for his thoughts on the series we did not get a response but that invitation remains open we also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school Nathan rouse\nWe were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit\nFor courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary either is that right see that's right\nWhat's that seem more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmanda Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy\nAt the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called despite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to say thanks I had any also with us here at W. B. easy as David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is a Chicago native professor still Volkow thanks so much that have professors have you watched the series any part of it some of it all there yes\nFestival what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest\nThing that struck me the hardest as an episode to win one of the parents\nThis is an episode to win one of the parents\nOf student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the empty conversation that we do not have about schools that have the illusion of integration and I said the illusion of integration because it just means that students of color are in the same place with white students\nWhen this mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he's still happening today that to me is the story of us ... professor Lewis what about you\nKnow one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in the series but I think one of the things that all the struck me as the silences some of the some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate and who wasn't\nOne of the things you notice in that district is that the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families a key leaders and the district a lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like\nA opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on in the district\nBy the way for those of you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you were eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so do that in mind in the conversation if you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them please do not tweeting me [laughter] 'cause I ruin this film for you I don't want to hear it\nBut if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety at the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a duck\nDot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org we're talking about racial equity professor still vote what does that mean what does racial equity looked like is it making sure\nThat black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people feel being nice to one another like how would we know racial equity if we had it\nRight I mean I think this is and thank you for that question I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to him and his point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution so when you talk about redistribution so now the question becomes who has had the least\nNow what are those things that they talk about that they meet the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they need it and I think is ... is the issue ...\nGive me an example of getting people what they need when they need\nA young person says we have a particular problem with this teacher who is constantly giving us disciplinary referrals\nConstantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious now there needs to be so that racial equity team at the schoolhouse whoever that is\nThat person needs to be in the conversation that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people which often happens in school houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition professor Lewis ... ... what\nDo you find that the big barriers to advancing toward racial equity is it is that funding is that the people involved is it different for every school in every district what tends to get in the ...\nWell I'm going to talk about the parks at the world\nAnd to get in the ... well I'm going to talk about the parks at the world and there are a lot of them and I think one of the things that um my colleague John Diamond and I found when we were doing the research for our book\nWas that when you really try to understand why changes so hard it really is especially in these kinds of communities\nAbout folks who have a lot of resources that have been served well by those districts for a long time not wanting change to happen and we talk about this is a kind of form of opportunity hoarding\nBut it's a way of trying to decide how race works today differently than it worked in the past in the past we might have said you can't be in my class or we're going to have separate schools all this kind of things today we had this of near of racial integration and we what we do instead is create these racially segregated academic hierarchies within schools and the schools themselves\nPlay a big role in creating them and then a lot of the white families and the power families in these districts play a big role and making sure that they don't go away\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Americans for the arts committed to transforming America's communities through the arts and

questions tomorrow from Atlanta on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors amend the Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one eight ... how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother tax club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to rent myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white and\nYet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like advanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way\nTen push too far that we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make it\nTo me I I mean it's not in a a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue and not pushing far enough right when we talk about equity\nWe have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity and then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one why student did not get one scholarship does not mean that\nBlack and Latino students across the country do not are not chemically denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve that's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction that I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to parse out three actions that that finally\nWell I've I've not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdote experiences is that a lot of white audiences are people\nMy anecdotal experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience if for no other reason than there are other reasons is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not living in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all\nOf the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some of my past work and I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white parents\nCharles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for anyone's high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin does that reflect your experience and off my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general like there's kind of lie\nHer essay is there's this blanket we put over white kids as like your you know they always going to be warm regardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color there's like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of the sleeping bags but we ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who's also feature documentary where like\nI wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to compare saying the other students but the school has like\nI I didn't want to compare saying the other students but the school has like I guess prominent interest in us because of what we do without extra curricula is and so it was just already saying that they're like okay well we need to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who is in in any extra curricular lose who doesn't have any type of\nUm non student teacher relationship with any adult in the building they like it's hard to get you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there is Lincoln's vice sleeping bags whereas like\nAll other white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have states in the school the parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever and then you got the kids who I mean like meat luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to oh the but\nOther than that right it was not really so you kind of have to fend for yourself exactly and we like it that's just not the case you know I think it goes to showing 'em which episodes that we must have done it was like most of the kids and his honors um tutoring sessions are usually white and are widely so yeah All right and that's that's part like you know\nPersonal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to ... on his tutoring but that's just the one right that you know so\nTo that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor Lewis carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for it\nThe reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years [noise]\nYou know it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you could take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like Evanston like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens of these kinds of districts\nThat tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts we take kids that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in\nAnd we track them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kids are in higher attracts get more they get better they get better teaching and so we take kids that might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time and so\nWhen we look at schools like a park as Dave said earlier\nThe structures that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks um are inevitably going to uh take\nRacial disparities that exist in all our society and and reproduce them in our schools and that this ... the troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how these trucks get created and if you look at the history of the really deep racist history of tracking and general\nRace also becomes explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational spaces in school or Ninety percent white and the least advantaged educational experience you know a places in the same exact school are predominantly black\nShould have us all up in arms about the fact that we think that that's OK is all about our racial mythology I think we also have to ask questions about\nToday it's all about our racial mythology I I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and what a good education is and you know I've heard a PE teachers including Ty Williams the black or a teacher in the series\nLament the fact that it's a piece students often just want to be given the information they need to score well on the test that's what they want they're not really that interested in learning they just ... it's a game it's an important\nGame I mean in terms of a larger kind of a ... as an editor for vacation like having a more well read learned ...\nSome of the some of the most interesting and I think for far reaching in deep teaching was going on at lower levels which is not to excuse the system that man is talking about\nBut we just we define being educated in such narrow ways it's about ACT scores and GPA's and that you know and that's what we defined as being an educated person well\nI hear you on that Steve but at the same time you know I think about I'm not trying to excuse the sooner no I I hear that I hear that though I ... I Wonder though professor still while I think about you know kids who grow up in in refer parts of town that have been told your ticket out as your education\nBroadcasting from the University of Nevada Reno based in eighty eight point seven in Ninety One point seven KU when are we now in Ninety One point by paying the the L ... seemingly became an R. dot org [noise]\nIt's nine o'clock Donald Trump built an image as a self made billionaire an image that helps him win the presidency [noise] how does that image match up with the facts and what impact might that have\nFrom W.

reporting about Donald Trump after he declared himself to be a Kennedy\nIt it was we I'm In late two thousand and a sixteen I was mailed three pages of Donald Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax returns and all of his reporting as sort of been in one way or another you know just an outgrowth of our\nOur study of his taxes and and and those talks in particular showed something very interesting which was not your Donald Trump at a loss of almost a billion dollars it was a huge number and it essentially gave him a bit of a gift card from the IRS allowed him to shelter\nA almost a billion dollars going forward um and we learned then six months later we thought you know these losses were so huge\nAnd then in March to thousands Seventeen\nThree more pages of his tax returns um are found um released on the Rachel Maddow show and they showed that he made a hundred and fifty million dollars\nThat year this was for two thousand five and this thing started with a simple question which is how

discussion on the New York times investigation we wanted to update you on the investigation of suspicious packages that have turned up around the country in the past few days\nA series of pipe bombs were mailed or delivered by careers to top democratic figures from LA to New York to Washington the bombs were wrapped in bubble wrap in manila envelopes\nThey're attain tended recipients according to the mailings included Hillary and Bill Clinton Iraq Obama Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder democratic donor George Soros democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters\nFormer CIA director John Brennan an actor Robert De Niro all of them have been vocal critics of President Trump\nAt least one package had a district office of Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz listed as its return address shields as the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee it bounced back\nBack to that district office when it failed to reach its intended recipient Eric Holder\nThe bomb that was sent to John Brennan was sent and care of CNN studios on Columbus Circle in New York when it was discovered the entire CNN building the time Warner center was evacuated\nAnd the FBI says additional packages may have been mailed elsewhere and initial examination shows that at least five of the bombs are rudimentary but functional\nNone of the bombs detonated on site and no one has been hurt as far as we know\nNow President Trump urged unity during the White House press conference yesterday\nThe full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United states of America [noise]\nDuring a rally in Wisconsin and in a tweet the president once again urged unity but he also blame the press for supposedly stoking political divisions this morning the president tweeted quote\nA very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news and it's gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean\nFast unquote\nThis story is moving very fast and again there's still a lot that we do not know including who is behind the suspicious devices and what

investigation comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThat common with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder\nHow your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes\nBut didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two I mean it it it comes into the hundreds\nOf millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various tax authorities that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had and the various kind of larger Trump family\nThat they had in the various kind of larger Trump family organization when they sold the business ... business is off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more than devaluation can you give us a sense Susanna how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of ... writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a\nValuations of you know five ten million\nBut on the same hand when they had a charitable donation um where they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go high they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nOf course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS then that compromise is the amount of tax and the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking\nWhether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich after the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone riches\nAnd paradise papers I just assume everyone riches engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer rough [laughter]\nThose were there was a very good questions I there are some of these some of the things that we are talking about here that we uncovered are um trust arrangements that the IRS endorsed sometimes after being pushed by\nA U.S trust in a state attorney ... I'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them this grants or retained annuity trust which is a formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump and his siblings took ownership of their fathers empire in the nineties\nThere's actually a commercial video the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of an pad invoices so Don Trump and his siblings could start\nA taking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kinda things aren't a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we are talking about here and even in cases where\nThey used a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people\nThat Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in a state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers before we get into more of the details late to get one more\nWe get into more of the details I'd like to get to one more comment that were sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the Trump actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs Jeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people have received benefits and their father I see this is a story the second part is taxes avoided\nThat is illegal method of reducing your tax bill through existing a statute taxes evaded now that would be interesting but so far as I hear is that he use certain ... to avoid paying taxes as we all do we all take adoption standard or otherwise\nJeff thanks for sharing your thoughts with us Susanna what would you say to Jeff\n...\nThe top I mean these aren't standard deductions one at one of the um one of the things that we wrote about the ... you mentioned um was a company that was set up it's it's interesting 'cause it's true that the rich due to a lot of things to avoid taxes the trumps cross the line into illegality and one of the companies\nThat we wrote about um this company called all county building supply\nIt was set up in Nineteen Ninety to its sole purpose was to to fraud the ... the IRS to avoid taxes what it was it was a fairly simple mechanism and explain it and and I think reader or your listeners can kind of come to their ... to a conclusion on it\nFor a Trump in in the early Nineteen nineties was getting old he had a ton of buildings he had a lot of cash 'em and the Trump siblings were looking at a situation if Fred Trump died where they would have to pay at the time it would have been a fifty five percent at state tax on all the cash that his buildings were sitting on we are talking\nSupport for NPR comes from the station\nAnd from American University's ... school

A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this\nIs their job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on this\nIt it is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout the story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff\nDoes get through 'em and I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality of\nThe or the ... that we saw we do see I'm In some of the things\nSaw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS get pushed back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did\nUm you understand when when the IRS does see something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement and we we saw that additional toxins certain things was paid when they saw valuations\nThat they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled in in in things move on in the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS um I well county as the company where they had they were putting the voices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire an in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the trumps we're doing there so it's sort of a ... a mix of they caught some stuff in and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Russ have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late are are there statute of limitations that are involved there are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those have since told\nThere is if there's fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS\nWe wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nI've heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities who say based on ah the the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Sudan which said ...\nUm ... it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been fifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would've had to pay some talks that would've been a business tax\nUm and it would have been substantially less and it's interesting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not pay tax on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them pay but it would have been substantially less than the fifty five percent state tax that they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of missed the kinds of stands out is it how Fred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips and one of Donald Trump's failed casinos can can you explain that\nTo us so that was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing\nIn Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a payment on a bond basically a money he own oath to lenders um and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos\nHis father is a lawyer showed up with checks totaling three and a half million dollars\nBought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and and never cash them so that was an eventually determined to be an illegal loan that Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if ... in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to full for civil law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they've really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with our county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs\nOnto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflate that they they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it that potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not so there's a range of things um and now you could be\nSo there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um they're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalties in interest on the money the toad so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities I'm another authorities could be looking at um where the\nFood they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n... ...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who would choose to prosecute the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents with a state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd if those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners some if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our other listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father\nAs he stated where exactly is the discrepancy none Suzanne ...\nComments I had one one thing that when when we started out Donald Trump has\nHas stated that he started with a million dollar loan and he built it into a billion dollar empire he's now in the White House and he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made\nBillionaire um there is no evidence necessarily that he is a billionaire but what we showed is that he inherited hundreds of millions of dollars over his lifetime from his father um and some of that\nHis lifetime from his father um and some of that was done through tax fraud\nPeople may or may not care about that but I think it's an important\nUm narrative of of somebody now in the White House about how he got his fortune in where the money came from it doesn't necessarily\nUm say he didn't get revenue or money from other areas you know there's been stories that some of it has come from Russia but what we showed is that much more of that came from his father um over his lifetime and that he was willing to cross the line um to shelter from having to pay taxes I think that's an important chapter in the president's life that\nTen o'clock [noise] headlines for not\nAn act of terror people coast to coast including to living presidents targeted with suspicious packages where does the investigation stand

accidental casualty however her fiance was a gi argue employee whose mother was also a high level G R U operative\nWhen she tried to reach her fiance from the hospital he and his mother disappear also interesting and it goes on to write also interesting that the two alleged hit men flew on the same flight as the daughter to London considering that scruples wife and son died earlier somewhat suddenly it\nSeems that the poisoning when the daughter was visiting was not an accident the big question in my mind is this an operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level

way had died but it's still supposed that she had come in twenty Eighteen to be with her dad at that time because it would be a difficult time because it was a time they were all normally together as
