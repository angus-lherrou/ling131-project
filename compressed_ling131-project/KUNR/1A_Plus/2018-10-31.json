that many news organizations tend to focus on\nWill explain this project more in a moment but first let's talk about what's happening across America right now and that's early voting early voting is surging we're still about a week out from the election and millions of voters have already cast ballots maybe including you we asked you whether you had voted early and why and here is some of what you told us\nMy name is Jan I've lived for forty five years in Glenwood Springs Colorado\nI completed my ballot today it arrived in the mail and submitted it the following day\nMy name is Ali yeah I live in Houston, Texas I early vote\nOr because of the convenience this is Mary I'm from Birmingham, Alabama and I went down to the county courthouse Jefferson County courthouse filled out a request for an absentee ballot because we don't have early voting in Alabama and I was able to vote right\nThere I have never in my life voted early because I have never lived in the state that had early voting my name is Jessica I Am calling from Grand Rapids Michigan\nThis election is important and I feel like my voice needed to be heard so instead of just letting a day come and go wow I Am

first of all by early voting are we talking about people showing up at a collective polling place or people mailing in mail in ballots or all of it what do we mean\nOf those so other really three different types there's absentee voting that takes place in in most states where you just need an excuse and and sometimes those excuses had been been loosened for people a ... male and voting which

Clark is the program director at Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor Michigan she's also the co host of its program it's just politics so we welcome Joshua joining us from UNC public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is reporter Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happened to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them\nIn the weeks and months to come but let me start with three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas with regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth ... in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase or over the last midterm elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges has an angel watching just 'cause turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during presidential election so we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTony fourteen we had six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds for like sixty percent increase here in this day\nMichael do you want to what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nIt's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them that we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day on election day\nAnd people can register all the way up until election day and on election day and um uh it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots\nAnd Brian agreement what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's there's there's many of the counties across the state of reporting a\nRecord or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they are Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting in them or they're saying requests in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county by near Kansas City uh they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nBrian let me stick with you how does early voting worked in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through out of Kansas handle voting early\nIt depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um obviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request and you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas uh we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters would like to take that option we heard from\nAcceptable to to to voters would like to take that option we heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research a candidate amendment or proposition at leisure while completing the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado house has early voting work\nWell basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you you got to do a lot of research in Colorado this year it is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here in Colorado and\nFill out that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or\nOr some other kind of relaxing recreational kind of a cup of tea my whatever you want to be what what\nExactly um you know and so uh you know a lot of people I'm like this system in Colorado but not everyone um you know that ... ... ... the world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um now you got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting\nGlad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off by which your ballot has to be received November sixth tens and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nSix times and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nBut in every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the David ... has to be in a blue mailbox so that is something I Want to remind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand on election day not a postal carriers hands on election day\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day ... do you have to lie\nTo vote early in Michigan for all practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town\nLet's say a and there are folks that go and say I'm going to be out of town\nAnd and lie there are also some other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be a over sixty years old or another is maybe due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment or trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot ...\nWhat is being over six do you have to do with voting early\nAh possibly to make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is a there are long waits let's say for example in the city of\nDetroit it's gonna be cold and maybe the idea is that if you know you don't want to Seventy eight year old having to to sit outside let's say in a wheelchair for three four hours and wait to vote so that is one a one way that that you can get an absentee ballot\nWas being silly Clark program director at Michigan Radio based in Ann Arbor\nWe're speaking to silly Clark program director at Michigan Radio based in Ann Arbor Michael do you want to an investigative reporter was K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado and Brian ... who covers energy and the environment for ... M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas\nRicky tweeted I early voted because I have an hour commute and a twelve hour a day on Tuesdays I liked being able to look up all of the issues and candidates I was more informed and took more time with my ballot voting from home\nAmen to that ... I have done the exact same thing especially living in California where our voter guide was about as big as I think one if not two of the hobbit novels like stacked on top of one of it was a ridiculously fit guide and it just took a little time to go through so I hear you on that\nTracey is listening from Texas and Tracy emailed I cast my ballot first thing on the first day of early voting because no one ever knows what may blow up and getting your way hello Harvey\nReferring to that hurricane that hit the Gulf Coast last year interested so he let me speak with you for a minute about what issues voters are fired up about particularly those that are showing up at the polls early\nThat's on the way at nine right here on gay you win our eighty eight point seven\n...\nSupport

worthwhile question especially after last weekend's mass shooting in Pittsburgh and it's a question on the mind of the Reverend Adam Hamilton\nAnd it's a question on the mind of the Reverend Adam Hamilton he's founding pastor of the nation's largest Methodist Church back in Nineteen Ninety he founded the church of the resurrection in Lee would Kansas that suburb of Kansas City the goal was to attract what he calls thinking Christians with little or no engagement in their faith\nToday it has more than twenty thousand members across four campuses it's considered one of the most influential mega churches in the nation\nPasser Hamilton says that he has observed deep divisions within his congregation that reflect the nation's divides what's his plan to get people of faith thinking differently\nWe discussed it this summer when we were both in Aspen, Colorado for this year's Aspen Ideas festival here's the first part of our conversation Josh what's great to be with you today thank you describe your congregation United Methodist church of the resurrection in leave would Kansas or\nTell us about your congregation and we'll leave it as a suburb of Kansas City we've got four campuses throughout Kansas City is a downtown Kansas City Missouri was friends with her in a couple and the Kansas on\nAnd it's a very diverse congregation so highly educated largely a highly educated we have um we did a poll that long ago we found out that forty nine point two five percent of our people are Republicans and fifty point seven five percent of our people are divided between independents and Democrats\nThe Republicans are divided between conservatives and ... you know conservatives on social issues and those were moderate progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally\nBut Democrats are largely moderate to a progressive and the independence are divided between Republican leaning independents and democratic leaning independent so we're we're pretty divided congregation and I think we represent the country you know fairly well they're kind of divided within divisions ... exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious\nThe holidays exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader speak about the issues that are happening in the world you know I'd I constantly have not constantly but I regularly get emails from folks saying well you know you're being too political I Wish you wouldn't talk about politics and and I have to say okay wait a minute I'm not standing endorsing candidates I'm not even talking about the candidates\nBut what you're calling politics I'm calling ethics and morals and values when we're talking about\nJustice issues we're talking about people who are being hurt\nWe're talking about moral issues we're talking about ... and so if you think about what forms or politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on you know in radio sponsor TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper sense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely and I pray that\nWhen you're doing your politics\nYou're doing that through the lens of a deeper moral system in the value system\nHow much do you as a as a pastor as a minister lean into the political debates\nAnd a religious lens on them as opposed to trying to have times where you may be lean away from them like I imagine there are some weeks where you think let's just do a sermon on you know typing Orland I just do a sermon on actually the story of the guard and to be anything but pilots yeah\nSo here's a so for the folks who are upset by it they feel like I'm doing all the time\nBut here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week and in particular in this in the Trump era\nThere's always some you know big thing that's happened in the last week I Would be rewriting my sermon every ... every Saturday based on what happened in the news that week and then probably Sunday Morning fan and again probably something morning and so what I said it's a that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance and yet somewhere in the midst of those\nDance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance and yet somewhere in the midst of those is preaching on these themes the things that are happening in the news are going to come into play\nBut my ... isn't that a I mean I I think\nPeople are hearing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to church I'm not sure they always need one more year round of what they're already getting every day\nSo what I'm trying to do is is carefully choosing where one of the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be said when there's a school shooting\nAnd even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the ... into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or one of the issues we're facing in our society and then we're going to take a look and see how\nYou know for it to be a sermon and not just a an ethical lick electron ethics\nWe're gonna look to see how the scripture speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things and when I Try to do the approach I tried to take us to say okay I Know we are divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we are going to try to understand what might be the truth in this complex moral issue that this one side has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation and I'm going to say now you know with all the humility I can muster you can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but as I see this issue right now [noise]\nGun guns is a is a great example of this and uh recently I've preached the sermon on gun violence in schools I did a sermon on a on gun control and and gun legislation to a year ago\nAnd as I did that you know I surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense\nAnd as I did that you know I surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measures that one can take to um to address the prevalence of guns and how easy access to them and and it was interesting how how many people agreed on both the left and the right on some of these basic things\nNow that sounds like potentially risky ground because it begins to get out of spirituality in actual policy yeah um\nDoes actually so so here we are talking about what would what would we as people of faith how how might we respond\nTo you know the issues of shootings in school so the shootings the schools is the presenting or just violence in our communities is presenting issue and so and obviously there's no guns in the Bible but there are swords and spears so you've got plenty of plenty of places where we talk about\nHow do we respond to people who are our enemies we've got Jesus saying love your enemies we've got Paul talking about you know doing good to those that would harm you you know you've got a lot of things you could [noise] so so there's a part of that that's going to be about those basic biblical principles but then there's going to be another part that's going to say so are there any solutions and is there any way that we as people of faith\nOn the left in the right can come together to find some solutions and in the end we found that more than two thirds of our people\nWho were gun owners agreed with us or you know we lifted up four or five basic things that people said yes that that makes sense and in the end you know part of what we did as I said you know\nFor those of you know it's easy sometimes in the ... in the world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA are all gun toting nuts\nBut I I have friends and people who I Love dearly who are in the in our and they love to hunt and they're not gun toting nuts and they grieve every time there's a shooting the school on the other side you know you've got these aren't people who want to take all your guns away these are people who want to figure out we've got we've got to do something we got to come together so when you can when you can\nPeople who want to figure out we've got we've got to do something we got to come together and so when you can when you can treat both sides as human beings and you can help them hear each other it opens the door to finding answers\nWhat does your congregation want from its religious experience at our church do they want a place to deal with the social issues\nThat they want to refuge from the politics of the day do they just want you to stick to the scripture but did he want you to be more prophetic on the issues of our times what is your congregation expressing to you know the answer is yes all of a lot of it if I get emails\nAcross the spectrum I have people who are like you know I it just it makes me so mad when you talk about what's you know what's going on the news I don't want to hear about politics when it comes to church and again politics becomes the catch all phrase for something you said that I don't agree with\nAnd uh but I've got other folks are like so immigration on the border when a when the children are being separated from the news broke about that\nYou know I'm hearing this News I'm out of town I'm hearing this news throughout the week I'm studying and and I'm like do I talk about that this Sunday or do I spend another week really trying to see how it's going to resolve because I have a feeling within a week it's going to be it will start to be resolved and sure enough within a week there was an executive order and it's not all resolved but\nAnd I have people who are really mad like why didn't you you should have preached on this this weekend and I had other people were like thank you for not preaching on this weekend and the next week and I did I did that it was Father's Day weekend I did talk about it but um\nSo it's all over the map on that are there but here we we also sort of the congregation we find out we were doing a worship survey to find out about music and different things what they what they want but we asked about the sermons which the sermons or do you find most compelling and then I'm On a response was when Adam deals with current issues where he's dealing with what's going on in the world\nBut for every person says that there's somebody else who's saying I Wish you wouldn't do that and you just stick to talking about love\nWe're speaking to Adam

A. M. U. dot org me get to a few more of your comments Laura is in Goshen, Indiana\nLaura emailed Trump as the vanguard of our worst angels is effectively sounding the horn to release previously restrained prejudices latent in some Americans hate is now fair game and high volume what they call the end of political correctness is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now\nThis is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now you don't know what you've got till it's gone and it's gone\nHeidi by Eric I Wonder if you could respond to that comment I Wonder if what Laura is saying in a way takes a little of the pressure off of President Trump in so far as he didn't create these views he happened to have tapped into them but you can't tap into something that wasn't already there\nWell I think that's a completely fair position I mean you know the United states has had a long problem with white supremacy and racism and legally oppressed you know parts of its own population for centuries\nSo that that it's legitimate to say that this kind of hate has been there\nI Will say that the work we do at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great escalation and the number of hate groups for example\nOn line hate rhetoric particular lean during the years that Obama was in office as an African American he very much a set off white supremacist who were unhappy with him being elected to the highest office\nAnd the Internet itself has allowed this kind of material to proliferate radicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't the case in prior air as so we have a lot more of it around and that's certainly something Trump has tapped into\nNick how do you see it ah there's no question that there is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe ah there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of a post World war two consensus um you know in general throughout through the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America a Trump did not create that he isn't happening it and he's exploiting it to his political ah aims we need\nExploiting it to his political uh aims we need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse and this is not um I'm not even talking about the rhetoric of hate per say I'm a polarization of opposition at this point according to Gallup about twenty six percent of people\nIn America identify as Republican about twenty seven or twenty percent identify as Democrats these are historic lows\nAs those noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other major institutions\nWe need to come up with a a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is\nI'm not a you know that is not based on demonization polarization and again either Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not simply a politician he is also on some level I he should be leading the discussion in a way that has more productive than he is\nBut he's also not the only one are you doing this um\nAnd um the other thing to think about though is what is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and you know when we we live in a ... a society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera\nBut in general crimes are going down and violence is going down so again\nRecognizing that rhetoric is one thing in reality is another I think is you know as the starting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need to reset and that it needs to be a it needs to move away from polarization but this is much much bigger than Donald Trump I Wonder though Nick how much power we give the words that are set especially in the political sphere\nThe words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not seeing that words have zero power but ... who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence those words yeah weapons for sure and they led to a war\nAh you know yeah I I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realized that I you know or maybe it's a slippery position where I'm saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters but also that we need you know what what are we going to do about this I guess as it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous it as hate filled is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's been now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how do how do we have a better conversation about politics about places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then in that policies that actually work for the benefit of of\nI Do want to talk a little bit more going forward a little later in the conversation about what next steps my looked like next so we'll we'll circle back to that Jennifer mochi a number of people\nHave commented on the role of the press of various media outlets and I will try hard not to use the term ... media\nBecause there are so many different kinds of media out there will try to be a specific as we can and and thanks to those of you who've commented who has been specific who've mentioned specific networks or specific people that is extremely helpful so keep that up\nLet me get to a few of your comments about various media outlets in various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs to the twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news\nAnd those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news the president much like Andrew Jackson stands up to the press should he just let the Ninety percent negative coverage go we all need to be personally responsible mod asks why does he get so much airtime\nAnd Jim Wright's why hasn't anyone address the years of conditioning the public has received from talking heads such as Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck Alex Jones et cetera\nThe permeated our society and uh finally elected veer leader which only embolden some Jennifer before you react to that sweet of comments I should note that Glenn Beck in recent years\nHas tried to walk back some of his rhetoric and has as publicly apologized in his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder Jennifer what your sense of how much of a ... various media outlets playing this\nAs a great question and I think that and there's a little bit of a historical big picture that and maybe would inform my answer here I'm In part of that is a reciprocal rule that used to exist between the president and the press\nAnd it used to be the case that uh there was a mutually beneficial relationship between the presidency and the press a largely because they needed each other the press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out\nAnd that relationship has fractured and that's largely due to um cable news and social media and the fact that we all now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nTo disseminate and circulate information including the president\nUm and so information circulates in a very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago um which is really fractured this relationship between the press and the president and Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but Trump has really done much better for worse job depending on your perspective um and so a Trump is completely mastered the news cycle\nAnd the way that uh is especially cable news has been complicit I think in\nIn amplifying his message or you know on Twitter he has followers many of them are bought a but most of Americans aren't on Twitter but we see his tweets everywhere right\nAnd because those messages are amplified and that is Trump using the bully pulpit the good puppet of the presidency and also taking advantage of all of these other social media opportunities\nUm and and so in this case a lot of times the press is been guilty of amplifying those messages when they shouldn't have\nHeidi Baraka wonder how much you put the blame on various media outlets versus the president I feel like at this point we're kind of used to the drum beat of opinionated commentators on television and radio it's almost a trope in our culture I mean\nThe new Spiderman game on the police station has J Jonah dream of some of the guy used to be the publisher of the daily bugle where Peter Parker worked as an AM talk show host whose whole job is to criticize

won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Jennifer ... by Rick and Nick Gillespie few more of your comments Fernando tweeted we are all adults at adults take responsibility for their own actions the media is trying to find a scapegoat and it is truly unfair but then again he is blamed for everything done wrong\nUnfair but then again he is blamed for everything done writes the shooter is responsible dumb question\nDrew tweeted Trump may not be responsible for the violence but the people who are feeling Bolden and encouraged by what he says as long as he remains inconsistent and denouncing violence and hatred they'll continue seeing him\nAs an ally ... could you respond to that last week from drew it is true that the president\nHas denounced the violence I mean the first statement he made after the carnage in Charlottesville was to denounce white supremacy bigotry hatred melts forms\nThen in that press conference that impromptu press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday I think he said there were good people on both sides ... I Wonder\nHow you view this in terms of the the way that the president denounces violence at least in a statement and then makes comments that are vitriolic there after how do you see this\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address the question of responsibility and if we have a moment to that after answer and so Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say [laughter] he will read from the teleprompter when he is forced to do that\nUm but that isn't his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial I'm In these situations when people do try to hold him accountable and suggest that he has some responsibility for something\nSo for example during the campaign I'm a group of white nationalist at the Daily Stormer decided that they would avenge and what they thought was a bad a article that was written by Julie ... um and so they sent\nIt was written by Julian ... um and so they sent her um hate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nUm and when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and you know this is on CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it\nAnd then he denies association with the people right or he says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mine you know are these are these fans who've done this\nUm and then he does a third thing which is to wonder what um the journalist Julie off he had done to deserve this hatred you know did she write this terrible article that is full of you know lives about me um and then to accuse other people doing the same kinds of things right to an appeal to hypocrisy\nUm and if you look at when Trump is responding to these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nUm he follows that same pattern he denies knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to cook week which is an appeal to ... to say oh everybody else does is it's not just me\nUm and that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable [noise]\nThis is why I call him a demagogue a demagogue is an an accountable leader and that's a historic definition deriving from ancient Athens\nUm and and we're talking about whether Trump is responsible and we can say that he's responsible but I'm telling you Trump does not accept responsibility he won't take that responses\nIt's not accept responsibility he won't take that responsibility um and admit that he in fact has been wrong\nI Wonder how effective the Jennifer ... in a situation like this to refer a lot of blaming you for this I'm just kind of wondering what your take is on it to refer to President Trump\nAs a demagogue I mean she is the duly elected president of the United states of America she won the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue\nYou call all the people who are elected him supporters enablers of a demagogue at a time when something like this happens that's got to make it harder to have the kind of debate we need to have about ... about refining the civil discourse\nSure it's an accurate term\nSo um if you look it up in the Oxford English dictionary and the lady you'll see that the first step finishing of a demagogue is positive for neutral it says that it's a leader of the people which is the etymology of the word\nWho defends the rights of the people against the other parts of the state the second definition of demagogue is a leader who uses polarizing propaganda for their own personal gain\nDonald Trump is a demagogue in both senses of the word\nFor his fans for his followers and has voters the ones who won't leave him who will defend him at all costs they defend him because they see him as a heroic demagogue they see him as defending their rights against the other parts of the state that they believe are corrupt\nEveryone else who sees him as a demagogue and the bad sense of the word sees him as using polarizing propaganda for his own game\nThe use of the word is the use of the word accurate though\nBut to the use of the word is the use of that word accurate though it may be is it helpful\nI think so [laughter] it's an analytic point we can't understand what Donald Trump is doing if we can't understand what he's doing an unaccountable leader is a danger in any political community but it's actually in a democracy\nPolitical scientists and historians who are concerned about the health as American democracy people who are charting democratic erosion and how democracies die they point to the kind of language that he uses they point to the authoritarian tendencies of I'm wanting to uh\nYou know Jill people or change the constitution to all of these things all of these authoritarian tendencies and which are are grounded in his language frankly I'm as as evidence of democratic erosion\nHiding I Wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think are a number of people on the political right have raised which is this idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around but the political discourse\nAs heated up in both directions many on the right has pointed to the left saying that they use similar rhetoric to the rhetoric the President Trump has been using but\nThey don't get cold out for quite as much here is a sample of some of what they're referring to\nIs time for us as Democrats [noise] to be as they are dedicated his arms and he was committed to say on the show is is you know when they go low we don't [laughter] they go low we too [laughter]\nThey go low we\nThank\nThat you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to recognize and respect strength\nThat of course was former secretary of state and democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton preceded by democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters and first was former attorney general Eric Holder Heidi what about the portion is across the political spectrum how does that factor into into our current climate\nWell there's no question that there was ... as well on the left\nBut I think it's a little ridiculous to try to say sort of like Donald Trump did after Charlottesville but there's some sort of equivalent here the real nastiness is coming from the right and it's coming on the basis of attacks on immigrants\nMuslims global is which many people would argue are anti Semitic theories and and there's something else more the violence is coming from the right

weren't allowed to use the B word this word is very charged for a lot of men I mean even that song by Frank Sinatra witchcraft where he says there's just no nicer which than you I think that's kind of

career Halloween\nJohn Carpenter directed and scored the original back in Nineteen Seventy eight and he's the composer on the twenty Eighteen sequel which is in theaters now John Carpenter welcome to want to thank you for having me you've been away from the Halloween movie franchise for some time now what made you decide to come back\nOn his producer Hollywood producer Jason Blum a convinced me to come back\nI knew that one was a a a sequel was going to be made as I Know a Malik the cod he's the the son of the man who put up the money for the original Halloween so I knew there was a sequel coming\nBut Jason's bomb a talk to me and he said you know where it's going to be made with or without us so why don't we meaning he he and I\nI'm getting bored and try to help it be good so nobody had put it to me that way before so I thought that's a great great thing\nJason Blum spend doing some pretty interesting things with horror movies lately ... what what do you make of where the genre stance today\nThat's in good shape but it's always in good shape horror has been was cinema since the very beginning and I have a feeling\nA will be with us until doomsday just because everybody's scared of something that they're all born afraid we all understand fear and so it's really fun to go to a horror movie with your girlfriend or your significant other and cuddle and scream and so forth\nCuddle and scream and so forth\nWhat was it like for you not being in the directors chair for the twenty Eighteen version of Halloween you were involved in the film but what about watching someone else direct this movie it was a relief\nBecause I don't have to suffer the stress and anxiety that directors suffer and that's a worst profession in the world other than being a cold I enter\nThe worse other than a cold I'll come on\nNow well it could it could be worse I guess you could be a slaughterhouse type measures that you're right ah it's not the worst now uh when when things were a it's great to be a director when they don't work it's it's really garbage\nWhat do you think movie fans least understand about what it takes to direct a movie especially a horror movie\nWell ever order they at least understand let me think a a\nDirectors are responsible for all the central elements of a movie if it's supposed to be funny they're responsible for the humor of it if it's an adventure and so forth and so on so director of a horror movie think of it this way horror and comedy or a lot like\n'cause it's tiny it's all about timing and\nIt's all about when things happen and how they unfold and it's more complex than than people assume but um people just thinks that horror as a lot of Gore and obvious violence and it's not\nYeah see I I I hear you on that it's an interesting analogy between the horror and comedy I'm not big on Gore I Do not personally do well or on blood and Gore at all but a good suspenseful movie\nLike I can I can hang with that 'cause that's that's a satisfying experience what what do you think it takes to make that kind of timing in a horror movie\nIt takes to make that kind of timing in a horror movie work\nWhat is it what does it take to make a horror movie work these are secrets that only the Brotherhood no so I Can't oh come on you can tell me something well look to make it really simple\nUh there are no rules for any horror film\nThe horror horror movies come out of the story and horror is every\nAction think of it that way not a genre necessarily so it's a reaction to things\nAnd that if the story is is unfolding then you use the story tell it to a a a set up your scares and set up things frightening for the audience he said the word earlier suspense that's what you if you get the audience in suspense and you can scare them\nSo maybe the key is having a story it's got enough of the right elements to make me feel that suspense so that they're there can be that pay off so that there can be the scare is that it\nThat is correct you got it what about the music you contributed music to this film and and the music to the original in Nineteen Seventy eight what does it take to make that kind of music work for a scary movie\nWhat does it take it takes a certain amount of talent and ability to play musical instruments and a feeling for him\nThat's what it takes\nNow were you always musically inclined when you put the original movie Halloween together Nineteen Nineteen Seventy eight or was it something that kind of came together unexpectedly\nKnow as I grew up in a musical household my father was a music professor he was a [noise] a virtuoso violin player and he had taught to college level music courses at a university\nCollege level music courses at a university where I grew up I grew up with music in the house all the time classical music listening to it\nHe decided when I was about eight years old and I should learn to play the violin there was only one problem with that and I had no talent other than that it was a great idea\nBut I moved on from the violin to the piano and guitar and other things I picked a lot of stuff up\nWere there any particular influences that you draw on when you made the music for the original Halloween or that you've drawn on over the years\nYes I'm all classical a\nMovie composers and classical ... ah musicians and rock and roll I'd get influenced everywhere\nWhat about the timing I did the theme to the original Halloween is not in a plain old for for your time it's in five four time it's an odd kind of time's signature was what drew you to that\nMy father taught me five four time uh when I was Thirteen he'd try it on the I had a pair of bongos I got the Christmas we taught me five four on that and I thought it was unusual just straightforwardly unusual timing so\nAdapted that time's signature to the piano piece and there we are\nWe're speaking to John ... the director of dozens of Harvard Classics including probably some of your favorites Halloween to think Christine prince of darkness escape from New York also a musician and composer who wrote the soundtracks for many of his films including the sequel to Halloween which
