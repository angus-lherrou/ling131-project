capitals what are the state level trends tell us about the political direction of the country\nThis time around we'll explore trends in gun legislation and proposals around the nation today also marks one year since the mass shooting in Las Vegas at an open air country music festival it left fifty eight people dead and hundreds of people wounded\nAfter that shooting many people called for more gun control measures particularly on bump stocks some states passed bump stock restrictions other major restrictions went nowhere\nBut this year some things shifted after another mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida a gunman walked into that school and killed seven teams\nIn Florida a gunman walked into that school and killed Seventeen students and staff\nThat sparked a movement led by students survivors in states around the nation started restricting gun access including some states with Republican governors\nJoining us in Studio to discuss it is Scott Greenberg executive editor of state line a journalism project of the Pew Charitable trusts Scott welcome back to one day thanks very much for having me joining us from NPR in New York is Chris Brown

invitation still stands\nScott Greenberg let me start with you this has been a heck of a year for the gun control movement and also the gun rights movement in the U.S give us the broad overview of what's been going on as I understand that\nThere are about fifty new laws restricting got access that move forward including and fourteen states that have Republican governors right\nThat's right and uh we tracked this since the shooting in Parkland, Florida a last February because ah it what we found and this is really interesting was that up until Parkland even with ah the many other mass shootings unfortunately that have taken place a that for them\nI'm mass shootings unfortunately that have taken place\nA that for the most part states reacted by expanding gun rights I'm up until Parkland Parkland seems to have shifted something or perhaps a because the students there um\nBecame so politically active and so outspoken a so quickly or that following that um [noise] incident it seems that ah states have moved from the other direction as you noted are\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the doors do charitable foundation whos clinical scientists development

Joshua Johnson we're discussing trends this year in New state gun laws and proposals part one of our new series the state we're in we're speaking to Scott Greenberg or executive editor of state line of course brown the co president of the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence and Richard Feldman president of the independent firearm owners association\nRichard by the way before we keep going we mentioned that you are a former lobbyist for the get already you're not president of a group called the independent firearm owners association\nFor those who may not have heard of it that's that's a separate organization from\nFor those who may not have heard of it that's that's a separate organization from NRA right or is it affiliated or is there any relationship no just clarify\nNo relationship between the two I headed up the firearm industry's trade association during the Nineteen nineties\nGotcha okay thank you I just wanted to make sure we're kind of clear on on the the distinction between your organization and the and the n._r._a. Scott Greenberger I Wonder if we can talk a little bit more about red flag laws and their impact the Jerry Brown the governor of California the outgoing four term governor of California\nJust vetoed a bill that would have expanded that states red flag law Jerry Brown is a Democrat very progressive but also thoroughly pragmatic and has pushed back on Democrats get an array of ways so\nThis is an unprecedented in terms of him vetoing something the Democrats would have wanted but what do you make of the veto\nWell a ... you know California of course is a very blue state of progressive state and already had um a\nA relatively speaking a pretty strong gun control laws in place so I'm Jerry Brown has a governed as a a pragmatic a liberal and progressive and so um [noise]\nUh you know in this case he felt like it at perhaps you know with some of the concerns that ah Richard raise that uh it went a little too too far um and a return note it's a question of of balance but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking a that a lot of the debate um\nPost a Parkland has focused on\nA these so called red flag laws or I'm\nA limiting the gun\nRed flag laws or I'm a limiting the gun access to guns for people a domestic abusers you know the argument or the n._r._a. is argument for for such a long time was that a\nGuns don't kill people people kill people and it seems that now rather than trying to revive a for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties\nOr people who are in favor of more um\nUh safeguards gun control are pushing on red flag laws are they're pushing on background checks and it seems like that's a potential uh common ground between people who are\nA very strongly support their Second Amendment or what they view as their Second Amendment gun rights and and folks who would like a um some more ah controls and safeguards speaking\nOf the ... are a governor Larry Hogan of Maryland who's a Republican had an a minus rating from the national Rifle Association here he is endorsing a red flag law in February\nI've said for years um that we need to do more\nTo keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill\nAnd people with criminal backgrounds that's why we will push for and support what is known as red flag legislation\nIn general this policy would allow family members for law enforcement to petition the court for a lethal violence protective order issued by judge which were prohibited individual from having any firearms or ammunition\nIf the judge has clear evidence that the family member poses a an immediate and present danger um ah causing injury to themselves or to others\nCausing injury to themselves or to others [noise] individuals with a mental illness should not have access to the fire on there\nThat is Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland worth noting that who's a minus rating from the un already dropped to ... feet as a result of his support of these kinds of red flag laws Chris I Wonder what impact do you think\nThat that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nI think it has a positive impact absolutely a and I think governor Hogan actually there is a he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician he has to be aware that that has an impact\nOn his NRA rating it has an impact on the rating that Brady Gibson as well and I think it relates back to the initial point\nThat I made that is part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new\nSlate of polls that have been taken\nWhich show in every state across this country a vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies or supporting exactly these kinds of measures\nThey're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures and they balance appropriately uh the you know the second Amendment rights of of gun owners with uh the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking components of my job\nIs getting polling data back and focus group information that really yields two different things and I\nThis group information that really yields two different things and I think it's really important to think about these laws in this context first\nAmericans overall when they ask about their fear associated with being shot one of the most profound quotes I got back from a recent poll is well most people think I have not been shot yet\nAnd and that is a very concerning thing the second is many Americans are actually ashamed\nAbout the epidemic of gun violence in this country and they want pragmatic solutions say certainly applaud governor Hogan for doing the right thing here but I think he like many politicians are looking at what their constituents want\nAnd moving forward knowing that these are popular and populist positions to take\nA here you Chris in terms of the pragmatic argument but you know when it comes to gun laws their constituents in their constituents I mean Vermont is a good example of that I mean ... was one of the states to ban bump stocks as part of a larger package of legislation on guns this year back in April Vermont governor Phil Scott who's a Republican who had an a rating from the n._r._a.\nSigned these laws in these bills into law\nGo to Scott said he changed his mind about them after police\nFoiled an alleged shooter's plans to form a local high school and basically kill as many people as possible now here is some of the sound from the signing ceremony as he was signing outside the Vermont state house she was being heckled by opponents to gun restrictions was I aren't\n[noise]\nAre\nReally doing everything we can to make our kids in our community safe [noise]\n\nWhere our kids are afraid to go to school and parents are afraid to put them on a bus\nOr police don't have the tools they need to protect victims of violence or families can step in to prevent a loved one\nThe signing ceremony on the steps of the Vermont state house with Vermont governor Phil Scott who is a Republican Richard Feldman Philbin when you hear that moment from the signing ceremony ... what does that tell you about that the nature of this debate in states across the country\nI think in many ways the pro gun community led by the national Rifle Association is somehow corner did self by its own success I'm a politics of this issue transcends the policy of this issue\nAnd therein lies so much of the problem in getting this debate focused in a way\nThat we can achieve\nResults that work for everyone and we can but not when we focus on the politics but only on the policy we really have to align those two and dealing with the perceptions versus the realities in this society it's highly unlikely that anyone\nYou or I Know directly is going to be\nAnyone you or I Know directly is going to be shot\nIt's a statistical thing but of course it's gonna make news and we're all I'm In the same boat when when we see things day in and day out we feel like it's all around us we deal as human beings with these perceptions um\nSupport for NPR comes from

series the state we're in continues here on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Richard Feldman Chris Brown and Scott Greenberg or a few more different kinds of laws that we should touch on before our time is up we should talk about the minimum age is to purchasing long guns and rifles four states California Hawaii Illinois\nFlorida passed new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State representative who ... who was a Republican sponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a.\nSerious speaking on WBFO our TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of his interview\nA determining what age someone can do something as a judgment call and we do it in in many areas of our of our law making and so I think it was for that on was the fact that you have an Eighteen year old a who did purchased this weapon I think I think without that partake in fact he probably wouldn't have seen that\nWhat about law abiding Floridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom have gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas what are you say to those who feel like their Second Amendment rights are being infringed\nWell particularly that group of people that you mentioned are covered in the law so if you have if you're a correctional officer if you're a parole officer if you're a law enforcement officer or or you served in the military society has already said that you're trained and can carry a firearm so this bill would not impair that even at those ages that state rep hosts\nSo this bill would not in favor of the even if those are just that's the ... in Florida Republicans the rub speaking to us for TV in Miami Chris I Wonder how you think you will play out with this law particularly because an array of challenging it in court\nStand are as challenging it in court I think I'm Marion Hammer who's been a very effective lobbyists there for the\nNRA for a long time um had a suit filed within twenty four hours of the measure passing\nI think that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our review 'em and be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to the a mass shooting involving you know that often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe of Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will note that Florida passed a package of laws or the minimum age being one all of which were\nA really designed to address the the type of issues that we saw\nA from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in the home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of package bills a reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me is it passed in the state of Florida\nRat has long been one of the strongest a sort of ... of the enterprise legislative agenda and I think is very telling on obviously the reactions of Parkland and the the activism that took place immediately\nAnd that that activism that took place and media lay following a the Parkland shooting\nI Would like to come back to save storage in a moment but in ... by the way we did a program when we visited Salt Lake city about guns in the mountain west states and and the nature of gun suicide in the mountain west in which a state representative who joined us showed us one of these safe storage lockers that does open with your fingerprints I tried it it it works it's it's pretty fascinating\nYou can find that conversation online at our website the one a dot org before we move on to other kinds of gun legislation Richard Feldman could I just get your sense in terms of\nThe n._r._a. is real view on gun legislation ... has said that some measures like bump stock restrictions could be examined maybe through the administration's authority on a federal level rather than the state level\nOr we just kidding ourselves here should we just come out and just say the n._r._a. is not in favor of any new gun legislation that can be passed on a bipartisan basis are we trying to make the n._r._a. more ten fifth wheel and more collaborative than it really is\nWell first one to find something I'm always a little bit of a loss to understand when people talk about the n._r._a.\nOn an endowment number the n._r._a. there five million NRA members um there's the board of directors is the senior leadership there that can psalms there are many and raise\nThere's my uncle was a card carrying life member of the IRA and we'll show you his card on demand if you ask with great pride\nHas so many will myself included um but I I\nWe'll myself included um but I I I think we're talking about the senior leadership\nOf NRA here and um again when I said earlier an array finds itself institutionally boxed in a corner of if you're calling it gun control no matter what it is it could mandate that are when you turn Twenty one you're given a gun\nThey're almost institutionally has to be against it because of the terminology in the political position of the terms gun control\nThey don't mean what we sometimes think they mean are they mean different things to different people at different times\nBut you know what I mean I'm Talking about Wayne LaPierre Oliver North of the leadership of the national Rifle Association what we hear you know from the big feet Dana lash the main figures who speak with a national voice for the n._r._a. it's the\nYou know the only thing that stops a bad guy with the gun is a good guy with a gun it's those ads within the last that say you know they are coming for our freedom and they use their media and the n._r._a. as you know ... you know liberties last safe place that NRA that's who I'm Talking about\nWhat you're talking about that's politics\nThat's galvanizing the true believers that's about membership that's about fundraising that's about a organizing for the next a political event both sides to it and there's nothing unusual about that whether we're talking firearms or the environment\nOr any other hot button issues and America\nEverybody does it that way perhaps we see it a little more [noise]\nEverybody does it that way perhaps we see it a little more distinctly in the firearm debate than others when we've been put on that side Scott well I just wanted sides I wanted to ah just ah to to add to that that you've\nSeen on some of those issues issues you just mentioned and perhaps uh we're going to begin to see it on gun control as well that in cases where state legislatures are gridlocked and the power of a [noise] um the gun lobby is such that uh that lawmakers won't pass anything [noise] um\n[noise] uh there is another outlet in many states and that's about an issue of Washington state will have a ballot initiative a November that would raise the minimum age to buy a a\nSemi automatic rifle to Twenty one uh Oregon people in Oregon in support of a similar measure came close to getting down on the ballot so we may see that I mean that's that was a pattern with the marijuana legalization for example so that that might be a that might be coming in the future\nLet me get to a few more of your calls and comments we did get a call about speed gun legislation in Missouri from

testimony we have received\nJust an avalanche of voice mails and text and emails for many of you sharing your stories with us we'll get to some of them today we wish we could share more but we're so grateful for all the ones we do have time to include so thank you for telling us your stories one listener key key under her email to us with the appeal don't ignore us\nCertainly not we will not be ignoring you at all this hour or an anytime and we walk more of your stories and questions as well about dealing with these stories comments on our Facebook page tweet us ... when a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org we're speaking to Lawrence Taylor the founder and director of defend yourself\nAnd Harvard professor terrorists and Conan who studies sexual assault trauma before we bring in our next guest let me get to some of your stories and comments one member of the one eight tax club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and afraid of a dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing\nIt's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it\nThe thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping by the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you're more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids out of time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words are the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board Mara welcome to the program\nThanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times an account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote I never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nAn unremarkable what made you think of what you had been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years and my friends and I have been and colleagues as well just sharing\nStories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of ours sexual assaults of our sexual harassment and just knowing how many of my friends\nTo harassment and just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist who I I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues during Dr Ford's testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain and they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink\nMy decision to just stay silent on my own experience\nCan you sure we'll just what a recent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think um we both had um an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place um and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to\n'em and it was very painful and I I'm often to stop and eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think ... frankly was probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I thought at the time\nFrankly it was probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I thought at the time and you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nNo last week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor Ford said\nIndelible in the hippocampus is the laughter ... the uproar is laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun at my expense\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective why is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the HIPAA campuses and what adults\n[noise] um the hippocampus has a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDoctor forward in her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her and the human brain has specific parts that are involved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm I'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us\nThink about it I'm I'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that fit that fear that lion and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on the brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really\nMakes my heart clutch you know it's really emotional\nBut forget other details like uh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is a brain operate\nThey've kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way he described it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie or you know you walking through on that house you forget all the decor but that being that leaked out at you the kind of forced your adrenalin to rise that wouldn't codes that great example yes\nNo more you said that a moment we'll see mia Lauren Lauren Taylor these moments than coach so intensely\nAre there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or do you just kind of have to deal with those things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through those or ten you\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm Talking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or a ... community support group or an ... uh\nA therapist or a sub communities work group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um what we do in our empowerment self defense classes\nAre is help people\nFind their voice and find their physical power\nA talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but um as professor Conan will tell you\nThe trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of so magic\nUm release of that and some addict basically means so much is body so um we we do role plays of practicing standing up for yourself or asking for what you want and we also do hitting\nAnd um that can be that can really move the trauma through an out your body or not only reclaiming your power but you're also releasing whatever you've been through\nLet me get through a few more of your stories Jennifer emailed my story involves a sexual predator who happened to be my boss ultimately I was raped on a business trip to get away I had to move to another state and begin my career again the cascade of consequences for each woman like me goes on for decades\nShe emailed I'm Seventy two I told my best friend about her employees who sexually harassed me he asked me to show him my breasts while he stroked himself asked disgusting questions you did\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth

New York times journalist Marvin Gaye and Harvard University's terrorists and Conan we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into us\nMy name is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year\nThat I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from I keep hearing people say well why on earth which she wait thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and\nDealing with the fallout from I keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years it has really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why it doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rate that left obvious mar it's easy to pretend it never happened and\nEmotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and so hurt and so is shame\nLoops thanks very much for sharing your story with his mortgage love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment the comes\nAfter that incident like that after an attack like that wow and it's powerful um\nYou know so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault or it was one of the things of many that that I dealt with but I have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nAnd you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown and social research or any shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame need secrecy to survive\nOn and huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I you know I don't believe anymore at that the shame that I've been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story you know I've\nMy own shame and so in telling my story you know I I was I feel a huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe it belongs 'em and no longer hold onto that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around\nAnd that ah I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experiences as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching\nYou know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of the the embodiment of that injustice and\nThat's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from\nI just wanted to um\nThat speak to what this what lives shared about her experience there are very\nHonorable powerful reasons not to tell\nI Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who makes the choice not to tell 'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get ...\nReasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job um but they are all very real\nAt at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nOn top of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell people what happened I was called a whore lucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others\nAnd I was called a complainer\nAnd people wonder why survivors don't come forward\nPat emails when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist began molesting me he was thirty one he told my mom he had some work I could do for him if you check patients in nursing homes he took me some pornographic movie theaters he taught me what a glory hole was\nHe had a friend of his implant an IUD in me this went on for almost two years\nMore and let me stick with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway who spoke this weekend about her own experiences with being assaulted listen\nI feel very empathetic frankly\nExperiences with being assaulted listen\nI feel very empathetic frankly for victims of sexual assault sexual harassment\nAnd rate that [noise]\nI ... I don't expect and judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake or any body to me how responsible for that responsible for your own conduct\nThat was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN learn what do you make it become\nWell first of all I'm Glad she came out as a survivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice ... it's a side of Kellyanne Conway we none of us have ever seen before um\n\nBut she seems to put the blame entirely on herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that\nThe\nAggressor is the only person responsible for the harassment abuse or assault you can for where anything you want you can get is drunk 'cause you want if there is not a rapist there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's\nCarrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry\nCarlos wrote on our Facebook page I Am a fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault by a man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day it is difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of this I rarely hug any one and I'm ... extremely protective of my daughters\nProfessor Conan would you react to that I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how\nThis might be playing out differently for male survivors of trauma versus women who have been traumatized\nThank you for bringing this up because um [noise] one of the things we haven't\nThank you for bringing this up because I'm\nOne of the things we haven't talked much about is that men are also victims of sexual abuse and assault um and that the effects on them I'm of developing anxiety phobia pie TST are similar to that that women experience after being assaulted\nAnd I think for men who are victims of sexual assault if it's possible there's more stigma there is even more stigma in terms of being able to come out\nUm and um be heard um so I so in terms of how this is playing out I Wonder how men are feeling in term of do they feel and they identify with Dr Ford would they feel like their experiences are being\nEight to ten o'clock\nThey say there are no dumb questions Neil DeGrasse Tyson says that's true and he's answering your questions about first space and more [noise]\nFrom W.

H. M. U. dot org let me start\nWith the book this alliance between astrophysics and military give us a sense of what that is\nIn a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggests so unspoken\nYeah so so we already are familiar with the role that other sciences I've played in warfare especially engineering you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that first showed up on the battlefield one uh\nWhen that was first showed up on the battlefield one at a symmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where your opponent has something that you don't have and you were in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call it an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the new book of of Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a master mind that sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of its scientist engineer and an artist\nBut moving forward you think of the physicist as a person who builds the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know the can is you know would make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas at the biologist might weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association\nBecause we just humbly said mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy\nAnd then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics and the military and just never shows up but in fact astrophysicist and then the earlier days astronomers have been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations\nUm in particular the the need to navigate with precision\nAround the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nMy my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nAnd to to know the night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky what's different depending on where you are on earth and things rise at different times inside out in different places\nAnd so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control over it\nI should know we didn't have a conversation on this program for those who are more interested in this connection between science and the military\nAbout the origins of chemical weapons during World War one and a good bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which produces one egg you can find that conversation on line at the one eight dot org\nNew President Trump announced the creation of a space forced this summer a six the branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space I guess it will be a fifth ... since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of ... within there is a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have accomplish avoid to be in the best interest of the American people and of humanity\nSo first of all just to to the space forces not a new concept and ah it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission nicer\nRemembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the u._s. aerospace industry which at the time\nWas had fallen they've fallen on hard times they lost a half a million jobs there was consolidation in the industry it was competition from Europe with Airbus and other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets\nSo there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry\nTo what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon it's on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're\nRight or at least to the nearest airport [laughter] ... doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but\nWe would call them drones I guess but so so you you ... when you look at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well\nMight we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns or space because these are the same companies\nAerospace companies that that became a word right and if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general\nAnd the air force then and now controls space activities of the military it's called the U.S air force base command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space where it's separate from what's already happening so I wasn't going to second guess the general but\nFrom what is already happening so I was I get a second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had fast forward to today on the Trump announcement as well as the Pence follow on announcement\nA bit if you just listen to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nThat was very we don't want to just be there we went to we don't wanna just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will this mean\nDo you think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy had Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than say the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really represent rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force and slide them out under one umbrella once with a coherent umbrella\nAnd if you're going to do that uh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it\nThat could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroid strikes and then the limit it could rent or is ... thanked as one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all\nSpecies of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only\nSpecies of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that it's a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nAnd the long term survivor ability right of of of the ... that requires the sunlight to feed it so so space force\nWould might include ... by the way I Would also throw in on your clean up the debris it's up there while you're yes the space debris problem but so so here's the distinction I Want to make which ... which I don't I haven't seen the press or the public recognize\nSpace is very hard and not particularly strategic\nTo make space and at the repository of weaponry\nHolding aside the fact that that would violate a treaty to which we are signature and today more than a hundred countries are son\nFrom Nineteen sixty seven that it's a peaceful use of outer space treaty has a much longer name that I always forget right those are those are the that those are the essence words from the title and it's very beautiful treat it you feel like holding hands and sing in ... as you read it particularly at a time when there's the Cold War but space activities weren't right on the rise\nFor the love of jazz present see Alex hand ban for

MacArthur Foundation and Mac found dot org\nMore with Neil DeGrasse Tyson in just a moment but first a question particularly for women in this political moment how angry are you right now tomorrow's conversation deals with a long history of anger expressed by women in America and what it's meant for the country\nWhat's your story have there been times when you chose not to get mad or maybe you grew up being told never to lose your cool\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a now if you have like rip or if you feel more empowered to let folks know exactly how you feel what differences that made tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a\nCan also use or app won a vox pop to send us a radio quality audio file we'll talk about women and this and other moments of anger tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Neil DeGrasse Tyson lots of good questions to get through let's see how many of these we can get through in the time that we have left Eli wrote on our Facebook page that she's a big fan of yours Eli writes\nI have a job interview at Goddard today the God of space flight center do you have any suggestions on how I can slam dunk this thing it's my dream to be able to work at NASA\n[laughter] [noise] I think in this kind of in the world of of exploring the frontier or not only\n[noise] uh exploring the frontier or not only a strong resume matters but uh inter personally enthusiasm ... I think really matters they want to know that you you really care and you're ... you're in it and you're\nYou're you have spirit energy that is spilling out of you that all that your whole body mind and soul is ready to be given onto this grand adventure\nThat we're all part taking in in the exploration of space so I think if you convey that uh I don't know if it's a slam dunk but at least it's a um\nIt's a shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay in basketball analogy\nJay tweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain into a machine chassis I eat a robot body are transplanting a human consciousness into a computer\nSo first the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions as also we do some very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing to put a human brain into a robotic chassis\nUm when you could program the robotic chassis to have almost anything you really care about I don't see that as as as a thing that people will do and the other option was what to put that to to put our consciousness I tell you I think that'll happen either\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is an evidence of that is how many books are still written on it that evidence that usually you don't know what it is for example if you look on the shelf of books on gravity is like three books we got gravity [laughter] we're not still writing books on its alone it just for the law\nWe're not still writing books on it ... it just for the law obey gravity so um but it is sort of uploading all of your electro chemical impulse is into some machine to mimic that\nTo mirror that maybe that comes along with consciousness we don't know but I see that happening long before we would take a brain and stick it in a in a machine by the way speaking of translating brain would I really want\nIs if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure a O. S.\nAt least find a way to transplant the brain of an Alzheimer's patient into the body of I'm\nI'm not sorry the brain of an ale less patient into the body of an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body the other you lose your your mind\nIs that this sounds very altered carbon even lost a lot of mental exam is very Frankenstein to it really was I just said if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find cures for both of those before we learn how to transplant of brain but I think about that all the time certainly helps them certainly helps out on wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is that there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and your scoop out some water and they analyze the water really carefully inside\nThere no whales in the ocean looking [laughter]\nNow you haven't looked so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy and our search for life are intelligent life uh for example uh um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or Mars and perhaps other places\nBut all in our backyard or or Mars and perhaps other places but anyone who study the problem is in no way doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\nAmy asked on our Facebook page will the human race cease to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends not considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\n[noise] we're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because the more dangerous an asteroid is the bigger it is typically and the bigger it as the easier it is to detect\nSo so ah I I think we're good about that it's possible that a comet could come\nFrom out of nowhere because comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out\nOr it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but in I regardless you want to help the space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding you know protecting having insurance plan that you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating thing that it would be very rare\nSo but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power\nAnd over nature and heed the warnings are scientists\nI Wonder how what what the over under is on that I tend to be fairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp of the value of the earth that this is the one\nSome of the value of the earth that this is the one home we have than many of their parents and and forebears and I kind of skill today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces but what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful realistically hopeful so but I'm I'm ... I'm\nI'm cynically hopeful so here's how this works cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they act\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right would ever get to that point this so this ... you know because we reach it or or or soil in green no because you reach a point where people say no this is to this is this I cannot tolerate any further on ... ... people\nI don't want to eat people are so rich that bridge is too hot [laughter] right right do you so you so we have restoring forces in the world\nThat prevent swing too low in in this regard and these this topic story telling 'em it involves a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I've ... I've seen people bounce back societies bounce back ... people in power bounce back\nSo how long you're going to deny science until it really interferes with your health and your wealth and he said oh my gosh I think I like science again and then you put the funds back in and so that's why I think we'll be okay\nJared submitted questions through our app won a vox pop do you think that human beings are physically incapable of understanding the fundamental nature\nUnderstanding the fundamental nature of the universe if not what's the timeline to solving say something like\nMatter the question Jared Neil ... so I think about that all the time I lose sleep on whether I was slightly rephrase that question I lose sleep over whether the human mind is smart enough\nTo actually understand the universe as it is\nAnd I worry that we may not be smart enough to even know what question to ask and this disturbs me because we know who defines humans as intelligent we do we do yeah who's to say that that is sufficient intelligence to figure out how the universe works\nSo so uh now dark matter dark energy the advantage to being modern human is that we can we can stand on the shoulders of those who came before us you don't have to invent calculus to solve the next problem somebody else did\nSo in a way we're assembling wrong by wrong a ladder of knowledge that looks over every next wall that we have confronted\nAnd so we were so maybe the sum of all the intelligence of all humans", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "02"}
