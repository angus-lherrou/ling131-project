I Wonder if we can just work your way around first of all and just checking I'm just curious to see how everyone is doing right now in the early me start with you you grew up in the area where this took place\nRight yes I was born and raised in Pittsburgh and specifically and scroll hill and I grew up a few blocks away from the synagogue tree of life and attended many ... and ... says there and even weddings\nAnd uh it is incredibly painful to see this happen anywhere in America but especially in a place that um I call home\nAnd especially considering that another few blocks from the synagogue was Mr Rogers home I literally grew up in Mr Roger's neighborhood was even on his show when I was little\nAnd we got that tape Sunday or what but um it you know this is a community that although it is predominantly Jewish or culturally Jewish is incredibly welcoming tolerant\nDiverse you know really welcomes all comers and it's it is a place where\nUm you know one of the some of the

inclusive welcoming and loving community\nAnd the idea of this happening there at a place where the doors are always open at every synagogue church you know by the way um Pittsburgh was the first place that had a major Hindu temple in America\nUm Pittsburgh was the first place that had a major Hindu temple in America\nI'm also you know mosques every religion you can think of it's just so incredibly painful and my friends I'm from childhood have all been checking in in this community so small that everybody knew somebody who was affected by this rubber drew groups how are you today how are you holding\nUp this is obviously been a very very difficult few days for my community for the Jewish community wearing an organization of more than two thousand rabbis across the U.S and Canada

there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop me\nCharlie ... let's get back to Thomas comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it is given legitimacy\nAnd leads to action one of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident ... what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert Bowers had\nThere so uh ... dot com\nIs a sort of a basically a Twitter cologne um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racists bigots [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter ah for for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know eat the absolute power of of free speech but what ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only these sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I became it it has become a\nHateful because they were angry I became it it has become a a place where white nationalism a and an extreme\nBigotry homophobia whatever a has a has been embraced and and\nUh and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say his name was maybe not radicalize necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his a truly hateful views it was the last place where he\nPosted before the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a\nA a an unproductive vent for a lot of that hatred I'm an after\nAfter um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active a participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming in ... for the first time\nA note noticed that uh that at this place is a dark\nPlace to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying our words are not bullets in social media posts a have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action and I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets anyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWell you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of a free speech communities on line that they don't really believe necessarily in free speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences and then there's sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why\nThis you know this odd warped understanding of why protected so hard if it means nothing um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people\nDon't quite grapple with especially on the Internet rub I ... I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like ... job is not the only place where this kind of speech to lift weights on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named up to be First Amendment the quick First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome to folks\nLike you short well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true I've seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to ... such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want\nThey want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise] I also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae B. T. Q. people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported nimble than from the very top from the president of the United states that the white nationalists see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power and the United states which of course ...\nPulling the levers of power in the United states ... taps into very old anti Semitic ...\nYeah I I I'm Sorry where am I but I Do want to get a little deeper into that\nA lot of Fox a lot of our listeners have been chime in on that and in there I'd love to to get your thoughts at that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism\nAnd every other form of evil and unfortunately evil comes in many forms and we come together as one American Pie for\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning he wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nMust stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must end unquote\nGotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role in all of this Susan is in Silver Spring Maryland right outside D.C Susan writes I look forward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always ...\nForward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always considers but his or her statements have far reaching consequences Indira well\nThis was of course incredibly disturbing to have the president once again demonizing the press\nAnd calling us enemies of the people um that it'll be on the true enemy that people I mean this is this absolutely journalists are essentially in a way the life blood of a democracy if we're not able to inform and educate citizens um about what's going on in their

to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to scream very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nWell thanks for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who is both religious the Jewish and also very much scientific\nI think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower except in on the left of people who have\nA strong religious views and a close connection that Israel I mean uh I teach at a a small just ... here in the city and or in the in the suburbs and a lot of us do feeling of ... out and build at a\nYou know they express a strong and parents that Israel or especially religious views that aren't um\nA strong here instead of Israel or expose religious views that aren't um\nYou know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up in and how you or how the school deals with it\nWell I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we\nMean there are students who are you know are not particularly\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave this school\nAnd they often find their campuses unfriendly that find professors especially a friendly if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh\nSo I mean while it's true I mean I don't think it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence in the left and that that's true I think you are seeing and I think our students feel a certain intolerance\n'em when they go to college um and it's\nYou know I don't know we we tell we do tell kids probably should need need to shut up you know\nAnd I don't say shut up that you know you can't argue with every just kind of who you're going to have to learn to live with that kind of pick your battles I think that's a hard\nThing you have to pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised didn't do that and not\nNot Fadel everything will David I'm going to be it can be very hard\nDavid let me put that to thank you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of Davis comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond to you and to Stephanie or speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say Seventy first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course that high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you know I let it be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism in Alaska and very often it expresses itself\nOften it expresses itself\nAs as attacks on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which it's not you can criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses the line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of Israel's governmental policy is we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nWho carry a violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually Jews who are shopping in a grocery store in a jewelry store in a synagogue\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is it it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore who's ... who's criticizing\nIt was criticizing any kind of hatred and who is trying to restart civil discourse to the U. S. then said we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nAnd we get to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation will get as many recalls as we can as well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our ancient rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strings and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship help to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better Indira would you react to that I feel like part of what\nWorked [laughter] I hate to say in Pittsburgh favor but one of the things I think helped in this whole process as you described grow ill is it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had someone crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to lock arms with one another\nRight I mean a squirrel hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community um it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon University in ... and a lot of the people who live and squeal hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers account\nAre um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentist it's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall\nIs also um you know politically a liberal community and it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton in this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community of Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help and Pittsburgh's favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the and then the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning\nI'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta just four months ago and attack or killed five reporters and Annapolis newsroom the capital Gazette\nSo you know I I Do think we have to worry about drawing the line um I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happened\n... and beyond description CNN is reporting that a suspicious package that was addressed the CNN was intercepted at a post office in Atlanta let's get to a few more of your calls and comments including one from Pittsburgh where Lee is on the line highly what's on your mind\nOr ...\nSure would what's on your mind how ... how are your neighbors do an after all this\nEighty eight point seven in Ninety One point seven KU and every now and Ninety One point five K. and see the okay doing online and K.

Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is reporter Brian grim it Brian got glad to have you with us I happen to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H um public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas\nWith regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth ... in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase or over the last midterm elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges has eventually and just because the turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during the presidential election so we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTwenty fourteen we had six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in the state\nMichael do you want and what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nIt's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them and I'm more expected this morning a we have ... votes\nThousand of them and I'm more expected this morning a we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day and on election day and um uh it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots and\nAnd Brian agreement what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's many of the counties across the state of reporting a\nRecord or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they are Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know a ... they're saying requests in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county by near Kansas City uh they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nBrian let me stick with you how does early voting worked in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through out of Kansas handle voting early\nWell it depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um\nObviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the ... vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request that you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas uh we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make\nThey've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it I'm somewhat accessible to to to voters would like to take that option we heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research candidate amendment or proposition at leisure while completing the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado house has early voting work\nWell basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you you got to do a lot of research in Colorado this year it is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here in Colorado and\nFill out that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or\nOr some other kind of relaxing recreational or some kind of a cup of tea my whatever you want to Broadway\nExactly um you know and so uh you know a lot of people I'm like this system in Colorado but not everyone um you know ... ... ... ... the world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um and now you got to think about um delivering it by hand or just going in on election day and voting\nI'm Glad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off by\nIn mind that there is a certain cut off by which your ballot has to be received November six times and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nBut every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the day that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that is something I Want to remind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day not a postal carriers hands on election day glad to get some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early\nMitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my vote to be cast exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take backs\nRachel is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry about long lines or work or travel on election day that would prevent my voice being hurt\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day ... do you have to lie to vote early in Michigan\nFor all practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to ah basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say I'm going to be out of town\nAnd and why are they are also some other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be over sixty years old or another is may be due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment for trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do\nKyle but no it is well known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot ...\nWhat is being over sixty has to do with voting early\nOr possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's gonna be cold and maybe the idea is that if you don't you don't want to Seventy eight year old having to sit outside let's say in a wheelchair for three four\nHours and ... so that is one a one way that that you can get an absentee ballot\nWe're speaking to silly Clark program director at Michigan Radio based in Ann Arbor Michael ... an investigative reporter was K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado and Brian ... who covers energy and the environment for Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas\nRicky tweeted I early voted because I have an hour commute and a twelve hour a day on Tuesdays I liked being able to look up all of the issues and candidates I was more informed and took more time with my ballot voting from home\nAmen to that ... I have done the exact same thing especially living in California where our voter guide was about as big as I think one if not two of the hobbit novels like stacked on top of one of the it was a ridiculously fit guide and it just took a little time to go through so I hear you on that\nShow dashed ticks dashboard dashing you dashing dot dot com dot the\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from visiting angels professional caregivers assisting adults at home in bathing dressing meals and light housework nationwide visiting angels America's Choice and senior home care learn more at one eight hundred three six five four one eight nine\nAnd from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their home quote explorer tool custom quotes and rates are available online learned more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nWe get back to our conversation we would love your help\nBefore we get back to our conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program about political rhetoric it's a simple question\nIs President Trump responsible for the recent acts of political violence in our country a simple question but not an easy one how much responsibility does he bear all week confusing rally rhetoric with criminal behavior\nWho else is responsible and how much blame did they bear\nWill debate this tomorrow but we'd love to hear your thoughts ahead of that so leave us a voice mail eight five five\nTo three six one a one day how much responsibility if any does President Trump bear for the recent acts of political violence in our country\nEight five five to three six one a one a or you can use our app won a vox pop to send us a radio quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics will share some of your thoughts tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Zoe Clark of Michigan Radio Michael do you wanna of K.

I mean you W public radio in Wichita, Kansas today we're introducing won a across America will be spending the next two years traveling to communities across the country that don't tend to play an outsized role\nIn national elections before them come come back to ... let me get to a few more of your comments Linda tweeted I voted in Hamilton County Ohio over a week ago no lines it was fast and easy\nCounty is in Illinois and county wrote on our Facebook page I'm choosing to vote on election day because I bring my children and want them to see and fees\nBecause I bring my children and want them to see and feel the importance of this right and Melissa tweeted I Love to vote in person I enjoy seeing all of the people getting out to the polls and making their voices heard\nThere's only I Love you to react to a message that one of our listeners since we're app when vox pop from Michigan and told us three reasons that he's voting this year and all of his reasons for voting half do you do with voting\nI show up for Michigan where all three branches of government or a Republican controlled and have been for a number of years\nThe main driver of my voting this year or two constitutional amendments\nThat try to rectify the Republican attempt to suppress or control election participation one proposal links to put redistricting in the hands of a nonpartisan commission the other makes registering to vote easier\nMakes apps and team voting available to all\nAnd finally to prove it straight ticket voting those are pretty important to our democracy and that's why I'm food\nTruck thanks for calling for leaving his voice mail rather than through the ... what would you say the trucks call is that the kind of reflected in why a number of Michigan are voting this year well\nLet's say yes that I mean there he is speaking about proposal to which is a redistricting is he at ... and then proposal three which is being called promote the vote and and that would allow no excuse absentee voting earlier of course we're talking about whether you have to lie or not to to get an absentee ballot that would change how that works um\nYes ah particularly a profit to which would create this independent commission has just sort of taken the state has been at a bar in storm of up a ballad uh\nState has been a a barn storm of a\nA ballot I Am most ballot initiatives like one would like to think right that it's some people some community folks who are like we want to change the law in Michigan let's gather together and let's go you know get enough signatures and put it on the ballot no no no that is not usually how it works in this state usually a\nOrganization some kind of a political organization pays\nFor signature sometimes a dollar two dollars per se that tried to get questions on the ballot but um this voters not politicians as prop to\nChanging redistricting a young woman Katie Faye he twenty eight years old when she started this all grass roots organization got four hundred fifty thousand signatures\nAgain grass roots volunteers to get this question of redistricting on the ballot and this is just sort of fascinated both voters and political watchers in general\nWe've heard from a number of you who are reacting to some of these initiatives in Michigan pat emailed in Michigan seniors over sixty are allowed absentee ballots I Love not having to stand in line at the polls\nThis year a referendum called promote the vote is on the ballot which would allow anyone to use an absentee ballot too many people having trouble getting to the polls on election day\nAnd John emailed I live in Ann Arbor Michigan I voted with an absentee ballot for the first time this year I Do so because I'm volunteering as an election inspector this year\nI'm also working with the voters not politicians group and supportive prompt too which is passed will make Michigan one of only a handful of states with fear of voter district de ... what's the the kind of the split in terms of who is supporting these measures and who is opposing them is it kind of a partisan split or do you miss\nFires going to rain down from this guy it's ridiculous\nJennifer thanks for calling in Michael can you give us a little more context on prop one twelve particularly this couch or argument that ... says she's Jennifer ... she's been seeing on TV ads\nSure it will be a ... to put her finger point on it right now there are also a current setback distances which are\nA five hundred to a thousand feet depending on where where you are an ... supporters say supporters of on twelve say that the wells are just like Jennifer ... or to already too close to people's homes schools places work\nAnd that's a threat to their health because there are these are basically the industrial sites that are dangerous and uh the MIT pollutants um the oil so the other side of this is the oil and gas industry which is which is big in Colorado um they say I'm this measure would essentially run them out of business because\nUm it would be difficult to find sites that are twenty five hundred feet away for every potential new site ah but just how difficult that is will you know that's debatable the the state's oil and gas conservation commission\nUm did a study a is saying that as much as eighty five percent of new development would be halted a but there was an analysis from um another one of the Colorado School of mines that used a slightly different methodology\nAre taking into account possible drilling strategies and they came up with fifty eight percent so still in either case you know the industry says that's a lot of business for them that would be lost in with it\nUm there are jobs in a potential economic impacts um estimates are into the billions of dollars one real high estimate was four hundred and Seventy billion dollars\nUm but you know let's go back to the other side\nSmith was four hundred and Seventy billion dollars\nUm but you know let's go back to the other side as supporters one twelve um say that you know the industry's benefit to the state has fluctuated and decline in recent years and it it's now about five percent\nOf the state's economy here or there are about thirty thousand direct jobs um and ah you know they know that the um [noise] a current oil and gas operations those wouldn't be affected at all\nM.

Springs Texas earlier this year there was of course the church shooting in Charleston South Carolina a few years of a few years ago\nWhat is it about places of worship to make them such targets\n[noise] well I think one thing Joshua is that places of worship segregate people according to their religion and to some extent according to their ethnicity or race so\nIf you want to target Jews where would you go you go to a synagogue is going to be all Jews there if you want to target Muslims you can go to a mosque if you want to target black people and go to it a predominantly black church I mean so it's convenient in that sense you know in this in the sense that it allows the\nThe perpetrator to sort of zero in on the people that he wants to hurt\nIt's also really a challenge to their identity and if you really want to hurt those people go to their place of worship because that is obviously so central to who they are\nKind of an easy collection of targets kind of concentrated by what you want to target and also a soft target in the in the true\nSense yes exactly soft target you know I remember and I'm sure you do to going to church as a kid I mean there was a sense I'm not just as a kid for every ... of any age once you\nSo suffice it to save for northern and eastern Nevada and eastern California going to be pretty nice weather [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the

weekend's mass shooting in Pittsburgh\nAnd it's a question on the mind of the Reverend Adam Hamilton he's founding pastor of the nation's largest Methodist Church back in Nineteen Ninety he founded the church of the resurrection in Lee would Kansas that's suburb of Kansas City the goal was to attract what he calls thinking Christians with little or no engagement in their faith\nToday it has more than twenty thousand members across four campuses it's considered one of the most influential mega churches in the nation\nPastor Hamilton says that he has observed deep divisions within his congregation that reflect the nation's divides what's his plan to get people of faith\nThe nation's divides what's his plan to get people of faith thinking differently\nWe discussed it this summer when we were both in Aspen, Colorado for this year's Aspen Ideas festival here's the first part of our conversation Joshua what's great to be with you today thank you describe your congregation to United Methodist church of the resurrection in leave would Kansas or tell us about your ...\nIs a suburb of Kansas City we've got four campuses throughout Kansas City is a downtown Kansas City Missouri blue springs Missouri in a couple in the Kansas on\nAnd it's a very diverse congregation it's a highly educated the largely a highly educated we have um we did a poll that long ago we found out that forty nine point two five percent of our people are Republicans and fifty point seven five percent of our people are divided between independents and Democrats\nThe Republicans are divided between conservatives and ... you know conservatives on social issues and those were moderate progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally\nThe Democrats are largely moderate to a progressive and the independents are divided between Republican leaning independents and democratic leaning independent so we ever were pretty divided congregation and I think we represent the country you know fairly well they're kind of divided within divisions of the ... exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader\nSpeak about the issues that are happening in the world you know I'd I constantly have not constantly better regularly get emails from folks saying well you know you're being too political I Wish you and talk about politics and\nAnd I have to say okay wait a minute I'm not standing endorsing candidates I'm not even talking about the candidates but what you're calling politics I'm calling ethics and morals and values when we're talking about\nJustice issues we're talking about people who are being hurt we're talking about moral issues we're talking about ... and so if you think about what forms or politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on you know in radio spots or TV spots for a campaign or is it\nSecond soundbites on you know in radio spots or TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper sense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely you know I pray that when you're doing your politics you're doing that through the lens of a deeper moral system in a value system\nHow much do you as a as a pastor is a minister lean into the political debates\nAnd a religious lens on them as opposed to trying to have times where you may be lean away from them like I imagine there are some weeks where you think let's just do a sermon on you know tithing early and I just do a sermon on actually the story of the garden to be anything but politics\nSo here's a so for the folks who are upset by it they feel like I'm doing it all the time\nBut here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week and in particular in this than the Trump era there's always some you know big thing that's happened in the last week I Would be rewriting my sermon every ... every Saturday\nBased on what happened in the news that week and then probably Sunday mornings and and again probably Sunday Morning and so when I said it's a that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance\nAnd yet somewhere in the midst of those is preaching on these themes the things that are happening the news are going to come into play\nBut my aim isn't that I mean I I think people are hearing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to church I'm not sure they always need one more\nYear round of what they're already getting every day so what I'm trying to do is is carefully choosing where when are the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be said when there's a school shooting and even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so like I said we're going to talk about that a couple\nTo you know or violence in in our society so like I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the ... into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or one of the issues we're facing in our society and then we're going to take a look and see how\nYou know for it to be a sermon and not just a an ethical electing a lecture on ethics\nWe're gonna look to see how the scriptures speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things and when I Try to do the pressure I tried to take us to say okay I Know we are divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we're going to try to understand what might be the truth and this complex moral issue that this one side has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation then I'm going to say now you know with all the humility I can muster you can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but this is I see this issue right now [noise]\nGun guns as a as a great example of this and uh recently I preach the sermon on gun violence in schools I did a sermon on a on gun control and and gun legislation to a year ago\nAnd as I did that you know I surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measures that one can take to um to address the prevalence of guns and how easy access to them and\nAnd it was interesting how how many people agreed on both the left in the right on some of these basic things now that sounds like potentially risky ground because it begins to get out of spirituality and the actual policy yeah uh it does actually so so here we're talking about what would what would we as people of faith how how might we respond\nYou know the issues of shootings in the school so the shootings the schools is the presenting or just violence in our communities as a present\nAnd the school so the shootings the schools as the presenting or just violence in our communities is presenting issue and so and obviously there's no guns in the Bible but there are swords and spears so he got plenty of plenty of places where we talk about how do we respond to people who are our enemies we've got Jesus saying love your enemies we've got\nPaul talking about you know doing good to those that would harm you you know you've got a lot of things you could [noise]\nSo so there's a part of that that's going to be about those basic biblical principles but then there's going to be another part that's going to say so are there any solutions and is there any way that we as people of faith\nOn the left in the right can come together to find some solutions and in the end we found that more than two thirds of our people who were gun owners agreed with us or you know we lifted up four or five basic things that people said yes that that makes sense and in the end you know part of what we did as I said you know\nFor those of you know it's easy sometimes in the ... in the world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA are all gun toting nuts\nBut I I have friends and people who I loved dearly who are in the in our and they love to hunt and they're not gun toting nuts and they grieve every time there's a shooting in the school on the other side you know you've got these aren't people who want to take all your guns away\nThese are people who want to figure out we've got we've got to do something we got to come together so when you can when you can treat both sides as human beings and they help them hear each other it opens the door to finding answers\nWhat does your congregation want from its religious experience at your church do they want a place to deal with the social issues\nThat they want a refuge from the politics of the day do they just want you to stick to the scripture or do they want you to be more prophetic on the issues of our times what is your congregation expressing to you know the answer is yes [laughter] I don't know if I get emails\nAcross the spectrum I have people who are like you know I it just it makes me so mad when you talk about what's you know what's going on the news I don't want to hear about politics when it comes\nYou know I it just it makes me so mad when you talk about what's you know what's going on the news I don't want to hear about politics when it comes to church and again politics becomes the catch all phrase for something you said that I don't agree with and uh but I've got other folks were like so immigration on the border when a when the children are being separated or the news broke about that\nYou know I'm hearing this News I'm out of town I'm hearing this news throughout the week I'm studying it and I'm like do I talk about that this Sunday or do I spend another week really trying to see how that's going to resolve 'cause I have a feeling within a week it's going to be it will start to be resolved and sure enough within a week there was an executive order and it's not all resolved but\nAnd I had people who are really mad like why didn't you you should've preached on this this weekend and I had other people were like thank you for not preaching on this weekend and the next week and I did I did that was Father's Day we can talk about it but um\nSo I it's all over the map on that are there but here we we also serve the Carter whose originally find out we're doing at worship survey to find out about music and different things what they what they want but we asked about the sermons which the sermons or do you find most compelling and the number one response was when Adam deals with current issues where he's dealing with what's going on in the world\nBut for every person says that there's somebody else who's saying I Wish you wouldn't do that and you just stick to talking about love\nSpeaking to Adam Hamilton to founding pastor of the United Methodist Church of the resurrection in Lee would Kansas outside Kansas City is the author of more than two dozen books his latest is called unafraid living with courage and hope in uncertain times I Wonder pastor Hamilton how you see the United Methodist Church more broadly dealing\nThe Reno jazz syndicate performs each Thursday eight thirty to midnight at the loving cup won eight eight California

and to undergraduate degrees mission driven curriculum and the hands on approach Morris\nHe's mission driven curriculum and a hands on approach Morris co God ... ...\nWe've heard so much for many of you over your concerns regarding America's deep and deepening divide and again there's been a lot of criticism of the tone being sent by President Trump but it's not a one way street here are some of the messages you left in our inbox\nThis is Steve from suburban Park Maryland my concern is the constant resorting to violence and quote quote in your face politics and actions by both sides the left and the right the Dems and the Republicans\nFound the people out of restaurants is not a good way to start a good civil political discourse\nWas Tom from well I hear your focused on the political like when you seem to have more of violence benefiting the political left as an example Hillary Clinton thing but it will not be suitable until they are empowered what's the opposite of being civil bumping by\nMy name is Audrey I was in the synagogue when the shooter came in we need to stop teaching hate everyone who hates has been taught whom and how to uh rationally blame accused threatening target\nWe've lost some of the finest people in our community people always put loving and caring ahead of everything\nWe do is teach our children that for thousands of years we've been the targets and we expect that it will continue it's our job to be stronger and to keep trying to teach everyone a better way of life\nBut we've lost these particular tones on the campus of our congregations we've lost their chair and their laughter and their boundless optimism made their souls be bound and the bonds of life eternal we are greatly reduced without them\nYou're always welcome to add your voice to the conversation feel free to leave us a voice mail at eight five five to three six one a one a let's say five five to three six one to one to how we move forward as one is something we talked about was pastor Adam Hamilton he founded\nOne is something we talked about with pastor Adam Hamilton he founded the church of the resurrection which is America's largest Methodist congregation\nNow a recent study found that and Methodists or one of the nation's most politically divided denominations congregants and pastors are both split almost fifty fifty between Democrats and Republicans\nThat rising partisanship is particularly challenging for pastors like Hamilton and that's where we pick up the conversation\nHow do you help your congregation see themselves\nAs children of God first I think it's very easy today to just see people as jets and sharks this kind of political duality which to me is both boring and the humanizing right and it just negates the three dimension Audi of of humanity\nI Wonder how you as a faith leader especially with a gigantic congregation them\nHelp keep people seeing\nOne another in an equivalent way and and see through and around and pass\nThe politics yeah so that is something that\nWe talked about regularly and I try to model for them the modeling of treating people with dignity and respect and hearing their voices and not that they're all equal voices but just being able to treat people I mean the so and the drink juice ought to have sixteen had our our ... versus\nA do unto others as you have them do unto you I Hope you'll have this memorized already but if you don't we're gonna memorize that and I want you to think about that every time you have a conversation about politics\nWhat does it mean to do unto others as you'd have them do unto you and then there was a a ... I think I actually have three I think the second one was love your neighbors your love yourself so what does it mean to love your neighbor who's a Democrat or Republican or somebody across the our somebody's vote loves Trump or somebody\nTo love your neighbor who's a Democrat or Republican or somebody across the aisle or somebody's vote you know love Trump or somebody who hates Trump\nHow are you going to love them because you know in the end God God doesn't really care so much about what you thought about this or that President forgot yours deeply about whether you love your fellow human beings and John says if you can't love your neighbor who you can see how can you say your love of God you can't see\nAnd uh and so we talked about that in another one was a passage from Paul where he says let no evil talk come out of your mouth but only what is useful for building others up as there is need that your words might give grace to those who here and it's just a ... not only applies to your words out of your mouth but the ones you type in social media\nHow are you\nAllow your words to give grace to others as opposed to the humanizing them or you know so if you can\nFollow him on passed it on for some people who we just need to lead have it feels so good I mean really like we're having this debate about civility right now and I feel like it's just it's too satisfying\nTo take the moral high ground men say what you know those people whoever those people are right need the here and I have the answer and you need to hear it and this is America and doggone it it's my turn to talk and I'm tired of bite my tongue it just feels\nTo satisfy its uh finally let her out I think that's exactly right I think that's where we feel that we have to guard against I think it it naturally now there's not this isn't saying\nDon't share what you think but sharing what you think in a way that's reflects the humility like I could be wrong about this I don't think so but I could be wrong about this and that treats the other is a human being is really important\nAnd most of the time when we send those zingers out it feels really good and what if I'm quoting the Bible I Know one right 'cause it came out of the Bible\nYeah yeah yeah well that goes back to our question about the second ago about the nuances the Bible and how we read the Bible it's not quite as simple that cause I can pull out\nJust a second ago about the nuances the Bible and how we read the Bible it's not quite as simple that cause I can pull out I can pull a diverse and I can sing you with a thousand different versus that aren't really in keeping with the spirit of scripture but I certainly pulled out one verse out and made it made it saying\nHere's the thing especially when it comes to complex arguments political or moral arguments is you cannot have a complex argument\nIn two hundred and eighty characters on Twitter I mean thankfully they doubled the amount of space we as we went from a hundred and forty to two hundred eighty you can't do it you can't have those kind of arguments and you're you know a nifty responses on Facebook to somebody's post\nAnd you also when it comes to posting on Facebook to figure out how can I so here's the thing I I challenged people pastors across the country we talked about prophetic preaching and prophetic preaching has to do with saying the hard things you know in addressing justice in and righteousness all these things\nBut but when it comes to prophetic preaching I ask pastors you've got to decide do you want to irritate people are influenced them\nIt irritating people's easy it's just not hard to say something that's gonna hurt their feelings or irritate them or make the mad\nBut if you actually want to change somebody's mind or you want to influence their thinking you've got to figure out how do I do that so if you if you're on Facebook and you want to influence your family and friends who might have different views you got to say how could I Do that in a way that my mom who feel totally opposite of me might actually go well I hadn't thought of it that way before\nAnd that's why you know when it comes to preaching unconsciously issues I typically my approach is to say here's why thoughtful people on this side see this see it as well here's what level people in this I'd see it this way both quoting the Bible\nHere's where I come out I appreciate the folks on that side on this side I I find myself more compelled by this but if you're on the other side no how much I Love you I mean I've had people come and go I came in and I knew you were preaching this I was going to hate your sermon 'cause I kinda had a feeling where you're going to let it came in ready to\nCame in and I knew you were preaching this I was going to hate your sermon 'cause I kind of had a feeling where you're going to let it came in ready to hate oh yeah yeah but then the way you approached my side open my ears and my heart to hear what you had to say\nThat's gotta be hard for you though as a pastor I Know you're not trying to do harm no just personally in your own and I I Know I got to let you go shortly but in your own spiritual walk\nI Wonder how you are dealing with this as someone who has a tremendous responsibility over a huge congregation and who knows the obligation on a pastor and who's trying I'm sure trying not to hurt anybody and doesn't like being told I\nWas ready to start arming Iraq believe it or the\nBefore I let you go pastor Hamilton how are you dealing with this what's your spiritual walk like these days to be prophetic and helpful and resilient in these crazy time\nI actually feel like that's a a that's a part of the calling and how God is wired me so I I feel grateful to have a chance to do that and and I feel energized by having a congregation is divided and that I'm trying to help them hear each other and find a a I told them in a polarized country you know I feel like the church has a role to play in bringing healing to a polarized nation\nAnd we're we're a place it's are defining value was love\nSo if we can't figure out how to do this together in our congregation\nWhat hope is there for the world so I Want you to be in a small group or a Bible study or Sunday school class with people who disagree with you and I want you to figure out how do you listen to each other and treat each other as brothers and sisters and how do you come up with a stronger view a better view better informed because you've listened to both sides\nI mean seldom are issues that were really divided about as a country\nCompletely black and white ... if they were we wouldn't be divided everybody degree but instead there is some truth on both sides there and so so anyway I when I was younger and so I'm fifty up to ...\nSome truth on both sides there and so so anyway I when I was younger and so I'm fifty of turned fifty four next month when I was in my twenties and thirties every one of those letters just felt like an arrow driven into by heart it was so hard and I'd feel like I'd have to ratify paid response to them and I would stew on it for a long time you know and I was ready to quit if I got twenty of those you know emails in a week and\nAnd uh at fifty three almost fifty four I feel like it's okay", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city":
