man you don't know where you're a scientist your scientists that no no I haven't had ties to disagree with that you know I I was thinking\nWhat if he said now I've seen the hurricane situations I changed my mind that really is climate change and I thought wow what an impact\nWhat an ... I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about all that ... they say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael says that they say I mean they say that and the ... what about scientists and say it's worse than ever\nClearly climate change it's tough to discuss despite overwhelming scientific evidence of its existence\nOr maybe because of that evidence I mean think about it if someone tried to hit you over their head with a bunch of facts and figures Supreme Lee confident that they are right and you are wrong\nHow would you feel or if someone flat out refused to hear you out despite the facts being really clear and just dug in their heels to avoid feeling like they lost an argument\nDoug in their heels to avoid feeling like they lost an argument would that be like\nWe want to elevate this debate to change the way we talk about climate change and we want to hear from you where do you stand on the issue and what is it been like discussing it with people whose views are different from yours what's worked and what has not\nJoining us from K.

A. M. U.\nDot org we know that for quite a few if you're discussing climate change can be difficult\nSome of you been giving us your suggestions for what has worked for you or what might work Melissa writes for my Bible friends I remind them that we are called to be good stewards of the earth nothing the environmentalist or suggesting would cause harm\nNothing the environmentalist or suggesting would cause harm from my fiscally conservative friends I talk about the economics green power is more profitable and this is the future economy more jobs better jobs saving the earth for their grandchildren is way down on the list\nWe also heard from some of you who are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\nGroucho go that route actually than I Am and I'm saying and I'm very interested in protecting the environment and teaching others about\nClimate change\nI Want to know ways in which I can better explain myself to others are\nJust regular people who might not have the education that I had about climate change because from where I'm standing it plainly ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with his poll I Wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add to your comment the terminology often gets in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this it's a great point we\nTo recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy solutions with a policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to pay the global emissions by twenty twenty and go to\nKnow that we have to ... global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty year period then elects a president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people\nAbout the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinions on climate\nKatie emailed my family has vacation in Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he won't consider that just maybe there is a greater thing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening changed the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's really\nHow would you respond to Katie gosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in the last that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and\nYou know this is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information is like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me\nLike six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it people can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that is actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through um through relationship and trust and empathy um because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really base all emotion and fear anger um [noise]\nI anxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions we shouldn't into our part is in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSarah if I could just dig in a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little\nGive this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak to the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean it's hard not to read the latest report from the un climate change by which we discussed last week on this program and not feel like well we're all going to die anyway\nWhy bother run up your credit because they're not going to be around to collect you know what I'm saying like it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long way\nWell I Want to so yeah I got it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we sit\nWith the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that we're living a science fiction fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us\nAnd specifically in the U. S. Native American and indigenous Native American people\nWho have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at down the line and ... the the consequences from climate change we can look at the stories of human tenacity and how people struggle and survive\nThrough massive massive shift we know these stories and we can inform our strength and our resilience our courage by looking at the stories of for example the water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now saying the earth is precious we only have one planet and we're all going to show up and\nI'm informed that the you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place\nThat ... you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place and and staying vigilant\nI Would just go go ahead go ahead ... but oh I Would just add that\nFatal ism is a reasonable reaction if you don't know the full range of solutions\nThat there's a lot of good news here\nTwo years ago we eliminated one of them six main greenhouse gases it will no longer exist on earth Twenty years from now with the golly agreement to phase out HFCs\nTurns out there three or four other super pollutants like methane and black carbon if we can reduce these quickly about three times the current rate\nWe can limit near term warming and prevent run away climate change we need education about the fact that we can take hold of the climate crisis and actually solve it exactly to combat that fade listen which is a serious problem and I I really do feel empathy for people who are overwhelmed by it\nAnd Paul just to dig into a little further what our HFCs\nAgencies are hydro floor carbons are manmade gas that ironically are used in refrigeration oh in air conditioners\nAnd they're growing incredibly quickly because we phased out an earlier set\nOf CFCs chlorofluorocarbons to fix the ozone hole by the way it's worth noting that that happened under Ronald Reagan a Republican so also noting that the acid rain problem was solved under George W Bush a Republican Republicans have historically\nA Republican Republicans have historically taken very responsible positions on environmental problems but they've gone off the rails lately and we need to help them help them back\nTopic ... and ... happening tomorrow six PM ... under the rose brewing details Nevada

would love your help with tomorrow's program about being Native American\nMassachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along but she is indeed of tribal heritage the test was the clock back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders said direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard\nIt's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters talking head of the midterms ...\nIf you are Native American what has claiming\nThe midterms if you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant to you what tribe or are you part of and how does that factor into your life\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a now if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life what did you discover and how did it change you\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Sarah my ... and Paul blood so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on Noel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kind of like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shuts down and drains you\nNeed to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with the thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take large policy ...\nThat it will take large policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally to make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who acknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida um but\nThere are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace of the er at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation in a useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond\nTo that well I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] they have it in that um that that those protections\nThere is evidence that um that those protections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of projections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentration I mean we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nThat I I guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winter\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there is ... so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season out of different places are influenced\nBy the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why\nAnd people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for our planet has been awful lesions between ... glacial states\nAbrupt warming into into glacial followed by slow cooling into glacial states so that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by the changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sons\nOf Sarah backup dancers along on the changing geometric relationship between glacial into glacial stay last me it's so cool it's amazing what it's confusing like like bring it to nurse from it okay so in the last ... million years the the plants\nNurse for me okay so in the last million years that the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states where there's an eye on top of North American\nAnd you're Asian continent sea level is lower on it's a colder climate on and then in injure glacial state so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis on this piecing this um oscillation its ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and that heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat with paste\nBy the ... and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth tilt as it moves around the sun\nSo I only make sure I'm following you this yeah heartbeat this earth heartbeat but to be on hold too warm cold too warm\nIt's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat as off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that kind of what you're saying that's exactly right I like ... okay that makes a little full pattern\nThat's been ... that's been happening for the last million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern\nI yeah I was saying well we're on a super high cholesterol sugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof\nAnd um the climate system can't take that forever that will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to Paul and then we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say\nData's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work\nThrough that I I I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there is not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases their understanding the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now an imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed up a degree and a half Fahrenheit we're on our way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that that's just the factual information I I I think we went with very few people actually denied about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the U. S. public actually denied climate science would I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action\nPublished so former climate advisor for the Clinton White house process or your lecture at American University Center for environmental policy and a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute Paul thanks very much for talking to us thank you Josh\nAnd Sarah my re PHD research associate at the University of Washington and founder of the ... Institute Sarah thank you you're so welcome\nThere are good reasons to be concerned about our politics the division the tribal ties that seem to get in the way of us finding agreement and compromises we just discussed but\nWe're not alone no matter how fraud things maybe come here between now and the midterms at least we're not trying to work out a divorced that's lasted more than forty years and that will probably cost about fifty billion dollars\nThe the L ... dreaming online and K.

Native American voters thinking about for the midterms\nMuch more than what's happening with Senator Elizabeth Warren and President Trump their ongoing feud over Warren claiming to have tribal ancestry the senator has addressed her heritage in the past including at this year's National Congress of American Indians\nI get why some people think there's hate to be made here\nYou won't find my family members on any rules in I'm not enrolled in a tried and I want to make something clear\nI respect that distinction I understand that tribal membership is determined by tried and only by tribes my mother's family was part Native American and my daddy's parents were bitterly opposed to their relationship\nNow in the scheme of things does it matter if Senator Warren really is a verifiable tribal heritage clearly it does to her especially after the president referred to her as Pocahontas and said he would give a million dollars to the charity of her choice if she could prove or ancestry\nThat apparently led the senator to take a DNA test who's results she says prove that she is Cherokee\nThat drew criticism from tribal leaders like the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior who spoke on MORNING edition\nUm and then we're now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know\nAnd then we're now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nAh means by which you are a Cherokee citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for a senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA I really undermines tribal interest frankly\nOn top of that the test did nothing to stop the presidents insults he tweeted quote\nPocahontas the

U. dot org we heard from quite a few of you who shared your stories\nAbout exploring your tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nHi Sheila this is Carol elaborately ah I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to uh that we were part of the Choctaw tribe in Oklahoma we applied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted\nAnd it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um\nWe can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us more ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but\nTribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back um ah through time\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community is one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important one of the things I Love to think about as a shoney's once hunted bastard on\nHunted mastodon\nHunted vested I think about that long arc\nYeah yes it's a I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back\nMillennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture\nAre there other kinds of benefits that you find when did their intrinsic or extra benefits\nOf being an acknowledge member of a tribe that are worth protecting that are worth keeping their proper places I mean Carol talks about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our ... our our children are native languages are traditions are land\nThe water and the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA test is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're ...\nTest is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native\nYou know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it they take our language and they can modify it they take our spirituality and modify it and they make money\nThey make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of the family lore or they speak with some ... mugging titled meant\nLike they've lived the life of a native like somebody's ever called them an engine or a our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies at the door even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nI should know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kits the ones that say find out your ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October Seventeen we did it on October Eighteenth of last year called ... where do we come from where we spoke to a geneticist\nAre named Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about what DNA can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you were going to do one of these home DNA tests\nYou'll find that conversation with Adam referred on our website the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org\nBrittany tweeted I Am a county and kick Hanukkah or mohawk and I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help native issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nUA progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchised\nNot talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focus on this\nProgressive she must have known why we both Kerry living 'cause we're going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you were in progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell North Dakota\nHas a voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court\nDecided to essentially let it go into effect for the November election so what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger\nPolls have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve setting the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had\nA very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American and so this voter id law\nCould potentially fall heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed it because they said that the north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nAnd what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential streets\nThe law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box is they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient\nSo if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that idea used in the primary is no longer good for the general\nElection a lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has that been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also\nBecause the the state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even at ... vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a voter die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast valid and the wrong precinct would this would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if you're a mailing address the somewhere different than where you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population there reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether you are in North Dakota or elsewhere love to hear from your your North Dakota but email is one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nToyota but email is one a X. W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one eight or comment on our Facebook page Jerry what did you hear from people in North Dakota about how this law is affecting them is this on people's radar is is kind of more of a a smaller as\nI say it is and also you have to put a link against the larger contact\nOr you'd see it as it is a big issue where does this ...\nOh I think it's really on people's radar absolutely an issue and I also think there's some context around it when I was reporting from North Dakota from the Standing Rock reservation which is in North and South Dakota but the north Dakota part is affected by this\nUm ... you know really one of the things that I was interested in one of the reasons I went there even before the Supreme Court ruling is because voter turnout there is the lowest in the state it\nWas the lowest in the state before this and that's because\nThere are challenges that people their face and getting to the polls so I I think you have this law now becoming a new complication for this election that has the potential to drive turnout even lower and you have people reacting to that their their excuse me their tribal governments and nonprofits\nLearned more at S.

I I have no context for dealing with tribal populations in politics and you said there is quite an array of diversity among the tribes that would that you would be representing\nIn Congress can you give folks just a sense of what it's like to try to represent the issues of all those different groups do you find that there is a handful of issues the kind of overlap every one or do you really have to be sensitive to what this tribe is asking for versus what that tribe is asking for and and we're the differences are\nSure I mean I think there's some of that ... ... absolutely there's there you know they'll they'll be some competing issues along the way but but really I'm land water\nUh our environment is all I mean that's sort of\nA ... those are issues that transcend\nUm you know tribal lines so to speak to issues that that all of us are concerned about and so I'm so I'm I'm a lifelong environmentalist and you know I I'm a I'm somebody who used to go down to the\nTo the field with my grandfather and\nLifelong environmentalist and you know I I'm a I'm somebody who used to go down to the\nTo the field with my grandfather and weeds and pick worms off of corn um so I Know I understand the value of clean water and clean land to our people and I think that is that's an issue that transcends a lot of tribes across the country\nUm but you know the issues you were talking about earlier with voting that that is that's definitely an issue that all of us care about as well because we deserve a to have a voice at the table that's something I've been fighting for for a long time I've I've been getting out the vote in Indian communities for nearly Twenty years\nBecause I've always felt that we should have a say in who are elected officials are so\nUm so that's a passion of mine as well\nAnd and I want to work to make sure that that our voices are always heard in that respect\nI don't want to keep you too much longer but I Do wonder what you make of this larger surge of Native American candidates this year ... what do you think is behind that\nWell of course I mean it's a you know it's hard to say exactly but I mean there we can because we've had you know we've had a\nAdvocates and and you know we've had protest for centuries right we we've always been on the ground\nA fighting for I'm fighting for something that we feel we deserve and and that's been true whether it's fishing rights water rights land rights um those have always you know been hallmarks of our\nYou go where the K U and our mobile app on your smartphone and we're streaming live a K when our daughter\nIs losing or gaining weight represent to you for one author it represented things he avoided talking about but ultimately had to say\nFrom W.

U. dot org\nLet's read one more eggs or from the book this is about\nLet's read one more eggs or from the book this is about something that happened to you and your mother or when you were younger not real far from here in Maryland and it is on page eighty one would you mind reading from it's about halfway down patriots won the part that begins when we were half a mile from home\nSo almost the end of page eighty three which ends with the word flying would you read that first please\nA sure anyway offers only rents are okay\nWhen we were half a mile from home a Maryland police cars stopped us just like when they stopped us in Mississippi you set up in your seat kept ... kept both hands on the wheel and looked straight ahead\nYou took out your University of Maryland I D and took my red black and green African medallion into my public enemy T shirt you told me to sit up keep my hands on the dashboard don't say a word\nOfficer now down and lifting your window when I saw your face so close to his gun I Want it to snatch it and watch it melt into black grits evidence police started approaching me more often and Mississippi I wanted to super power to melt every gun in the world and the black grits officer asked why we had in Mississippi license place\nBecause we are residents of Jackson, Mississippi you say I have a post doctoral appointment at the University of Maryland College park how 'bout done anything wrong officer\nWhen officer told you to speak up and claim your change lanes without signaling you kept your grip on the steering wheel and said I did not change lanes without signaling you spit up behind me so I signaled and change lanes officer tried to laugh in your face as he asked for your license in registration\nLaugh in your face as he asked for your license and registration is that your man he asked you he needs to show some identification to\nYour hands came up to staring well and you pointed at the officers face move away from my car you said that as much how he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification I mean I have your badge number please\nI hated how it sounded when you didn't use contractions the officer as both of us to step out of the car we will not get out of his car you said louder this time\nWe have done nothing wrong my fist were bald up and I was engine toward the driver's side window you slapped me across much that's what the back of your hand and told me to be quiet and unconscious surface right as another officer pulled up the first officer who is now laughing walk back to the second officers car\nYou eventually showed a second officer you license and your University of Maryland id\nOfficer looked at the id flipped it over and told us to have a good night never give them a chance to take a shot you finally said after we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it they will take it I wondered why you said it three times and why you never told me to shoot back\nMississippi Marilyn it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot your black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you kill yourself\nI hear you I told you and try to make you laugh why don't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't and they instead of their though if I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us you said\nIt's more likely that officer might have shot us you said we wouldn't I told you that fool got matter because you were speaking correct English you looked at me like you were thinking you might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English they view though\nI Do not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you I'm an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop gave me in a bubble guts you laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't\nWhile I was in my room changing you told me to write about what I learned from the experience with the police I wasn't sure what the right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seem like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cutting a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky\nAnd the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting they were just the only people allowed to walk around and threaten us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style of fly\nOther eggs or for heavy bike here say leave and there is a lot\nGoing on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it yeah\nI mean that's the crux of a lot of uh the relationship our talk about in this book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to had to go to a new ...\nAbout a situation where we went to had to go to a new school in eighth grade was the first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd a few my best friends from a previous school were there and one of my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way he did every morning when we were at a school in Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told them put the knife away treated the knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers grandmothers and in that situation I learned that sometimes in off in a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so I my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not giving them a chance to look like\nEating a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out to the library without checking it out\nThat got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this this a theory my mom had the you know you conduct them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to home life when you spend your entire life outside of the home anticipating white supremacy and white power doing un that's the question I'm trying to asking this section and also in the entire book\nWhat did happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom as you were trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you were trying to understand them how did that affect your relationship with her yeah one one way I think\nA lot of just traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful\nJust traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful that my mother was telling me things some things that were raised some things that were wrong um she started to be a a a lot more active in trying to police to me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more [noise]\nUm but and we could talk about those things sorted we could talk about police we could talk about white people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about with like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different relationship\nBut I Would never talk to her about that fight in our protection she saw me and relationships that were like difficult for me where I was being bad to myself where I was mistreated people emotionally we didn't know how to talk about any of it so while we're doing really good sort of talking about how we survive outside of the house\nThe particular kinds of violence as they were happening in my house were completely silent we never knew how to talk about it and it's so you know it took me until I was like forty to forty one years old to have the guts to actually write into some of what was happening in our house and try to connect that to what was happening outside of our house I Want to\nTalk more about your literary style but I did want to point out one other aspect of the anecdotes you just read\nWhere the officer looked at you and said who is that is that your man there's also this through line about people presuming that black boys are older than they are it was a factor in the shooting of to me or rice the young man who was shot dead in Cleveland, Ohio back in November of twenty
