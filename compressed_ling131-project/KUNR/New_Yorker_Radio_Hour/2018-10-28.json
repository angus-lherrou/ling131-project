I was a rebellious Christian\nNow you're also interested in musicals and musical theater and did you have access to that or was it all through records in radio\nI didn't have access to musical theater and what else did you play as we get our Cinderella I can totally how we did we did a production or I went to a predominantly all black a high school Latina a Latino and black high school and\nUm you got all the leads to you I didn't actually it's funny when did you not get the lead the whiz I did not get the whiz I wanted to be Dorothy so\nYou're still mad about it [laughter]\nI'm I'm kind of deal but I understood it but it crushed me growing up it really crush me\nNow at what point did you think I can have a big life like something that's beyond being in the high School Musical\nA big life like something that's beyond being in high school musical something beyond being a maybe the best singer at your high school something larger than that\nI don't think I registered until I went to New York post high school I went to the American musical dramatics academy\nAnd I started to learn more and I started to grow\nAnd when I realized that there was more potential that I hadn't tapped into there was an access potential that was there\nAnd that led me to leave I left school because I realized that I wanted to tell fresher stories are we are heroes at that time Lauren Hill Lauren Hill was my biggest inspiration\nAnd I love Judy Garland yeah arguing Judy Garland were were my my my heroes\nAre pretty different performers why those two\nThey were just women that I felt really use their voices you need to have a first of all unique tone\nUm and they just came across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland\nObviously I'm from Kansas and the wizard of Oz you know in her being in that um I felt like she was a dreamer and she was a strong woman I Know she had a complex life\nBut Lauren Hill in particular I resonated with me as a black woman who did an album and made a career fully being herself she did not shy away from her religious belief she didn't shy away from 'em you know being a mom during a time where people say that she could not\nHave a child who were ruined her career um she she was an actress she was an actor she was a finger ah she was a producer she was a poly math and now is how I wanted to model my career now\nShe was a ... and that was how I wanted to model my career\n... ... ... what's your song from an early album it's called ... stars happy hunting and this is from an album called metropolis betray sweet\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nYou know in a long time now that sounds like something out of out of a musical is that what you said that's right\nYes you know what well I wouldn't say a musical where I wanted to do was to figure out how I could sing songs\nHave concepts for them if I wanted to talk about science fiction which was a huge inspiration to me after I watched Fritz Lang Nineteen twenty seven German expressionist silent film\nWhen I watched that metropolis Oh yes it it it ends or all of my work really it was the birth of metropolis the money that by the stars have the hunting that we just heard but what I wanted to do is figure out how to you take how can I take all of me onstage like am I Am theatrical I Love singing love R B I Love rock and roll\n'em I Love you know dressing in black and white tuxedo to pay homage to my family I Love\nDavid Bowie I just got into boy at that time I loved pink Floyd the ... the wall I Love\nA Isaac Asimov I Love science fiction how can\nThe wall I Love a Isaac Asimov I Love science fiction how can I blend all these these ah these different elements in and innovate in in in the space of of of music\nYou had in those in those early days an alter ego Cindy may whether white it's not that you were hiding behind her but you were projecting this self which was um\nA a complicated thing which all that you are [laughter] um why use her as it were instead of being yourself and as you are now in in the in the latest um dirty computer\nWas saying that Cindy Mayweather represented represented aspirations for me [laughter] that's who I strive to be more like I'm not so she is in the future and in the future she's more evolved and she doesn't have eagle all the things that\nMake me imperfect she's able to master those\n... it so this is a ... a self critical expression by having an alter ego yes somewhere absolute what we're used to being self critical about in your in your younger self\nWell my younger self I just felt a misunderstood a lot of people will call me weird they relied right oh that's not commercial enough they didn't under they just did not understand how they were going to market or what it was it I was doing and just\nWhat do they want you to be [noise] I don't think it was about\nWanting me to be something I think it was really about not wanting to do the work in the development that it would take to figure out how to bring something new to the industry it was like the quick thing would be well you know change your hair one change her outfits need is sexually be appealing\nHere one change her outfits need is to actually be appealing a the songs also that you know they shouldn't be so dense they should be more simple and assess a bowl and\nBut the temptation to fold must have been something financially and in terms of fame and all the things the rewards for the record industry can bring the temptation to kind of compromise a lot must have been significant\nOh yes oh my goodness are you kidding me I'd just been fired from Office Depot because I was responding back to one of our ah three fans that I had at the time I was singing on the library steps living in the house with six other girls in a boarding house\nUm you know driving my Mitsubishi ... he's outta my trunk I needed I needed money you know I needed to to be on growth field yes I Would ever want to go home what would you do it Office Depot\nSelling ink and you were better ...

and bishop this is Kay you win our public radio row\nWe'll come back to the New York\nWe'll come back to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick the mid term elections are often said to be a referendum on the presidency and that's never been more true than this year in the era of Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there are also other issues on your mind as a voter local stuff\nThat is maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter Eliza Griswold has been spending a lot of time following races in the state of Pennsylvania and what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state thing that's foremost on people's minds is a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes through a lot of people's backyards\nAnd they're really unhappy about it one of the communities allies visited was exton Pennsylvania in the suburbs of Philadelphia [noise]\nAfrican is a place where two tectonic plates in American politics me we thought Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty six teams in the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans and al ... is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance we gone rogue\nWere on a leafy suburb and straight their colonial houses which are made of brac inside in the final it's a middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is going door to door she's a suburban mom of two kids under the age of five\nAnd she works in marketing I have you heard about running for office\nShe works in marketing have you heard about running for office Danielle excuse orange around you do okay well I actually live right on Devon drive and I decided to run because for the last five years our neighbors here than dealing with us\nWe how she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fencing that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Daniel to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on a Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party um there are\nOne two three four five six rows of\nPipes it's within five fifty feet in my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and um we're standing right now ten feet from playground that my neighbors kids my kids play on your\nGreatest fear is Danielle with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impact how do your fears about an impact your life um [noise]\nIt's horrible to think about a couple of weeks ago I'm a pipeline exploded in India for county in Pennsylvania and it was a smoker pipeline that was only a week old and so I actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare\nOf like my babies like burning in their bed\nAnd I'm I called them and I said we have to move like you have to move we can't keep 'em and like thankfully in beaver county there were only thirty homes\nAnd like thankfully in beaver county there only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless destroyed um\nThose things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality [noise]\nSo you know we're here trying to connect some of the dots between what's going on politically nationally as well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics\nJust an example of [noise] the egregious ness\nOf what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs and how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone\nLet's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occur to me it just wasn't something\nLike maybe I thought it would\nRun for school board or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but after all of the things we've experienced over the last few years and just the lack of humanity from are the people who represent us\n[noise] it's it's ... it it makes you feel powerless but I refuse to be powerless\nOpponent and district one fifty five is Becky carbon a Republican has been in office since two thousand twelve I reach representative Corbin for an interview and she sent the following statement\nI Am a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure that\nI have a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community then she lifted her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\nBut here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics in both the Republican legislature and the Democratic governor Tom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking has made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing\nState in America and\nAnd that's brought in a lot of different players including to know go and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nWhen we build a pipeline safety or top priority for highly skilled engineers environmental scientists wildlife biology and geology design or probably want to follow the safest round with the smallest environmental footprint\nATP is a private corporation but they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline\nThe pipeline moves natural gas liquids\nFrom the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the eastern markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas we were following the root of the pipeline through Pennsylvania our second stop with a hundred miles west of accident in the small town of blows or fail at blooms\nGun shop we not Ralph and Doris blue\nTheir shop as a small building in a modified garage on their property or shot guns are mixed up with things stun guns in the interests and its infested was quick to thirty\n... was quick to thirty five years to make a junkie like it is that it ain't going to do you think going to get any better city called him a pipeline\nWent right through their property and they say edit killed their high and ruin their drinking water\nBut we have no water we have another drink and water for doing because we haven't had recognized drink or two thousand and Seventeen there's or water behind it that we got back then that's the way it come out of the ticket it's black and\nAnd nobody plain words because he was maligned would\nGet his grade I went to hike or burger which is our state senator three times\nFor help nothing went to the blue more representative I think three times nothing the last time I went to bloom I took him to bottled water over and showed him how to drink this is what it is he actually come out and looked at the damage to did\nAnd nothing just don't do nothing\nI reached out just to know go to comment on issues related to the pipeline but they didn't respond Ralph as a registered Republican but he voted for Hillary Clinton in the last election because he said she would have been good for the gotten [noise]\nHe and his wife Doris gave us a tour of their property on their four wheelers we wrote up a hill pass their house and surveyed their hay fields [noise]\nMountain over that law as we can see where it's clear cut through the trees yeah tons all the way down

would us back\nOff and maybe see a a life long line up yeah well ... yeah well we want to be telling you\nIt was so too it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach aesthetic the problem\nIs that that's a little if he says no it doesn't have a Venice Beach for some reason he's offended by that formulation it's ... it's her judgment summit\nOffended by that formulation it's ... it's her judgment\nSo maybe you could just say like a California beaches static um\nNephew to end with this will set up a job interview she wrote a switch careers I don't know like they have a much easier job right now [laughter] so less pressure\n\nAfter I saw that Daniel ... had a good from of course grasp on what was ... what was not I walked around the corner to help him work with Parker Henry another
