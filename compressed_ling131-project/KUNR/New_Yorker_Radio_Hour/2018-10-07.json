America right now this is very much the subjective Rebecca Traister his new book good in mad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe book and binds a kind of history of women's uprisings with an analysis of the me too movement\nTraister is written for New York magazine el the New York times in the Washington Post and her last book was called all the single ladies unmarried women and the rise of an independent nation Rebecca Traister and I spoke on the very day that Christine Blasey Ford and\nBrett Kavanaugh both testified about her sexual assault allegations Rebecca there's\nNo way to avoid this we are talking now just hours after the Senate Judiciary committee has done its questioning ... there was a very specific story being\nTold by professor Ford as well as as as we near us and others ... very particular meal you as well what did the specifics tally\nThe specifics of their stories yeah well we are getting a very full and detailed view of cultures around wealth white\nCultures around wealth white\nFundamentally patriarchal power centers that begin in you know when people are teenagers the prep school the the you know Deborah Ramirez is story which was about how she was an outsider to this very elite\nUm friday hard drinking badly behaved relatively repercussion free um social circle of extremely wealthy privileged white men who were all on have tournaments power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young in a responsible I was young in a responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of a power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement it's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nIt's sort of invisible right oh oh he was a drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg leg wouldn't have an behave that way it's like an discernible as harm in some way\nIn your book good mad you write very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf but more often about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this case\nWhat about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this country how it was built and who would still excludes and systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter]\nUm this book is in large measure about anger the legitimacy of anger or the ... of anger historically toward toward good um what's that you often\n[noise] um it was an attempt to\nGet my thoughts clear after the election I was um that take some doing oh God yes [noise]\nI didn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean\nI was very muddy about what the story was that I needed to tell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before and\nUm there's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women I was acutely aware of my identity\nUm as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been lingered by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think\nMore clearly about race and class um that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer and there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a pod cast with a bunch of women\nAnd one of them had said about the white young white men who was like the classic Bernie supporter like\nShe had said something like where are you guys out there trying to to persuade people to vote for Hillary because it's your guys as white men who are not voting for her where the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise\nTwo boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware of this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument\nWhich is like leaving beat it is not worth the investment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women do not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be Phyllis Schlafly right I understand and have sympathy you\nWith that like just let 'em right right and they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them and that oppressive other people great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys without going in my own head\nAnd I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also think about white women and what impulses and messages or work on white women\nAnd um I felt like it was my responsibility to examine race from the perspective of of waiting is in conjunction with looking at gender and then the anger so I I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how to do it right I I and that was the question about my work how do I do that what do I do what is my job what's ... what's the story here\nBut everything was so crowded [noise]\nAnd I was on a walk with my husband um between Christmas and New Years of that year says twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was feeling about like not knowing what my role was supposed to be what it was what was my work going to be professional professionally\nAnd um I said I just can't think straight dries I'm I'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is\nI'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is\nAnd I said what do you mean and he goes well maybe that's what you need to write about is anger and as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what\nBut suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months since\nIt is interesting that the law to the exemplars of\nConstructive anger in the book historically a black woman mhm I'm Shirley Chisholm\nFlorence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours I'm In her great hats or Rosa Parks and in and of course the the mother of Emmett Till that's not by any coincidence that's not that's not by accident\nNo not at all women of color have often been\nNot only the leading activists organizers and the the people who who first gay voice in forum to a lot of the transformative social and political movements that have that have reshaped America\nUm they also often have done the thinking I mean ... poly Murray who somebody I write about in this book Polly Mary was credited\nBy both Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the intellectual work she did laying out the framework for racial and gender inequity in this country and and laying the groundwork for the laws that would ultimately wind up I'm protecting\nAnd uh try to ameliorate the kind of gender and racial inequality that she was she was trying to address she's still very rarely credited as this leader um\nAnd Florence Kennedy I haven't heard the name Florence Kennedy in years I mean she's very much of the generation of Gloria Steinem or little even if she wins\nMuch of the generation of Gloria Steinem are leaving either she ... she and she and Gloria Steinem we're speaking partners caught on the road again right to tell us a little bit about four it's kind of so Florence\nKennedy was a ... a black feminist lawyer um she was outrageous\nFor her time but I think she would be outrageous now I like soccer in her demeanor and her willingness to\nBe vocally pro family\nUnapologetically enjoy fully pissed off about everything she was pissed off [laughter] and there was a lot of it she was mad about racism she was mad about sexism and she wasn't going to play nice at all\nYou know you wrote a book about a time when you're you're working in a male dominated office uh-huh and you found yourself in two years you're angry and you're crying until you write a chili hard asked manager those are includes a woman\nPulled you into a stairway and said you they don't know you were furious they think you're sad\nAnd we'll be pleased because they've got to you when we were we were what was going on [laughter]\nUh was at the New York observer um I don't I've never talked about this with a woman who said it and I don't know if she were even remembers um and I don't remember to be honest I don't remember what I was angry about um I mean I can take guesses but um I was\nThe thing that was astounding to me is that\nThis is a person who had always intimidated me because she wasn't there was nothing outwardly emotional no sense that she was paying close attention to the experiences\nThe people she was just she was incredibly efficient incredibly talented manager of people [noise] um and a copy [laughter] and the ...\nI'm an of copy [laughter] and the fact that she saw in sort of what was a split second something that I wouldn't have been able to describe as soon as she said it was like I Am furious of course of course I'm Crying because I'm furious I think that's such a common experience for women\nWhat's what this means that we can get the money is we've been talking about taking out of it [noise]\nWe've been talking about

Maryland\nRobinson recorded his calls was Stuckey suggesting that he might have been suspicious and yet for over a decade up to the time of his death\nHe sent Stuckey hundreds of thousands of\nDollars
