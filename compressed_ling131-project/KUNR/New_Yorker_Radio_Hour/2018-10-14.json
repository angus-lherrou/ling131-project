{"month": "10", "state": "NV", "station": "KUNR", "content": "In what she's found should scare us all Logan lamb\nIs a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election it started poking around the Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nOr in the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... election dot Kennesaw dot edu or Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website\nAnd generally that turns up reports or public presentations\nAnd this this particular search didn't\nTurn that up instead I found a very curious link and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or names in some sort of identify her next to their name and I immediately thought while that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and and what he found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor\nTim these documents contain supervisor passwords to be used on election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I thought to myself while this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself will be a huge story but on top of that land also found security hole through which you could download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their addresses birthday last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number\nAnd then there were also gyms databases and uh gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count\nIf Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bonanza that is\nThe scariest scenario I can think of would be\nAn attacker implanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic pull books were altering the voter registration databases to disenfranchise voters\nAn attacker could have compromise that Web server and used it as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise] this is right\nHer into the center for election comes about works this is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system\nTo protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally\nPatched then more information started to trickle out [noise] the intercept published the\nNSA report that had been hacked about Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nLook we have no idea of the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know but this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence that the warning lights are blinking red some states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand that they need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts Susan green hall is the policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right um so I Wonder if you could just\nLots of election machines left and right um so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia\nAre computerized touch screen voting machines\nGeorgia is one of five states that entirely has machine that don't have a paper ballot then there's also other machines which count paper ballots those are all the computers and those machines can be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted correctly\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors at these machines insists that they're not really ...\nBecause they're not connected to the Internet and I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWell many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location\nThat computer to the voting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing a programming gets infected with malicious offered it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that debunked that assertion which is that in many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless modems to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and those cellular networks are part of the Internet\nWe spent a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies but there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to\nDo with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia that purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections or whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base [noise]\nThis has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names weren't on the voter rolls or they they endured county they use electronic pull books\nAnd people were showing up and they were being told you're at the wrong polling location or you've already voted during early voting or you already voted absentee or your name as in\nEarly voting or you already voted absentee or your name is in here or your address has been changed the vendor\nFor the electronic pull books was a vendor named the our system now the our systems had been targeted by a Russian intelligence spear phishing attack\nAnd um the state board of elections did their own investigation or as did the county to county report has been made public it wasn't very in depth that didn't consider a cyber attack 'em and concluded that it was a poll worker or malfunctions\nBut I think that's an open question as to what happened in North Carolina on election day [noise]\nWe heard earlier in the year that a three hundred and eighty million dollars was being released to the states\nUh for election security uh can you talk about that like is that gonna make a big difference in the midterms in twenty twenty at all\nSo there was three hundred and eighty million dollars was a appropriated\nA under the health America vote act from two thousand two so there were no specific security strings put on it you have to do this or you have to do that with the money and there's a lot of states are using that money to good effect to try to bulk up their security profile um [noise]\nBut it would be really useful to have some federal legislation to move the states to those remedies that we know are so central to his caring or elections\nAre you worried about the kind of legitimacy of of our election system and even\nAnother well\n\n\nThat's the beauty of beauty isn't it ... do you ever ... you say you were texting with a known about the songs that did you how much do cheese out\nWhat the song is about oh I didn't I didn't need to I mean for me for me it's mostly about climate change no\nBut you've you've been through a certain number of political moments [laughter]\nBut you've you've been through a certain number of political moments [laughter] sixties and in many moments in between ... and just how does this seem similar different\n[noise] um issues I couldn't have dreams is up all the stuff I've been through and all the countries no dictatorships and the you know I'm In through all that if somebody is hit said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil and it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero embassy so um it leaves you believe me thinking how am I going to conduct my life\nIt's you know it's the year the bully and um to bully people now seems to be okay the lying no problem no perjury and not a problem um and said that that is a new normal\nAnd how has it changed the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning as yeah proceed through the day well I think\nI mean I've heard other people say this to the law oftentimes as hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize that it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety\nAnxious about the state of the world which is terrible and so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial vents and be granted valley yeah\nAnd um don't expect much I mean keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary ... forget which one it was because of this\nI was just watching a documentary you get forget which one it was because\nThe scene appears in so many documentaries of you singing at the march on Washington and I I I just wonder how you\nVisualize and you remind moments like that in your life which are now distant and their iconic in the minds of other people but you you're there you're holding the guitar you are in a microphone and it's kind of lousy sound system and seen it was a half million people or whatever it was\nDo you think about these moments in your past and you know I think\nAs I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph I think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said um and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know it\nUm in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah yeah\nYou you mean there's some there's some times a year in the middle of an event that turns out to be a comic and you have no idea\nI think festival a political moment yeah\nI'm I was just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last helicopter in and looking down and seeing these people are like aunt you know they're just gobs of people\nAnd so I had a hint then of that this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever\nAnd in yours and mine yeah\n... you know this next song that you're going to do I went to um\nCharleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these these ... relatives with people who lost people in the church there in this in this slaughter and it it was\nChurch there in this in this slaughter and it it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed\nUm that President Obama went to it seems like a million years ago it does the idea of a of a president I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that\nNot only is the crowd with him in the field they feel like allies but he's able to sing the song I Begin the song yeah that lift people up as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses hello [laughter] um yeah how do you remember that\nThat terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the so\nWell covering this song it was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them or in the future\nThat song just dropped out of the sky shouldn't by the way Milford I did not know and most people didn't know and\nI Need to tune that didn't get to architect\nI mean if I was Quaker a tune that you can only be knocking that guitar and you're killing on not can you hear hearing it loudly\nAnd they just go ahead yeah okay Mm\nMm [noise] [noise]\nMm Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nYoung men came to our house a Frenchman they didn't know anyone brought him he\nWas not friend he was not keen but now when they're doing\nAnd they let him Maine and foreign our this strain\nThey let him me\nAnd for an hour the strangers they did he sat with them many seem to print any\nBut then a young man to God and nine people weren't on young\n...\n... ...\nIn Charlotte in the month of June Mm some mourners gathered in ... the president came to speak some were\nAnd the cameras roll and the nation on her\nNo one could\nSay what must be in a bar all the living and and and\nSo on that day and then that\nRaising gravy the president is saying oh maybe ...\n... ...\n... ...\n... ... ... Mm\nWe argue lay the blame on one man's hanging around nation shame some sickness but the minute or so and how it might be made oh\nNo no one could\nSay what must be said for all the living and\nSo on that day and then he's the president sang\nAmazing\n... my president and sad\nHang on a man thing in my president sang a man thing right Mm\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] wow [noise] yeah [noise] the last line is my president which is this just switch yeah for that presidents in by president he says is the only president you felt of this and that way but\nUm yeah and I had to decide whether I was going to use that are not cause though we wrote it um my president I thought ... [laughter]\nAnd all of them they have to lie cheat and steal do all that stuff [noise] um but yeah be states' money was smart he was carrying in spite of whatever the wars were you know and there were some Afghanistan you know I'm border crossings [noise]\nUm a lot of it it was just somebody I liked I like\nUm ... uh yeah I met him I was in the middle of a snowstorm and it was just ... and I went and I met him when I had was freezing out and my feet had shrunk and I couldn't keep my high heels on they stuffed things in there for me you know like cotton why are you\nWere high heels to the ... very cold\nThat I kicked him off and went barefoot [laughter] lose all your age your feet shrink and you're going to be slipping and make noises all the way to the president so I went barefoot and made him very happy\n[laughter]\nYou totally embraced the\n[laughter] you\nTotally embraced the idea of political songwriting and um it's connection to politics a connection to the social world Bob Jones or the other thing he ran away from it he wrote some of the great political yeah songs of the time and then did his very best to either\nReject the label or pretend to I've never it's hard to make sense of it now I Do I take him at his word ... what did you make of that the kind of wanting to be distant from masters of war and saying I you know it would be great for the kids was over cell or what is there without\nIn many ways he enjoying a we're opposites uh she hates the cold or she could think of any more dreadful place in the world in Antarctica\nDreadful place in the world in Antarctica\nYet for all their differences they shared a similar sensibility\nHe really was a tree romantic he loved poetry he loved ah he he did tapestry\nHe's ditch the most wonderful tapestries\nTastes legit skating across the snow\nHe loves the history of all these old explorers and heat glamorize that allied said his head and\nWe're in faith that there was no\nHenry worshipped Ernest Shackleton who in many ways a was a failure as and explore on his first expedition that he commanded some self\nHe set out to reach the south pole with three other men they got within Ninety seven miles nautical miles to the poll but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would not make it back\nThose four men for my mother\nAnd so I made a decision that always astonished hadn't even worse Lee\nHe decided to turn back\nThe way that we of it\nAnd his other ... most famous expedition a Shackleton had wanted to walk across Antarctica he thought it was the last great prize to be achieved but before even reached Antarctica his ship the difference\nThat frozen in the eyes and Shackleton found him in all his men were ruined on an ice flow more than a hundred miles from the closest I've been with any contact with civilization what made it so amazing was she was\nIt's either with any contact with civilization what made it so amazing was he was able to guide all the men in his immediate party and get them back all home alive\nI Know that they have the very core I I Believe I'm\nFour years I was very interesting Charles golf so major story actually reach out to be really good stories and cars are very very divided expeditions\nHe began to burn with this very peculiar ambition would pray future which was the kind of suffer these misery and become a polar explorer and the model that he lived by with a Shackleton family motto which was by endurance we conquer\nI should have had ... bells when he came back from a trip to says Georgia just stuff Dr ... and was incredibly excited because he had managed to delete beside Shackleton grave\nIt wasn't until\nWhen he was about four to ... that he does it really talking about ... photo and Shackleton footsteps\nSo by the time or Henry was talking about doing his first expedition he had two children backs and Alicia initially when he decided he wanted to do something that you know how many people say suddenly wait a second I Want to go walk to the south pole [laughter] I'm a you know his kids were a little bit will dirt\nBut a joy and it was very supportive\nOf us well huge believe as in trying to fulfill dreams and most of the time\nFulfilled trains and most of the time my ridge still he's from fulfilling you were an individual dreams\nBecause you've feel you have to get permission from the other person and I felt that through my twenties I had fulfilled a lot of my dreams that had to do so it's fun and he went into the army when he was Eighteen and I felt that it was his town really\nSo for his third trip he wanted to walk across that Dr cook to fulfill the goal that his hero shock then was not able to achieve but he wanted to do with a low\n[noise] they said there was a ... you know we\nTalk all the seventies or on the trial or not I am\nEach day with similar I mean Henry would get up in the early in the morning hike up his lead this usually took about an hour as harness we'll be connected to the planet and you begin to haul the Donald Michael mule\nBarbie skiing for Ninety minutes of it and taking a five minute break\nAnd he would walk with his skis burning as much as eight thousand calories in a day\nOr every craving food ... stole crazy statesmanship small chips like some potato exploit story\nHe would do this particularly in a task and challenge the day after day there was something almost primal about a coalition\nSingular purpose became to just make his mileage he had to achieve so many miles a day if he was the ultimately accomplished his goal\nMiles a day if he was the ultimately accomplished his goal\nNine ... coal fields ... miles today everybody does in some are caused by\nNine points out of the ... hard one to psychology that long ago today just ... miles of the funny\nThing everybody Twenty one point you know ... was a disappointment but it's only you know come all there's all I can do the engine of global all day\nHe would track for fourteen Fifteen sometimes sixteen hours across an alien landscape is covered with a sheet of ice it's possible colossus\nThe wife actually dropping off his ability to see the rise of regional this morning it was a very tough day many pauses or take a breath waiting for my excuse\nTax as drunks seven PM I check my mortgage college during the day and it was eleven and will set them right yeah my church again was twelve festival nine not enough\nTo to him I don't know\nWell he was at that on the satellite than\nHave stand it\nMuch harder than other expeditions and at least if you're with other people and you can take time to be at the front\nWhereas if you delete scare\nCriticized miles [noise]\nHave time to quit playing my God\n\nHe felt the constant strain of making his mileage so that he could reach\nString of making his mileage so that he could reach the end point of the expedition before the end of the month of January because in February begins the winter season and start to cope with the temperature drops even further it can reach a minus a hundred degrees Fahrenheit\nEven Eli shuts down then and at that point there would be no exit\nIf you can show off of you for your time today are gone and so on and there was nothing except the wheel which says to them\n\nYou would have goals recognized as a joke actually\nFeed them more and they still doing well says July ought to use\nI listen to his blogs every day and they were pretty good they were ... feet but uh I was just very concerned that was the highest miles on his and he was older he was fifty five when he says how it's instead of [noise]\nShe could hear him growing more tired [noise]\nThat you wonder what she should do [noise]\nConstantly that he was being [noise] didn't last night I was in a terrible position as to whether to say an right to just ... you know it's going to make and\nJust ... you know going to make you cannot make the end oh say he'll do die [noise] really difficult one [noise]\nMy tennis to say I'm sure we'll be fine\n[noise]\nInterrupted sleep last night a Starbucks\nBy now his entire body within ... is his back frog all his muscles ate he was suffering from the early signs of frostbite especially in his thumb which he struggled to move he has lost more than forty pounds it was so tired\nThat one day during a snack break he fell asleep while sitting on his lead in the middle of a white out\nJust stop stop [noise] risque well it allows you to listen to all these laws that do all day last week\nHe kept a diary a personal diary this when he didn't broadcast when he didn't he wrote legs or stick thin an arms puny\nThroughout you know I mean I was", "show_name": "New Yorker Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "14"}
