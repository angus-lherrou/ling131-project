{"month": "10", "state": "NV", "station": "KUNR", "content": "The candidates were running as extreme as on the right openly white supremacist candidates\nEven neo Nazis Andrew Moran has been covering the movement known as the old right\nAnd he's watching how it influences mainstream politics\nInjure you've been reporting on the fringes of right wing nationalism and all the associated movements people like Mike ... for example who was involved in pizza gate\nAnd you've also written about the Nazi website the Daily Stormer which is built on disturbed Nazi lore we've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacist had been running for office in the United states of America when did this all start what did the origins of it\nIt's never really not exist but in terms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely note that Democrats have engaging that Republicans have engaged in it\nBut it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a whistle you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white\nAll you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was for his campaigning for president he campaigned and give a big speech in the show but county Mississippi and he talked there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why\nBecause he voted for tonight it when people asked him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what do you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he the separately denied it\nThey're not really denying it anymore so people like you know Steve King who is a congressman and Iowa he's not flirting with the line he he doesn't believe that these lines should exist\nSo what does what does Steve king's history what does he said and done\nSo Steve King is a congressman from Iowa he's a represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November\nAnd he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization and European heritage and that kind of stuff but he always in the past would leave some plausible deniability\nAnd then just in the last couple of years partly because of Trump's and partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe um has been saying things like demographics our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies\nThere's no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to mean white people there is no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kinda gets called to the mat and says\nNo I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to eat he doesn't delete them he kinda says oh this you know PC culture everybody gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff but he never\nBut he gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff but he never walked back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one of Stephen King statements about diversity this is from an interview that he gave to in Iowa radio program\nAnd when you START I that's the way the differences then you'll end up with people that are at each other's throats than adding up as panic than black and he predicts will be a greater number than whites that America I operate activists panic then the blacks will be fighting each other before that\n... what do you make of that\nOr I mean there are there are much more extreme examples of his rhetoric than that but basically it's that's kind of a turning the tables have saying by talking about\nAh you know the black voting block or the Hispanic voting bloc\nAnyone doing that is there for the race is Paul Ryan the speaker of the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forget how long he waited but Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says\nWe abhor racism so in other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the GOP can very comfortably washed their hands with him and say he's not our guy he is the guy they're not pulling funding from him at least not in a way that they're making public\nTo what does it suggest about American politics that the most powerful leader and one of the houses of Congress Paul Ryan feel they cannot afford to reject somebody like ...\nIt's terrifying it's yeah it means that they've read the tea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one could call a cyber proud of fascism yeah fortunately talking to a lot of ...\nOne could call a cyber predator fascism and yeah unfortunately talking to a lot of people who are are the very most active players and voices in what you're going to fascism and what does it tell you about American political life\nLook I think it's not that everything has utterly transformed and you know we weren't\nWe weren't close to the brink and now we are I mean we're closer now for sure but um what is the brink well it can't happen here you know that that notion that you know yeah ... fascism could have happened in Europe but it can't happen here I think we're now all starting to see that\nThere is no law of nature that says that the walls of the United states that we we we are extremely flawed\nSociety where the extremely a dicey racial history\nThat I'm perhaps a uniquely so among the countries we're talking about democracy is a very delicate tricky thing right if Steve King is now going out there and just essentially saying to the people of Iowa hello I'm a white nationalist do you want to vote for me or do you want to vote for the other guy\nThere's no guarantee that they want to vote for the other guy well let's talk about the other guy his opponent kings opponent is a Democrat and former baseball player named J. D. shoulder to shoulder to have a chance and what are the dynamics of that race look like\nHe's much taller so that's generally a good thing about sixty six six and he's driving around the district in Winnebago and you know shaking everyone's hand and being very folksy he's out fundraising king\nHe's still down in the polls incumbency is a very powerful thing in house elections and king has been there for six terms what's the district time it's deep deep red as they say and king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at his Twitter feed but racism is not his only thing you know he also\nYou know once ethanol subsidies and he also you know\nThe only thing you know he also you know once ethanol subsidies and he also you know says he wants to support farmers now he's been in Congress for Fifteen Years he has sponsored exactly one bill that passed which was to rename a post office in Iowa so he's not the most effective legislator\nNow that we live in the age of ... are there new politicians on the scene who seem to be entering the stage or coming onto the stage in a way they might not have before\nYeah I think someone like Cory Stewart he was someone who the Virginia a GOP just thought would fizzle out and he's running for Senate he's running for Senate against Tim Kaine who will probably win but you know with this level of support\nHe's doing better than one would expect I mean he\nHe won the primary and his whole national image is based on being standing up for these Confederate monuments we can't turn them down there our heritage he was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota so\nNot the heart of the confederacy are to the confederacy and Steve came by the way it used to have a Confederate flag on his desk in the Capitol building which by the way Iowa sent a lot of soldiers to die to fight against the confederacy so it's like gee I Wonder what that flag means to you\nIn New Jersey and the state of New Jersey or New Jersey congressman Seth gross and was dropped by the Republican Party after saying that diversity is crap is that an outlier incident is that a very rare instance of the of the party standing up to some of its extremist voices\nI think he I think the set Grossman thing was a bit of an anomaly I mean you have even more in most cases than that you have\nA guy named Arthur Jones in Illinois who is literally a Nazi who stands in front of Nazi flags and give speeches and he won a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to run a lot of Republicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the general election\nRepublicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the general election it's very scary that a literal Nazi is is running for office in Illinois and that and that this guy Seth Grossman is running for office in New Jersey but those are outliers I mean so I don't want to paint the picture that you know this is happening everywhere all the time\nBut again the fact that someone like ... New Jersey in New Jersey\nWould have you know concealed his feelings a little bit more\nOf just a few years ago just a couple of years ago but now he's on he's unleashed he's unleashed he's linking to this a blog post you know calling black people inherently dangerous and you know he's just posting this on his website and then he says oh well I'm Jewish so I Can't be racist so\nI'm falls yeah I can falsify that one of ...\nA century ago it was a second flowering of the Ku Klux Klan and there were a coup Klux Klan members in Congress Ku Klux Klan members in every business organization in chamber of commerce in the country\nUm it was like a social movement in some ways Ku Klux Klan barbecues and block parties and all the rest of the somewhat different from the the um first flowering of the Ku Klux Klan but it was the Klan nevertheless\nIs that kind of mass acceptance of white supremacy are organized white supremacy I'm a possibility\nYes I think it is I mean this is I Do think it ebbs and flows and I think it's important to note that\nWhen the year anniversary march happened there was no one there I mean literally like Fifteen people their year anniversary of Charlotte Charlotte so right so that Jason Kessler tried to go to DC in and do it again and no one went with him things do change but I Do think\nIt is possible for this kind of broad based you know\nIt is possible for this kind of broad based you know racism as a as a fun social club\nThing to take off again um you know the Proud Boys are a social club the ... or this group of you know they called themselves the western chauvinists ah they denied being a white pride organization but they're a quote unquote western pride organization and the Proud Boys just this past\nAnd when you go see 'em a second time on January twenty seven yeah he asked me to come back ... was that different are the same or what it was it was a little\nDifferent in the sense that um he was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I you know testified before this sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice if one White House official live to another\nAnd and what did you make of that [noise] um well I tried to explain\nTo him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official lying to another which\nGod that would help he would be concerned about anyway but then it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having these discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this was a problem\nAnd we also thought you know the vice President Pence\nWas entitled to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood in you know in front of of the public\nThat that was a trip so we were trying to help them\nSo your second meeting with Don McGahn is January twenty seventh also on January twenty seventh I'm an executive order is issued yeah um\nBanning travel from seven Muslim majority countries did you know anything about that until it was issued\nNow and and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there\nAnd that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him at length\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order as you said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending this\nSo how did you find out about the travel there um I was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport\nAnd get a call I was able to keep one aide with me want us to my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and so ... calls me and he says after you left you know I went online I was reading the New York times\nAnd it looks like President Trump has issued some sort of travel ban\nWe spent the weekend\nI'm trying to get our arms around and communicating with the White House um what is it that you're trying to do and\nBy Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a position on the constitutionality of the travel ban the next morning and in a case so we convened everybody in my conference room and it's been a very long time in there I'm Talking through what the challenges were\nWhat the White House position was in terms of the scope of the travel ban we talked about the different challenges constitutionally and statutory early and otherwise that have been filed [noise]\nUm and at the end of that conversation\nI was not satisfied that it was lawful or constitutional and what troubles me beyond that\nTo ... what troubles me beyond that was that it became clear that\nTo defend the constitutionality of this I was going to have to send department of justice lawyers and to take the position that this travel ban that applied just a Muslim majority countries had absolutely nothing to do with religion\nAnd this was in the face of all of the president's statements that he had made both on the campaign trail and after he had been elected and\nThat did not seem like the truth to me\nBut isn't it usually been job of a department of justice to defend actions of the administration even if you personally would not have ... you know issued that order or ... years the president's ... the executive branch's lawyers writer why wasn't that good enough for you to say I'm going to defend this\nWell it wasn't just that I disagreed with this on a policy grant and perhaps the appropriate thing then to do would be to resign if you can't be part of that um but not directed apart but not to defend it but here's what's different is that\nI happen to believe ... should go into court and make an argument that's not grounded in truth but the department of justice [noise]\nI mean [noise] if the\nO. J. stands for anything it's supposed to stand for what is true and what is just [noise] so what did you do [noise] I knew that I personally couldn't be parked a defending this an argument something that\nParked I'm defending this an argument something that that wasn't granted in ... um but you know I thought about what may be the thing to do was reside\nAnd that would have protected my personal integrity I wouldn't have been part of this um but I was like just the head of the civil division or you know some other component of the department [noise]\nI was the acting attorney general of the United states and I felt like I had a responsibility to protect not just my personal integrity but the integrity of the department of justice as well and I thought back to my confirmation hearing\nWhen I'm there were some senators including Senator Sessions who they were all over me and my confirmation hearing about\nWhat I Would do if the president asked me to do something that with unlawful are wrong and I think Senator Sessions said you know even if it's just something that would bring disrupt ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and will you saying that you know none of them were asking\nMe will you resign they were asking me will you say no and they were right about that it wasn't my responsibility in that position I think to resign I think it was my responsibility to sign up so how did you say no they\nI mean it wasn't like a state public statement it was just a communication\nAnd we both we had there were communications going on at levels below me and between me and Mr McGahn and I should the directive to the department and then what happens [noise] um I was fired ... you were fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable [laughter] but\nYou were fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable [laughter] hired by Donald Trump did that surprise you are or ... how did you think the story was going to end once you said you weren't going to allow the travel ban to defend it\nLook I certainly recognized there was a very real possibility for like probability that I Would be fired in this in this context but I hoped\nThat maybe there was a chance that by doing this that would cause them to step back and take a breath and look at what they were doing and more\n... okay I Know everybody's got a impolite so loud [laughter] seems kinda silly now doesn't it um but you know I did\nHarbor this hope that maybe they would step back they would have the kind of process they would get the kind of input I'm there would be real discussion about this um I had spent twenty seven years at the department of justice I loved that place\nUm I did not want to have the period on my service they're being fired\nWhat what's your assessment of the whole series of events\n[noise] um I suppose you could say that the president and made a campaign promise and he was making good on that promise but beyond the fact that I Believe that particularly the first one was a lawful unconstitutional I think it's\nAbsolutely the antithesis of who we are as a country and [noise]\n[noise] and [noise]\nSally a long time Justice Department official who was the acting attorney general at the start of the Trump Administration Sally ate spoke with Jeffrey ... at the New Yorker [noise]\n\nNow I'm as you mentioned the travel ban was revised one ... was revised twice the courts have struck down each of the versions including the third and final version until it went to the Supreme Court\nWhich upheld at five to four ... what's your view of the travel ban in its final form and the Supreme Court's decision about it\nYou know I haven't studied travel ban three the same way that I did the first one that you know I I still despite the other ... you know taking out the preference for Christians\nUm and throwing in a couple of non Muslim majority countries despite the fact that you know they made some changes you know I Am still troubled by\nUm the animal is that I Believe infected the first as well as the travel ban ... and\nHad this paradoxical situation since Jeff Sessions has been attorney general where he has been in the policy areas you talk about very much advancing the Trump agenda\nAt the same time the president has been just beating the hell out of him in public ... what do you make of that I mean ... what what\n[laughter] what are you\nWhat [laughter] what are you making that what's up with that at one time [laughter] thank you [laughter]\nYou know I mean I think he clearly has been trying to humiliate him into resigning I mean that you know that's been going on for so long now and what doesn't even make the news anymore\n\nThere are ways you can tailor your will or trust to have a lasting impact on valued community organizations like hey you went on just put them helpful information about estate planning K.

her musing an points to someone who really understand and appreciate the sources of her own music and also kind of implicates where that music might go in the future\nSo we talked and then she also gave an incredible live performance along with one of our producers in the region\n\nThank you so much for being here with us for the Nineteen New Yorker festival and for the top [noise]\nFirst of all I have immense respect for any singer performer anybody who goes with just the first name as ... as far as I'm concerned [laughter] can you tell us how did you decide you know how you wanted to present yourself about\nWell I was really committed to the full name calling it on ... and stuff I I really wanted to be known first and last mhm and everybody was like ... and ... and you're going to run into issues on people try to search your name basically\nVery strong from the thank God but um yeah I Know you grew up in the DC area and then there was a sort of\nStrong from this article as long as I Know you grow up in the DC area there was a thriving culture music or the things you are listening to agree we're starting to perform and um to to start writing songs about all those will just come and go over\nUm you know it's it's really weird because you know I feel like I'm grown up in a really ... it's\nAn intersection only experience you know there's a lot of things going on at the same time you know I'm a I'm a daughter of immigrants of African immigrants is African immigrants particularly if he opens and then there's the lair of\nGrowing up in a suburb of DC I'm\nI'm being bussed from a you know ghetto suburb [laughter]\nTo a wider suburb and what that means you know um there's a particular way that you're processing the world when your school is extremely segregated I Would say that's the case for everybody but you know there's a way it was happening in my school\nSo I was listening to a lot of different things you know I was obsessed with with armed be any armed evil was just down his like zero us home base\nAnd I would say before that I was listening to jazz and in world music and just you know a lot of traditional music and then\nI remember my ex boyfriend my first boyfriend had a Napster membership one of the first of all while\nWe were all and I got no really divorce you know [laughter] I kept\nThat membership for a few years to survey every\nFemale focused\nThis survey every female\nVocal period I was just on a mission to just scan the world for every single type of thing and\nYeah and so I just would learn music and other languages but mainly jazz\nYou know that was the thing that I was sort of serving the most and um so you know I've had different periods where I was just\nImmersed in one sound um and then after that it was sort of a really experimental music you know so electronic and experimental music\nWhen I think about my experimental electronic music side a lot of those references are still black because I'm thinking about Jimmy Jam and Terry list or I'm thinking about both the comments or you know I'm just\nIn a non famous or Herbie herpes\nWhat was it about armed beer made it sort of the U.S when we're kinda more to dress for some ... some pool on you know I'm\nI guess it was just pop music that was you know like there's a way that you know you can't there's there's no come around every around um jazz when you get to your elementary school\n[laughter] for job for him now where you want to be room is no you don't get to kindergarten and people like you know ... you know\nLike that so I'm yeah I think that is just the pool it's the thing that happens to every him is small human being the when they see Michael Jackson for the first time or when they see 'em you know when they hear Mariah\nUm you know when they hear Mariah\nAny of those sort of bank huge artists won't have that pool you know um but you know my love for jazz never never died [noise]\nCan it can keep my no\n... in the\n[noise] still get\nThen the\n\n\n\nAnd jazz is part of what you're supposed to do is reinterpret the standard you know that's how you get good so for me I always just been interested in how those things could be ...\nOh it's just been interested in how those things could be flipped\nAnd be presented to you I'm so that you you like it in a different way I'm yeah\nSpeaking of reinterpreted as soon as they are like a song you have a song you want to sing and he's going to get my money's going to be wrong but you look ... salt on it and you were\nThat Coelho sauce [noise] um\nThere's there's yeah there I mean there are some songs there is a phone call Thirty years by buddy Carter some favorite songs in the world um\nThere's there's a few jazz songs are just like waiting for the prompt you know waiting for the for the appropriate context for um yeah there's a whole I think organic instruments\nSide to what I Do\nHow do you sort of manage the business of ... there's this sort of our book but you into the room and there's also this look look the entity though did you how do you write taco between those two\nIt has taken 'em a lot of intention to a rally people around who\nI actually am and not a projection of what they would likely to be you know um\nThat is I think a struggle for for any artists out there but uh there's a particular way that um as a black woman I'm being asked\nTo present
