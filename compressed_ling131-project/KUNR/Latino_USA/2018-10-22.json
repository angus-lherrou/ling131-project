she might think\n[noise] but even though she might seem perky or carefree ... is also highly accomplished and focused\nRight now she's on a mission to flip the Texas Governor see blue for the first time in nearly Thirty years\nIf she does she'll be the first openly gay and let the governor of the state of Texas that is if she can get let me know voters to turn out for her and that's the hard

stuff in in ah usually I put on some yucky closed for it\nI put on some yucky closed for and then change into other close but I have no idea what the schedule is like today's so just dress to be ready to whatever\nBut it was a little surprising to find that in a predominantly let me know city like Odessa that the people who came out to support her are the longtime older white Democrat\nNot the first time Latino voters she needs to turn out if she wants to win [noise] and at her next campaign event this problem seems to get worse [noise] that's coming up stay with us [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThis

were with her on the campaign trail\nAnd after stopping in Odessa we drove about an hour northeast to Howard College in big spring Texas and other majority Latino city\nWe walk into a they're conditioned room at the college and we wait for the Howard county Democrats to announce that sure ... is there get\nArmy but after listing off her credentials the sheriff isn't really paying attention instead she leans over to us and points to a guy in the corner with a camera\nIn the corner with a camera to doing great friend\nThat's my truck right now to me like Greg Abbott and raise to trust me everywhere I go to take my first people started to wonder mounted on us with the cuts just much more than we were Democrats these\nHigh suddenly she's called up to the stage she's caught a little bit off guard as she adds up to the podium and we're watching her walk up and then we kind of get a chance to look\nAt who is in the room right so if up until this point it seems like Lupe at all does is the candidate who has what it takes to deliver Texas to the Democrats\nThe candidate who is of the people and for the people law enforcement algae teach you peel the working class well this is where that notion it's a bump in the road\nThere's about thirty five people in the room we're in and we noticed that potentially devastating campaign for young people specifically lack there of\nCourse I'm I'm\nReally sure we're trying to get\n'em out this is Rina she's made all the Howard county democratic chair and looking around the room there are no young people here at all and we are at a college there are students everywhere it's who is in session\nThere's actually a room full of college students next door to us in the cafeteria eating lunch\nI don't think they're going to turn out as much as the older individuals I mean I think that's kind of our problem is how do we get them to turn it\nI mean I think that's kind of our problem is how do we get them to turn now\nAnd I'm really not sure what the answer is Erwin ... [noise]\nAnd we're not the only ones who noticed this September Quinnipiac poll has shared held as his favorability rating among young people ten points lower and governor addicts\nYounger voters are important for Democrats to win in any state and one third of eligible Latino voters in Texas are ages Eighteen to twenty nine that's a large portion of Latino voters in a state where the Latino vote\nThese heat [noise]\nBut here we are at a college where nearly half of the students are Latinos and letting us and none of them are at this event\nSo there are a few things that could be contributing to it seems to be a lack of enthusiasm for about it is particularly from young voters the first problem to share of has his name recognition not enough people know who she is\nAnd part of this is advertising and that comes down to money which the sheriff has a lot less of than her opponent governor Abbott has raised over sixty five million dollars in campaign funds compared to the share it's less than half a million\nBut there's something else at play here something that goes deeper into ... as a candidate\n\nThe Democratic primary jolt Texas a political mobilization group for young Latino\nDidn't endorse the sheriff endorsed her rival Andrew white they said it was because of her record\nTo rival Andrew white they said it was because of her record as sheriff of Dallas [noise] they pointed out that during her tenure sheriff cell does cooperated with federal immigration authorities by holding immigrants in her jail cells when requested and handing them over to ice\nWe spoke with ... at a young or from jolt about his concerns and he said he was disappointed when the sheriff didn't have a good answer about this at a forum aimed at young Latino voters in April\nI don't want to hear accountability for her record hurting here like\nThe New York times reported that one of the students who was in the audience to dance a forum said quote you were a Latino when you were helping deport people so why should I trust you now [noise]\nDeserve told us she didn't have a choice she was required by law to cooperate with ice and in fairness she did famously go head to head with Governor Abbott and twenty Fifteen she was refusing to honor ice requests to hold people who were accused of minor offenses\nSince Andrew white lost the Democratic primary jolt is now endorsing her for governor but ... says oh\nWe actually got tax I documented\nI asked ... whether she will take on what some of the younger progress is want her to do to protect undocumented immigrants things like fighting to shut down detention centers and to stop deportations\nSame wired to go to that place but I don't have that power this is a federal issue that the governor\n... that the governor or when you\nKnow I wouldn't just make a statement I take action action can be taken in this before it's before is cruel bill and is affecting the documents that is something I can do\nWhat she's talking about is the ban in Texas on so called sanctuary cities it's a law called as before and it was signed by governor Abbott last\nYear a Governor Greg Abbott\nHe broadcast the moment in a Facebook Live video as our son in law\nThat will band sanctuary cities in the law essentially forces look police to work with federal immigration officials and it allows police to ask people they stop for their papers it ensures that law enforcement officers in Texas can and will cooperate with aren't\nSure if I did opposes the law and has made it one of the biggest issues of her campaign she also supports allowing undocumented immigrants to pay in state tuition\nBut then we ask her about another policy that many on progressive are pushing for\nIs abolish ice part is if\nI used to be reform\nAnd I've seen about the original task advice was to keep people out who do harm they've got away from them\nAnd it needs to be reform but do you honestly want nobody to make sure\nThat another attack on a major city is is not going to happen do honestly just want him to let him come in and and do an attack on the city's sounds a little republic and what you're saying I Know it doesn't it sounds\nRepublican what you're saying I Know it doesn't it sounds like we want to protect our country\nIn\nAnd so maybe some Republicans might like strong borders national security rhetoric maybe she can make up for the lack of enthusiasm offend young Democrats by winning over some Republicans but that's not going to be so easy given how polarized the parties are these days\nAnd so he took that which is not that big of a when I went to farmers branch and went to a couple of other places and said look what I did for valley park I can do that for you too and then he used that when\nTo create confidence in these towns or at least the appearance of confidence\nAnd use that to sort of plow forward so we know for example that he went to farmers branch Texas and said\nI did this in valley park let's keep going there was internal disagreement within the city council about whether they should keep going whether it was worth the money and he said no I can do the same thing for you as I did for valley park and so they press forward ended up spending more than nine million dollars and they are law was entirely struck down\nLike we're not talking about towns the size of Dallas or the size of New York city it's not like they spent nine million dollars and they were like oh wow like they spent nine million dollars and that meant that they couldn't move forward with road construction and so this was actually a material sacrifice\nOn the part of these towns the only person who appears to have a really benefited from this is Kris Kobach so if you think now about you know that strategy ... earlier\nYou know that strategy earlier to what's happening in the United states right now I'm you know what is what is the larger narrative that you see that's at play here in this moment in the United states when we have Donald Trump and the White House\nAnd directing a kind of particular perspective on policies regarding immigration you know I\nI think that prior to Trump getting elected and prior to Trump\nBeing it's hard line on immigration has he has been it was really easy to dismiss people like Kris Kobach but now now does elements of the Republican Party are leading the country and he has a much more impactful voice than he otherwise what\nI think that we can learn from what he has told us he believes in\n[noise]\nI think that it is a sign that radical elements of our country have sort of taken a much larger role and we can no longer just missed [noise]\n\nJust because they do so much for all of your reporting in for joining us on the usa thanks so much ... she had like [noise]\n\nJessica who's meant is a journalist at ProPublica who covers national politics and civil rights we did reach out to the ... campaign\nFor comment on the allegations ended up Republican investigation up we didn't hear back Kobach told ProPublica quote I Believe in the cities and these ordinances and what they're doing and so if there was some way I could help them I think [noise]\nComing up on Latino us\n[noise]\nComing up on Latino USA we talked to the creators of the new HBO documentary the sentence\n[noise] ...

was just an ear is not I mean it woke me up out of a does sleep suddenly jumped up\nAnd later she told me she knew she knew the minute she her the during a visit who'd been knocking on doors you know six thirty quarter to seven in the morning and stuff like seven o'clock quite remember exactly [noise] and she didn't say a word she got to grab the good of the girls you know and and went in a room and this was holding them\nCindy is a Mexican American mother of three and she was being arrested for the crimes of her ex boyfriend a drug dealer even though he's been dead for six years the police charged Cindy\nFor having lived in the same house as her ex boyfriend when he broke the law she received a Fifteen year mandatory sentence for conspiracy [noise]\n[noise]\nI mean I have a child\nYou're going to charge higher\nThan any of that credit\nIn\nCindy story isn't unique it's part of something called the girlfriend problem it's a side effect of the sentencing laws were women end up serving time for the drug crimes of their significant others even though they had\nTime for the drug crimes of their significant others even though they had little to do with those crimes [noise] filmmaker Rudy bud is turned his sister's Cindy's experience in prison into a documentary film called the sentence just premiered on HBO\nAnd the film looks at the impact of Cindy's time in prison on her and her family and also her fight for early release\nI'm joined now by both Cindy and her brother Rudy to talk about the film and life during an after incarceration [noise] so Cindy what was your reaction at the very beginning so you just get sentenced to Fifteen Years and your brother's like\nHey I'm can we make a documentary about this I mean did you kind of want to kill them at that point ...\n... it wasn't a documentary and when he started to film a initially it was just he was taking videos of the girls for me so when I came home I could one day watch them run and play and you know the little girls because I was missing all those things\nAnd so it wasn't until a few years later that he was like hey you know I think this could be a documentary I really want to tell your story and by then I had already met you know so many women whose story was just like mine and\nI understood that nobody knew it was really going on and I wanted to share the story I wanted I thought it was very important I still think it's so important that was a devastating thing to happen to our family you know not just to me it happened to my mom my dad you know my daughter's\nIt was hard for them you know throughout this whole process so it was an easy decision to say yes brother share a story like it was almost my way of you know ...\nShare a story like it was almost my way of you know screaming to the world what was happening there a lot\nOf things in this country that are filled with shame that we don't talk about one of those issues is incarceration and I really do appreciate the fact that this is something that most people would never want to reveal you your whole family was like ruining take this public\nI think she was a great word to bring up here because one of the layers in one of the overall themes that I wanted to bring about in this film\nWas shame and changing the stigma of a being incarcerated individual in what that meant and also being with family have incarcerated individual in what that meant and freely letting people look at what the true ramifications we're so that we could possibly\nPut a little bit of that shame on the system\nSo Cindy there's a point in the film early in your sentence [noise] where you're talking to your then husband and you basically say like look I'm trying to hold it together here I'm not telling you how bad it is 'cause I don't want you guys to know [noise] [laughter]\nWhat is it to be a woman in a prison what didn't you want to tell that you can tell them out\nI mean there's a lot of things there's we can go on and on I mean I never felt safe I mean they were mostly well they were all male guards\nThere were always people who were needing a lot of mental health it it was a very heightened emotional place to be so you couldn't say something to somebody without wandering\nYou couldn't say something to somebody without wondering how they were going to react they weren't bad people but they were put in bad situations and motions ran high\nI mean and I'm I'm figuring that there are some things that I'm seeing these insane\nRight about now you write like she kept a lot of that from us throughout the incarceration and you know a lot of people will credit the family for me so strong and sticking by her throughout this entire process but you know in so many ways Cindy was the strongest person",
