yeah it's like a whole thing I don't get it either but like this has seven hundred thousand views and it's just like this dude\nTo outline and like driving a forklift around and trying to pick stuff up and like put other places yeah but when I think it's funny too and I want to show us like if you look at the comments\nSome people are like giving tip so like I drive a forklift and they don't go super fast but it feels like they do when you're in close quarters and warehouses maybe thirty five to forty miles per hour someone else's like keep your forks low to the ground when traveling like under six inches high prevents loads from tumbling off the forks I'm a forklift driver\nGot all these people commenting like actually drive forklifts and far less and the reason I ended up watching this weird Youtube video is that I've been spending a lotta time doing research on the future of jobs and the economy and in fact I found out that a lot of our future jobs involve forklifts and that's because one of the\nFastest growing industries in our country today in the industry of moving and storing stuff especially stuff that we order on line\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWe're going to start our show by diving into one of the fastest growing part of the American economy it's warehouses it\nOf the American economy it's warehouses it\nWe're the party in between space that all of this stuff from cat food to fuzzy socks flows through on the way to us and the industry is exploding\nTwenty third team then President Obama visited an Amazon warehouse in Chattanooga, Tennessee

manufacturing jobs but he was also there in Chattanooga to highlight job growth in other sectors Amazon had just announced that it was hiring thousands of workers for its warehouses nationwide\nNow over the next two years experts are saying that the warehousing industry needs to hire over four hundred thousand workers just to keep up with the growth and e commerce so the jobs of tomorrow are actually warehouse work\nAnd many of those jobs will be held by Latinos and let the nuts currently in about forty percent of Eighteen to thirty four year olds working in the where housing business are

from working in warehouses\nNo our producers of your buddies that car is taking a tour real warehouse where these young people might work one day\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIf you remember Patterson, California has all of these warehouses over by the highway and it's a perfect place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco\nOne of those warehouses if Amazon\nI reach out to them to see if I could come take a look around and\nAnd visiting the facility gave me a sense of what the future of warehousing well actually look like at the commerce gross especially when it comes to increased automation [noise]\nAs I entered the building bears just this wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling kind that you see in the New York city subway\nAnd there are signs everywhere at say no photos\nOnce a guard left me and I realize it's springtime tons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners\nUnder our feet [noise]\nAh we play more than ...\nUh we also him way more than a hundred full time\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to forget who introduced herself as a community specialist I'm not sure what that means in fact there is a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associate\nEntry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase so stealing our customer promise workers were\nWalking around there or stop signs in a lot of places and lines on the ground like wrote\nWhich is good because I'm\nWe will see another one in a minute we called them ADD ATVs\nBasically it's like a forklift loaded up with items but it's totally unmanned and it follows a map of the warehouse floor programmed into it\nEverything in this warehouse is yellow and gray except for another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange\nWhen you think of robots this isn't always but people have in mind this is Lauren\nLynch who does communications for Amazon [noise] they're\nPerson shaped robots more like big orange room because they're square and on top of each of them is a set of shelves which holds items\nOperate in this\nSo this is how it works so somebody really wants to order a back massager they click it on line once they do that that's when the ice\nOrder a back massager they click it on line once they do that that's one of the item gets ...\nYou're a notice on the screen\nProvided the item\nAnd then a quantity and how many they need\nTo pick back massager a second worker calls the orange robots over retrieved massager from shelf and then puts it on the yellow ...\nKind of like those airport security trace which go on a conveyor belt set and I stopped in the process\nThat we're going to go and so\nAt the population is what it sounds like basically the back massager comes in on the yellow tray and the worker packed into box no robots here this is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy ... so what do you have\nMachine\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo stuff she's seen someone order\nI ask her how many items does she have to pack a day\nWell I Know in our they want us to do about as Greece so\nSomebody would do an hour here and so you can do that we worked ... hours a day\nNormally do for the week so if you do the math actually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty item a week\nSo the very last thing that happens to your back massager is that it gets a shipping lately all of the labor at this point is done by a magical puff of air\nBy a magical puff of air\nLabel is created and generally play into the air on top of all\nThat sound you hear\nOn the air that is a thing it ought to be this hard I have to admit it's literally my favorite [noise]\n\nSo the robots Amazon pretty amazing and on the way and I pass signs of a mother's room and there are vending machines that I see two\nThey're free to workers with items like ear plugs lotion Advil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly\nWage to Fifteen dollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands of Amazon employees are on food stamps and ... are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time\nAnd a book published this year by a reporter who worked undercover at an Amazon facility in the u._k. details that workers often wouldn't even take bathroom breaks because they feared not making work quota and that workers were actually penalized for taking six days\nAnd responded that they didn't recognize these allegations that's accurate they also said they coach people who aren't making the quotas and that their attendance policy has changed these kinds of conditions are part of why employee turnover at Amazon is a very high while I'm Amazon I asked learn about the\nWe don't have power over light individuals make the decisions they make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time\nThey make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time they choose to but we are able to do is provide a great work place with great team members and great benefits\nA consequence of so many workers turning in and out of warehouses is that it's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no unionized Amazon warehouses in the United states\nAmazon primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with associates\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talk to their managers that they have a problem than work with a union to voice concern\n[noise] [noise]\nSo without strong worker protections and in an ever shifting workforce are these the jobs that the graduates of Patterson high school really want I head down to Los Angeles to place reckoning with these questions [noise]\n\nThe warehouse workers resource center is located in Long Beach on one side of the room is a wall of photos of workers protesting on the other side\nIs one of the only organizations in the country that advocates for warehouse\nWorkers the train people on things like wage theft and how to file for workers' comp for injuries at the warehouse enter the day I visit is Duane wealth and he's twenty five and he drove forklifts for local warehouses\nAlike working in a way as it is now ... you know your muscles as a child going into\nTweens been working in warehouses and the last seven years after he dropped out of college to start helping his family his mom got sick and he helped out paying rent and bills the biggest problem for him\nHealth out paying rent and bills the biggest problem for him though is the lack of consistent hours the Wayne doesn't work directly for the warehouse he worked for a temp agency and the agency is supposed to have him working at the warehouse forty hours a week but\nSometimes they don't want them to do was we wouldn't be on the so\nTwain sometimes lines up at five AM in the morning first shift at six AM after being called in and still get turned away sometimes the only one full week a month doing shows me his phone\nHe gives me voted the sniffles or\nOkay so it had senior manager and the work tomorrow he says not tomorrow they can I at least we're friday like can you give me anyways is necessarily Thursday night of the things that other than you taxes I worked in a while you\nKnow but that is a constant threat of that basically yeah\nAnd after moving up and getting off the temp hamster wheel green says he's never even seen a way to apply directly for a full time job at the warehouse that he works at\nBasically warehousing companies use temp agencies because it's cheaper\nTemp agencies provide a steady stream of labor to warehouses that don't have to worry about recruiting workers or managing them they take money out of each worker's hourly wage and joins us as a temp agency doesn't tell them how much it could be a dollar ten dollars they don't know and a lot of work or a steady paycheck makes workers less likely to speak up\nBecause they don't want to risk sacrificing the hours they do have\n... case he says he'd like to go back to school maybe become a writer but that's not his plan right now\nThe kind of loose going to school\nThat's not his plan right now\nI kind of ... going to school like the things that they as do I wish I didn't complain about 'cause it doesn't seem so ... so difficult anymore [noise]\nNo it's not it's not about being confrontational it's about seeking connection it's about allowing elected officials to remember who they represent to connect their humanity to your humidity\nWhen\nI was asking myself that question of whether I Want it to tell my story or not and in that moment I just went with it\nAnd he said you know I I was five he was Fifteen\nAnd I shared at that time when I was five with two adults not my parents who either didn't believe me or didn't know what to do that information they never did anything so then I just understood the lesson that\nWe are not believed and these boy he understood the lesson that boys will be boys and I don't want my children to learn that lesson\n\nI Want to believe that in our country we actually listened to survivors\nAnd it was a very painful moment I cried after because I realized\nOh my God maybe my father will hear it this way for me and my mother who hear this way [noise] and then [noise] it didn't reach them but then on friday I texted me that right after\nInteraction with lake and they said you might hear something and then use I Want you to know that I Am okay and he said\nTo know that I Am okay and he said I'm\nSorry I was not able to protect you and I said to him it was not your fault that it's not my fault and they feel very supported by you but you know that fear was confirmed I didn't tell them my story because I didn't want him and other people who love me to\nHave to hold that pain\nAnd I'm not doing it alone like I'm doing it with all these women and I feel so much in community with thousands of women I have never met but whose stories I deeply deeply understand\nWhen you see what happened in the moment with Senator Flake how do you connect that to the kind of activism that you've been doing and developing on immigration how did those two worlds come together in that moment for you\nA lot of the conversation about a survivors has centered or the stories of women kind of without talking about the rest of their experience of who we are I Can't separate\nMe being a woman from being led the now from being an immigrant from being a mother\nAnd now accepting and embracing these other part of my identity as a survivor I think the history of these countries a history of the struggle for inclusion\nOf more of us and the promise of freedom\nIn some ways the the act of bird dog named Senator Flake people will say it is your most overt political act in some deeply
