table just a couple of Congress and\nThe sound of a new female making ethical [noise]\nI've been positive in that ... the next people mhm because of our own kind of history in this country that we're going to be bringing a different kind of politics yeah right and I'm just wondering where like you know what you think about um that notion\nTo be\nThe next or to be like the na our identity is the most I Will say is the most intersection identity in the world so for example\nFor sexual identity and the world's so for example I'm Puerto Rican that means that I Know that I Am African\nI Am indigenous I Am also the product of European colonization\nI feel like to be like the ... and to fully acknowledge your identity and everything that goes into your identity means that we have to champion the causes of everybody in order to champion the causes of ourselves and so\nWhen you look at an issue like immigration for example\nThese aren't just quote unquote Mexicans coming in from the border these are these are indigenous people\nAnd this is their land\nWhere your mom and dad speaking to you in St Luke's on the Anita ... he was proud like being a war was a message like look on Sunday that you're in New York or through and through however you want to define yourself\nKnow I was\nI grew up with a very strong sense of patriotism\nA very strong sense as we are American I also was raised as you are ... like through and through and so I grew up like\nThe music I grew up around was Hector level sell the ACLU's and then hip hop in you know growing up around the brand your favorite hip hop artist would be so hard I grew up around like public enemy\nI grew up around like public enemy and not as Jay Z and then of course you have like this late nineties boom of I like yeah fat job do you have big pond\nYou have all these people that we grew up around as well and so\nIt's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes people say like oh wow you're the way you articulate your platform is do interest action all and to me it's not even that we're trying it's\nThis is who we are and so what what it means to be American and what we grew up and like how we grew up around these values was my dad\nWe'd go visit family and what do they go every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really yeah do you mean like for the weekend well I mean we would take a little family vacation and it'll be like ... and you were young yeah those are like a two places where he went on family ... she cried\n[laughter] it was colonial Williamsburg I'm for three going not as bad [laughter]\nHow do you manage that as being a young enough you know a lot of people don't know if they you know it's not like you're walking around member of Congress dreamy with you know rice um and at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress\nI'm Still processing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous or just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been at the process but I had a friend come over a couple of months ago and there was a ...\nTo go and there was a magazine that had my face on the cover of it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of or political ideas of twenty teens\nAnd she looked at it and we were laughing at it because it doesn't feel like this isn't my ... this is an island but we're laughing at it\nAnd she says that's what you are you're an idea now and I felt like I had to be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nSo that maybe this through an interesting question are you managing your ego\n'cause I mean the truth is is that you're getting all kinds of call backs right and what is the kind of mind games but it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and all of that but at the same time it's also lonely\n[noise] it is and if anything the there are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary [noise]\nIn my brain and in my heart I feel very grateful and I feel very humbled but a lot of the six dreams of terrifying I feel like I have this huge target because I'm embodying\nSome of the most vulnerable people in society\nThe issues that I'm Talking about or not read versus blue\nThey're just not their top versus bottom and so\nFor me\nI still struggle with even conceiving\nI still struggle with even conceiving the idea of getting a call back like sometimes I talk to our team and I'm like do you think so and so would respond to us now like yeah of course and I'm like will they or I so worried about people showing up to my advantage\nThere was an article I think it was in the New Yorker where they made a point of where you know that when you talk to kids you come down to their level mhm and I was thinking about that also in terms of the way you you say you know you talk to people you approach them you come in you touched them you'll be in your yeah are you thinking about it more as like well this is a really affect their political tactics\nFeel like I learned it from my parents and when I reflect on my life experience I think of my my parents were funnily enough my parents were never political\nYou know my family would always come over and we would talk politics around the kitchen table but my parents never organized or did anything like that but\nWhen I think about my experience I think of my parents have natural organizers they were so good at building community\nI went to public school about thirty minutes north in a small town in West Chester but I didn't live that kind of class experience because in any affluent area there is an underclass of people who serve the people who live there and that's what my family was my mom clean the houses\nOf the kinds of people that I went to school and\nAnd my dad really struggled to start his own small business\nDad really struggled to start his own small business\nTo help support our family but it was always struggling growing up and it was really just picking up you know towards towards actually be end of his life and so my mom would invite the cashiers from the local Dunkin' Donuts over to the house\n... ... talk because those are the people that are family could relate to they were always about leaning in to people and the politics come second and that's how I practice as well\nEven though I feel very strongly about my beliefs my number one job is to care about people and to lean into them show them that they are cared for\nAnd make them feel hurt because I Am hearing them\nWe talk about the politics\nWhat is your puppy same to you when you're hearing your dad no\nMan I think uh [noise]\nIt's like I'm so motion although [noise]\nI'm Sorry no was already to threaten oh my gosh [noise] so it's okay what is the prime tell me what your um just 'cause like [noise]\nNo one's asked me that question [noise]\nWeird because like I guess I'm not\nI'm processing this has you're asking me but it's like um\nIt's like having someone walking with you the whole time and it's somewhat and then like you're going months and months and months and no one technology\nYou're going months and months and months and no one's acknowledging the person next to you and then it's like oh what does this I think so it's it's a little emotional but um [noise]\n\nThe last thing my dad ever told me before he passed away [noise]\nWas make me proud\nAnd for a really really really long time\nI felt like I felt\nLike I had failed my parents because of the situation we're in my dad had passed away my mom was back to cleaning houses I was tending bar and waiting tables and I felt like [noise]\nYoung women of color could see themselves and they could understand that it's okay\nTo be depressed that it's something that\nIs normal um also that it's okay to be flawed you know because we don't really see characters like that very much [noise]\nI I think we're expected to be like I like the title says we're expect to be perfect both in\nSociety and within her family is and that's just not realistic at all and so I just want them to know that\nI Know that they exist\nIt's okay it's okay to be who they are [noise]\n\n\nThank you for putting it into words Erica centers

dot org\nWelcome back to Latino USA I'm ...\nSo a few months ago we brought you a story about how young Latinos are navigating higher education and we looked at how one university Oregon State is trying to combat the troubling trend of Latinos not finishing college\nAnd a couple of weeks ago we looked at the future of warehouse jobs many of which are filled by young Latinos and let the nuts and we wondered whether or not these jobs offer a path to the middle class\nThese stories were part of a partnership with the community service society of New York\nA nonprofit that among other things conducts demographic research to help in their mission of fighting poverty in New York City their data helped bring you these stories and today I'm sitting down with lives are Christian he's the organizations\nDirector of youth policy to talk about some of that data that they've gathered about Latinos and education in New York City over the last year\n\nSo I think lives are when I first\nSo I think lives are when I first met you you were like proudly the geek you were like look I Love data\nI Love numbers the whole world makes sense to me because of data numbers and there are a lot of you out there in the world [laughter] absolutely\nI think we live in times where what people are talking about can be a little bit uncertain and I find comfort in basing some of the things I talk about on real facts and figures\nOkay so every person who loves data has a story behind it you like this really wonderful story about what inspired you to do this kind of research and data so what's the ...\nThe particular line of work that we're talking about stems from one day I went with my parents I'm guessing was about ten years ago to see the terrific show in heights\nLike Washington Heights ... the ... day you wake up and I got this little plug\nBecause I actually grew up in Washington Heights where the show was about and it's a Broadway musical by minimum or handling\nJot gene so\nYou know it's a terrific show and displayed in all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights\nMexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to salsa\nWhereas my experience to having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community and actually never heard sauce until I went to college so I started thinking about law I thought it was really great that the show put the communities on the map\nGreat that the show put the communities on the map there the diversity within the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself I wondered if it wasn't getting out that actually the the different communities within Latino Americans and was going to New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the date a little bit\nTo see well if I were to tell a slightly different story that there are\nReal differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the new policy field that I work and\nSo what did you find what surprised\nYou well working in New York City schools and in your policy field\nSo much of your policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners and the first thing that jumped out at me was that you've got three really distinct communities that Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and\nThe largest one Puerto Rican New Yorkers really have no English language learner issues over Ninety percent\nOf young people of Puerto Rican origin in New York speak English as their main are are are best language and are born in New York City so I started to think well\nIf the policy field is sort of lumping all Latinos together around this one issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences and the communities both ways to make them great and then ways that we can support them to be even better\nRight so I really I Love this particular point that Dominican women have higher college graduation rates in New York City than any other demographic in the Latino population so what's up with that\nReally interesting I think there are a lot of questions that are raised and a lot we can learn from parts\nI think there are a lot of questions that are raised in a lot we can learn from particularly in comparison to to some others but Latino non Latino\nOne thing we think is that the Dominican community in New York like in Washington Heights is interesting in that you have a lot of groups from different incomes living together because it's a relatively new or immigrant group actually compare to Puerto Ricans\nThe schools that are majority Dominican schools you have both lower and higher income families from Dominican origins and what we find\nIs that when you have mixed schools around socio economics the culture pervades all the different groups in the school so the college going culture of the middle and higher income Dominican families really pervades to lower income families as well which is why in those schools you really see much more of a college going culture\nAnd among women in particular which is it's real bright spot [noise]\n\nNow in comparison to Puerto Rican community in New York has been here much longer and you find that some higher and middle income Puerto Ricans in New York and other parts of the country aren't living in the same neighborhoods [noise] so where there are some concentrated Puerto Rican communities in areas of New York you're not having those mix of incomes in the school and college going culture may not be a strong\nHalf need each so there's a whole conversation Ron desegregation of data it sounds like a very technical thing but what it really means is when you're taking big data and you're kind of making it into smaller bite sized pieces is that a conversation that is being had regarding Latinos and letting the United states increasingly\nI think we're seeing the value of diversity in our analysis and now I think the next step is\nNow says and now I think the next step is we're such a diverse community within Latinos how do we really show the differences within them and a show the needs and strength of different communities\nAnd we're really on and exciting frontier as people start to think about diversity and identity differently on the United states census\nBureau's animal Community Survey which is really the baseline survey that we use for so much of our work there's a question about race and then there's the next question about it in a city\nSo in race people are largely answering whether they considered themselves white black or an Asian background or other and then the next question is are you Hispanic", "show_name": "Latino USA", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "29"}
