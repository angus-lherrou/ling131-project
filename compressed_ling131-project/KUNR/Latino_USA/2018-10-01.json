I started reading a letter in the first thing that my father said you know dear Shani indeed slated I'm telling you that your brother or they handle had passed away and I'm like I I just stop there and I started crying and I probably went crazy I don't\nKnow my mom and called her other brothers to ask what happened\nBut nobody wanted to say anything but later on my brother he said to me when we went into a cemetery where some sun you so I'm dead in one came and took to me and he said you know we know and you find any so just even liked that\nHis family was told not to ask questions about it at all but how could they not\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAlex was in college at the time so instead of wielding a gun he was in charge of recruiting and educating students to the group's political ideology Alex remained a member of the far until Nineteen Ninety six and a sort of a ministry of position never in combat a year later\nCentral America's longest and most brutal civil war has come to

sure whether to believe that so many relatives were secretly gorilla\nAnd this is the ... and we'll check in the early and yeah you did on the in the least I thought I see the ... yet and yet ...\nSays the guerrilla fighters inflated their membership rolls of innocent civilians so that they would seem bigger than they really were even if those civilians had no affiliation with the insurgent groups in real life so it was difficult to know whether my uncle ... or anyone else in the family was actually involved in or [noise]\n\nLike me my cousin's curiosity grew with he got older and a few years later he started his own investigation into what really happened to his dad\nHis quest took 'em to amounted lined the town where the family recovered his father's body he spoke to retired gorillas in the area and local law enforcement and the story he pieced together it was very different than the one ... told me\nThis story makes more sense if you consider how dangerous Guatemala was in those days and why my family might have wanted to hide the real reasons for my uncle's death\nWhen a ... ... if you if you get\nIf I ... that can be if you if you get your own in ... and we're not feeling\nFrom Alex discovered where his dad died on a farm all trying to collect the famous war tax the war tax was with the grill is charged farms in rural areas to help support

guerilla fighter\nThe other version is that he was a guerilla fighter who was extorting people and ended up mutilated by the military given how different these two stories are I asked my cousin about the origins of the bar story after all the bar room version wasn't in any newspaper it was what my uncles told us\nYou don't put as soon as I mean a set of baking no fighting a less they look at the U.S will say these poor people yep I thought I Will build my cousin\nWe do know that they look at the actual city of ... up I thought I looked at my cousin said that after his father died people threatened the family and told them all not to talk about what happened\nAlex things maybe this is when our family decided to tell the love triangle story instead and he says it's okay for them to have their version he's keeping his gaze again because if you don't get your mechanical niche you\n... ...\n... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ...\nI don't know if in the end my uncle oh Hondros a hero or a villain I'd heard that the fog of war treats situations like my uncles were the trees campaigns down\nBut I didn't expect was that people could come to prefer this fog [noise]\nFrom my mom excavating such awful stories about her brother is something she wants to avoid\nWhich is partly why she's only returned to Guatemala a handful of times in the last forty years\nAnd I noticed that some people said that to me why one that was the one I didn't want to use as I don't want to ...
