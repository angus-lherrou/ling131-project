social codes that requires women to remain silent out of the shades of their views is to which they had been subjected to\nYears ago as ... street fighters enslaved fell\nThe four years ago Islamic state fighters enslaved thousands of women and girls in Iraq many were repeatedly raped and sexually abused in other words\nNot humor odd was one of those women she was only Twenty one years old at the time and from a tiny but ancient religious minority group the ...\n... people that they are very it\nDid just on a simple life they they can they can leave we any group in Iraq in even hand but em they are they're very ... these people when they do yeah they just want\nTo live in in peace and fixing\nTo feel safe I talked to an audience brought in NPR's Washington studios earlier this week it was her first full interview since she won the Nobel Peace prize with the help of an interpreter she spoke mostly in ... which is her native language about what she now hopes to achieve\nUm um diminution um we have set it over and over\nThat it's important for us the justice is done out of the six thousand years ET women who were abducted by ISIS we hope to see at least one ISIS number who did this to one me as a woman to be punished for the crimes they committed against gives me the women and we hope to see them in court in public\nIt is easy to see winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of combination or end of a person's career you've you've done what you set out to do in your case at twenty four years old that is clearly not true you clearly feel like you have a lot left to do what is next\nFeel like you have a lot left to do what is next for you after winning the prize\nAnd I'm twenty five to twenty five ... and ...\nAfter I delivered our method and we have as a community

the word what do you feel every day or what chemicals to showed him ah\nYou know like I said what makes us feel good at least is that we are delivering a peaceful massive die we are not delivering a message to hurt anyone when I meet with students and the presidents and anyone I speak about what happened to us and I deliver my message with a clear conscience that I advocate for people\nOur half hour interview not humor odd seemed at times pretty shattered but also strong she says that strength comes from her UCD identity she calls the rape of using the women and the murder of UCD men including many people in her own family a genocide she wants to these atrocities to be classified as war crimes\nShe wants these atrocities to be classified as war crimes but even after winning the Nobel Peace prize she's not sure if that's going to happen and she sometimes finds herself frustrated\n... sometimes I feel that my message has not been clearly heard what that is not my fault because I feel like too much is going on in terms of woman being victims and it's not the first time and certainly it's not the last time\nAnd perhaps every year a woman someplace in the world or groups of woman or thousands will be victims of sexual violence or terrorist groups and so I feel like this is not new to people and it's not going to be the last time and people have become numb to this kind of news\nI'm your mother your mother was killed by the Islamic state and I wonder when you think about her now\nWhat do you think she would think about everything that you've done what do you think

district thirty six tell us a little bit about that race\nYou know so I think it's fair to say that Hoffman's ways this year when he was able to unseat incumbent Republican assemblyman James Oscar sent in last June's primary\nOne of the biggest issues in that campaign was Oscar some support for the creation of commerce tax and twenty fifth came with district thirty six being so conservative many voters saw that as an unconscionable and he was supposed to face Democrat leaves Romanoff in the general election\nAnd so what happens now does his name actually still appear on the ballot\nHappens now of his name actually still up here on the ballot\nYes it absolutely does a so under Nevada revised statutes candidate to die after the fourth friday in July must remain on the ballot in addition to all requires at the county clerk's office post signs and every polling place within the district of learning voters to the candidates that\nPart of the reason is because ballots have already been printed also there's just not enough time for another candidate to step in and take his place could Elaine what happens if he wins so here's what's going to get interesting in a bit complicated\nThan about a constitutional requires that if there's a vacancy for any legislative position than the decision on who replaces the lawmaker is left up to the county commission\nNow there's some rules state law dictates that whoever replaces haw laughter come from the same political party but that since eighty thirty six isn't just in one county commissioners for nine Clark and Lincoln counties will all get a say on who replaces him how is that even work\nWell if if off when the the the three county commissions will meet to vote on who they support for the office\nThan the commission chairs we'll get together and convened to vote on which are the possible three candidates will be selected here's where it's getting a tricky those three counties don't get an equal vote the size of their vote is based on how many people from each county live within the district\nSo there's roughly forty four thousand voters and district thirty six two thirds of them live in a county or car county has about a third and Lincoln county has just about one percent so that means whoever night county select from the scenario is very likely going to be the next assembly person for district\nScenario is very likely going to be the next assembly person for district thirty six\nEverything we've been talking about up to this point has been hypothetical I mean at the end of the day will people and district thirty six actually vote for a dead person on the ballot\nAt this point it's very likely and for reasons for that is that part of the state is very Republican Republicans outnumber Democrats almost two to one in a normal year a GOP candidate would walk away with a win almost every single time but this is anything but a normal election year\nSo far this election has been pretty unpopular he won the primary but he wasn't getting support you'd see from other candidates top of the candidates like lax on Dean Heller have done their best to distance themselves from the buffalo owner of the very caucus the off was trying to get into the assembly Republicans refused to endorse him\nIn addition to the allegations of sexual assault against them from former bravo workers puff had a tough row to hoe unloaded otherwise an easy win for Republicans\nSo all of that being said it's possible that Republicans who would otherwise not voted for Hamas will vote for him simply because we can't serve and that could open the doors for somebody like James Oscars and to reclaim the\nOne other aspect to consider here is that half was involved in another race blind counties question one it's a measure asking residents whether the county should ban legal ... what is ... death mean for that particular ballot initiatives\nMorning at seven o'clock\nWhat makes

founder is an American woman named Katie ... she has thousands of social media followers\nThey're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lower\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl\nOn the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girl on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff\nHelping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its undercut the mile or had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts bubble make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did she start this organization\nKatie my there's a woman from New Jersey who had along background in doing various forms of yeah community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on a an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there to continue their relationship with the country and she started up which are the first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow in ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia are demanding Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nEm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante group which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the area of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\nCan you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way to keep using these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my I had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview\nBut that same year in twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nJohnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think is rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that but he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports and to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nHim or potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually we're going to bring a case they were re tested and one of them tested positive\nIt's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools were the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if for organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this abuse that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nIt is for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points that organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nIn Liberia still a lousy organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community had the sense of a lot of people had a feeling that something had gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on\nOn the government has not just a a full investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we heard was a process for credit thing these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat we Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since his story was published Katie my lawyer has temporarily stepped down a CEO of more than me this is NPR News\nAs soon as the toughest building cars in the country but certain areas are exempt from rules to protect them against storms like hurricane Michael and arrived or shaking\nProtect them against storms like hurricane

of woman being victims\nIt's not the first time and certainly is not the last time\nAnd perhaps every year a woman's someplace in the world or groups of woman or thousands will be victims of sexual
