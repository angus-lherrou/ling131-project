you're saying is the narrow margins by which no seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys won the dry you got the drawing even though you lost a lot of ground in the election\nYou got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election how much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber wanted them being Wisconsin in two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority and votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where they came from right\n[noise] well I Would raise a couple of points on that first and foremost the system we've designed as to have local representative that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nHave that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the state wide level um UC ... Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country how if at all do you advise\nAll across the country how if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand eight team\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if they're a winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district that Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win\nPricing local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically to be more focus on sort of installing a ... a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a and a more conservative philosophy wants to defuse that power out to the localities\nThat's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic\nFlooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents have been told to boil their drinking water most ... of member station ... has more\nRushing into Austin reservoirs has the look of chocolate\nIt's been so turned off by flooding\nIt's been so turned off by flooding that is around ... even when it goes Austin's treatment plant it takes a lot longer to filter so on Monday the city told people to conserve\nWater and as a precaution to boil what they were going to use for drinking in food ... [noise] you can probably guess what happened next and I'm ...\n... ... yesterday Maggie Chapman was one of a bunch of shoppers at a supermarket wheeling out bottles of water supply had improving the day before when shells were bear after stores started to limit\nHow many bottles people could buy it just inconvenient at this point but I keep thinking about you know just ... that we use water I hadn't even thought about\nWhat kinds of things some restaurants are closed cafes aren't serving so you meet a lot of people desperate for coffee and on a more serious note the city of San Antonio simple water tank or to help keep the local jail supplied with drinking water and the city of Austin worried about maintaining water pressure in its system\nWe've been providing water for a hundred years this has never happened to us this is blowing our mind to\nRecognize there is is the director of the city's water utility he said after all that silk slowed water treatment the city's system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure\nIf he loses too much pressure to city won't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fires and water and pipes risks getting contaminated as micro organism sneak into holes and openings they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news is there are says is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and ...\nUsing less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nHe says if conservation continues and the weather cooperates things could start returning to normal by this weekend if heavy rains kick up more silt and the river is could

a bomb was apparently center the home of the financier George Soros\nWe should emphasize at this moment we don't know much about the seriousness of the story but we do know that it's happening and we're going to bring you up to date and what we do know with NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan good morning the morning how much is\nJustice reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan good morning the morning how much is the secret service saying\nWell they aren't saying a whole lot right now and this is something that really is just breaking news on they have sent out a statement at this point in what they are saying is that a secret service intercepted too suspicious packages one was addressed to Hillary Clinton at her home in Westchester County New York that one was discovered late last night\nAnd then early this morning or the secret service uh intercepted a second package that was addressed to block Obama here in Washington DC\nThe former president has a home here in Washington right\nAnd what the Secret Service is saying is that both packages were immediately identified during routine screening as potential explosive devices or they say that neither Clinton or Obama ever received the packages they weren't in their hands they weren't in their houses but they were addressed to them that's as as far as they got\nA the secret service is working with the FBI with uh the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives\nOn is one of the state and local law enforcement or try to figure out as much as they can\nYou've had something meaningful here because there are a lot of different things that could be in a suspicious package I'm Sorry to say but they're saying potential explosive devices that provided are kind of threat here which brings us to this other threats something was discovered being sent to George Soros what was that\nThat was a a pipe bomb was found in the mailbox of sources home or in a suburb of New York it was filled with explosive powder

Greene and I'm Steve Inskeep Republicans want to preserve their power on this fall's elections Democrats want to take some of the power away\nYou know the older you didn't see at uh\nOur way or the audience they had a faith based approach to mid term elections they always say that the candidates would win but we didn't do myself democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments asked\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group as the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWell when you're an all time highs you are naturally playing defense and when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the mean\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYes you have a one seat majorities in a Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding\nOr what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nGuess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and\nIt up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys won the dry you got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election how much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans\nWere in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on uh the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber one of them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appeared to have a big majority in votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing the district lines that's where they came from right well\nI Would raise a couple of points on that\nFirst and foremost the system we've designed as to have local representative that people can count on carrying the interests of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical but what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the state wide level um you've seen Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected\nUm you've seen Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump the\nState legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand to that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand eight team\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if there are winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district that Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win\nPricing local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically to be more focused on sort of installing a ... a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a and a more conservative philosophy wants to defuse that power out to the localities\nThat's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic flooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents have been told to boil their drinking water most ... of member station ... has more [noise]\nShell's member station ... has more [noise]\nRushing into Austin reservoirs has the look\nIt's been so turned off by flooding brown SEAL Team and when it goes Austin's treatment plant it

never happened to us this is blowing our mind to\n... is the director of the city's water utility he says after all that silk slowed water treatment the city's system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure\nIf he loses too much pressure that said he won't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fires and water and pipes risks getting contaminated as microorganisms sneak into holes and openings they wouldn't normally access the good news is there are says it's\nAccess the good news is there are says is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nHe says if

annual celebration the popular in Nevada Day parade in this segment of time and place\nTo most Americans October thirty first is Halloween but to residents of the silver state it's also Nevada Day commemorating the date and Eighteen sixty four when did that it became that thirty six said in a union\nThey became a judicial holiday and Eighteen Ninety One at an official state holiday a few decades later for many years the official celebration was held in Reno\nBut in Nineteen thirty eight a group of service organizations banded together to move the entire event to the state capital of Carson City where it's organizers were determined to keep it non political historical pageant in a series of speeches were held on the Capitol Grounds with one stipulation no one who was running for office was allowed to speak\nThat didn't stop candidates from appearing in the parade however\nAnd especially in election years writing the route has become a political mainstay providing candidates with a chance to connect with the public and enjoy some free media coverage\nAbout a week before election day guy farmer worked for and about his gaming control born in the mid sixties when he lent is important to grant Sawyer who is campaigning for a third term as governor something was only allowed until Nineteen Seventy farmer looked back on some of their campaign tactics and two thousand and

days was smoke on the politics\nSue Wagner was serving as a state senator when she ran successfully for lieutenant governor in Nineteen Ninety and a two thousand three interview she recalled how the rules governing the Nevada Day parade gave her a distinct advantage during her campaign\nHe could not be in that prayed at that time unless you actually held an office so if you were running is somebody that was a non incumbent for anything\nThey couldn't be hurting could and I was able to be into grade choir she my running for those kind of evidence to state senator from a next door county and it didn't look that politically motivated\nThese days any qualified candidate can right in the parade which is farmer explain has practically become a political requirement\nTo have pretty much after making the parents who you see most of the candidates still here and then the other day parade and the senator Brian's truly food than there are certain things here where it's good to be seeing
