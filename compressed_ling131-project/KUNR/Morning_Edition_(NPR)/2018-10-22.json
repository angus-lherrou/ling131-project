U. when ours ... thanks for joining me happy to be here\nHow can you what can you tell us about the debate between Jacky Rosen and Dean Heller what was the tone like\nYou know I think the nicest way I saw described a was has the\nThink I Would call a brutal and vicious to be honest the over the hour long debate both Rosen in Hillary tax covered the Detroit be attacked each other's records\nThey lobbed accusations back and forth they interrupted one another uh regularly speaking over one another out a few occasions even laughed at each other's answers um I I think it's fair to say the spirit of the debate did well to keep with in sync with the tone of the election that this far\nA it was negative in many ways personal\nUm so uh what about Heller what were his key points\nYou know looking at a Dean Heller uh I I think senator ... or how really outperformed his opponent when he was talking about his experience at a seniority\nOr our did his level best to emphasize his record over the course of the last twelve years and both the house in the Senate or he talked about the number of bills he's passed he he his recent rank he knows the fifth most by\nBill he's passed he he his recent ranking as the fifth most bipartisan member of the Senate and the senator or talked about his seniority or as a boom for the state of the whole I mean objectively Rosen is doesn't have the most experienced she's a freshman congresswoman and doesn't the naturally doesn't have the largest record\nThat being said how are also highlighted his ability to ally himself with the president however was not a fan of the president prior to the twenty sixteen election however in the nearly two years since taking office\nHe's developed a relationship with Trump in whether you like them or not a relationship with the president is a useful thing\nNow talking about a congresswoman Rosen a ... you know it was the topic of the first you know health care was a major topic per debate\nAnd I think that's where congresswoman released a scored the most points throughout the debate time and again she used the topic to highlight senator ... votes to read his last the last year of repeal effort\nOr he off she often referred to tell her last year in office as well as rubber stamp for the president she's also wrote repeated the refrain refrain that she's challenged the Republican or to really tell why he broke his promise quote unquote\nTo demand and when he promised to protect healthcare what about some of the other major issues that came out\nI I think the clearest demonstration on the differences between the two came up during the question on gun control reform in weather background checks should be expanded the private sales\nAnd transfers in Rosen says she supported expanding background checks to include private sales and restricting the sale things like bump stocks you know Heller countered with by reiterating his support for the second amendment\nNow on the topic of federal lands Heller highlighted his work to open veal and land to do more development arguing that it would ease the state's housing shortages will pass\nTo to more development arguing that it would ease the state's housing shortages will possibly creating more economic growth in rural areas rose and on the other hand disagree by arguing that public lands were already a major ... for the state and that there are large source of revenue and the current state\nSo you've mentioned that you know debate was pretty testy you was there any common ground between the two you know I think\nThese two did everything they could to distance to distance themselves from one another hour or something I found interesting is that veterans issues has come up a lot in this election in particular and I mean it makes sense there's a there's a lot of military installations in Nevada therefore there's a lot of veterans in this state\nAnd both candidates did talk a lot about what they would promise to get done or what if they were sent back to Washington so do you think this debate changed anybody's mind\nAnd you know I really can't say we're we're going to get some voter turnout numbers here in the next few days with early voting maybe we'll see um some sort of difference\nDreaming on line that can you win our dot org that can you in our public radio apple or by telling your smart speaker to
