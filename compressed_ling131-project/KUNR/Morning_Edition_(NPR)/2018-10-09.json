greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nOh shortage glued to the Jews what happened to me to record\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison\nWhere Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender

feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as\nEffective in the courtroom for my client\nUnless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWhile there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase bail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for
