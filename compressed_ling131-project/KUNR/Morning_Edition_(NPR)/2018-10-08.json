office seekers in Nevada are crisscrossing stayed working to drum up support a head of the election in November\nTo break down this election so far can you when ours Paul ... spoke with longtime Truckee Meadows community college political science professor ... what do you make of this particular election so far\n[noise] well in many ways it's a typical Nevada election we really don't know what's going on we have no reliable source of data\nAt least in northern Nevada it seems to be a less energized environment than I understand in this in Clark County\nBut that doesn't surprise me I think that's a typical pattern in the state as well or the Democratic party especially is far better organized in clerk and much of the focus some activities in Seventy percent of voters are in Clark County but it makes sense for the Democrats have Sebastian a stronghold for them\nSo I think we would feel like there's more of an election underway whereas here it's like it's been flying under the radar for for ever since the primary\nFor for ever since the primary and then for the coverage you know frankly the local media his I think than a little slow and stepping up or to start doing the coverage we're just now starting to see some debates get started in last week's of the campaign so it's been kind of a sleeper as far as I'm concerned\nBut it it does seem particularly contentious alleys looking at some of the election material and some of the ways that these candidates are talking about each other it is particularly negative\nCampaign is being waged in the mailbox or which I find really fascinating and the reality is that it has been overwhelmingly negative or the television ads of course or the other place that the uh the battle is being waged and that has been\nNinety eight percent plus negative as well that means a lot of out of state money is coming into the state because most of the advertising that's negative is not coming from the ... campaigns is coming from either dark sources or the various ah usual suspects\nI'm curious what do you see as the major issues in this particular election because it it kind of seems like they're all over the place especially when you start looking at some of the questions and adding a little bit more confusion into what this election or what isn't actually at stake in this particular election\nThe issues at this time around is really about the candidates themselves not the issues that they want to stand for\nIt's really remarkable that Dean Heller finds himself as the incumbent in such a weak position but most of it is self imposed is waffling or if you will on a national health care issue making one\nThe national healthcare issue making one promise to the governor and then looking like he was basically bullied into supporting the Trump Persian and Washington has seemingly had a devastating impact on trustworthiness and character\nFor Rosen it turned experience but in this election year two thousand Eighteen not being attached to the political process\nReally sets you apart and makes you attractive to a lot of voters so they've been desperately trying to connect her to polo see or to the you did to the left him in California but I don't think it's sticking out at this point in time\nSo in that race you would think it would be all about the issues are and it has not been it's been all about the candidates\nAnd the governor's race it's also about personality in one case a ... who is relatively unfamiliar in ... north of the of the northern border of Clark County sound of joke that he doesn't realize they're sixteen other counties in the state and that's probably true his entire political career\nHas been based and rooted in the south\nBut for lack solved the at least the the perception of someone who's kind of a carpetbagger to the states who doesn't have any real ties here who was brought back in his finance substantially from outside of the state so again it's not the issues that they want to run on\nThat I've seen anybody talking about it is literally talking about the candidates so over the to stand out elections of two thousand Eighteen it's literally personality character over any kind of campaign issue\n\n\nGood morning it's six o'clock ooh\nGood morning Brett Kavanaugh is now it's Supreme Court justice there'll be a ceremonial swearing in

for sheriff this election she has also recently suits the sheriff's office for gender discrimination you win our Stephanie serrano talked with how to break it all down\nWelcome Haiti thank you thank you for having me here before we get in the air campaign we have to talk about the fact that you are now suing the Walsh show county sheriff's office and the current sheriff shut Allen a story at the Reno Gazette journal broke why are you doing\nWell um I'm not going to talk about the details of the case I don't know what that play out the way it's supposed to but a lot of people know that the complaint is out there if people want to go out there and read what's in it and I would encourage them to do so it'll let them know what's really going on\nAre the issues that are in that complaint is nothing new it's been going on for decades I have to look at what I Am and what I'm saying my messages and holding myself true to that\nUm for folks who don't understand there are deadlines that coming into play and I had to make it very difficult decision\nOn whether to file or let it go forever I think it's my obligation as a leader to stick my neck out there and try and protect employees that work in the agency and I made that decision\nSo you're suing the organization you want to be the leader of is that a conflict of interest\nPeter of is that a conflict of interests are you concerned about the topic of your campaign\nWell obviously there's going to be people who are going to agree or disagree with what I'm doing a ultimately it's about fixing the culture and what's occurring there I'm if I'm the sheriff there I can fix it\nLet's talk about your campaign don't tell me about an experience you've had in law enforcement has prepared you for this role\nAnd the biggest\nPiece that I Would say prepared me was being the captain of the jail it's half the budget almost half the staff as an average daily population of approximately eleven hundred inmates a day is like renting a small city doing that was a massive responsibility\nAnd something that I embrace loved doing\nAnd being the sheriff very very similar to that is understanding the agency as a whole\nWhich being around for twenty six years and twenty of those years I was a sergeant lieutenant or captain meeting in a supervisory role but now I Want to take that background that experience and convert that over into being a leader of an organization\nSo there's been concerns about how inmates are treated in Washington County detention center what will you do to improve the situation\nThe biggest thing that we need to be tackling is the training of our staff we needed to invest in our people and make sure that we're providing them scenario based training in order to make better decisions and how they interact with the inmate population up front and\nAnd up front and what I've seen over the years is that when budgets are cut training budgets are typically one of the first go\nAnd then in order to save money and show that you've provided some training in particular areas they'll put it on video platform which I don't believe really teaches people how to process their own emotions and adrenaline when they're in a difficult situation scenario training does a better job of that\nSo you can actually see somebody and under pressure and a little bit of stress and how they are reacting what kind of support do you plan to provide for inmates who do have mental illness there is a thing called the national health services corps which trains people kind of in an internship situation\nFor different medical and mental health professions\nWhat I Would like is if we could make the jail at training site for the national health services corps and then we'd be able to have more new people come in and work with our inmate population and if we're lucky keep some of those individuals in our community on a more permanent basis\nThat was Heidi how a candidate and the

working working to drum up support a head of the November election to break down the election that's far KU in ours Paul ... spoke with long time Truckee Meadows community college political science professor ... ...\nWhat do you make of this particular election so far\n[noise] well in many ways as a typical Nevada election we really don't know what's going on we have no reliable source of data\nAt least in northern Nevada it seems to be a less energized environment than I understand it as in Clark County\nBut that doesn't surprise me I think that's a typical pattern of the state as well or the Democratic party especially as far better organized and Clark and much of the focus in activities in Seventy percent of voters are in Clark County it makes sense for the Democrats as Sebastian or a stronghold for them\nSo I think we would feel like there's more of an election underway whereas here it's like it's been flying under the radar for for ever since the primary\nAnd then for the coverage you know frankly the local media his I think been a little slow and stepping up to start doing the coverage we're just now starting to see some debates get started in the last week the campaign\nSo it's been kind of a sleeper as far as I'm concerned\nBut it it does seem particularly contentious alleys looking at some of the election\nTruly contentious alleys looking at some of the election material and some of the ways that these candidates are talking about each other it is particularly negative\nThe campaign is being waged in the mailbox which I find really fascinating and the reality is that it has been overwhelmingly negative or the television ads of course or the other place that the uh the battle is being waged and that has been\nNinety eight percent plus negative as well that means a lot of out of state money is coming into the state because most of the advertising that's negative is not coming from the ... campaigns is coming from either dark sources or the various ah usual suspects\nI'm curious what do you see as the major issues in this particular election because it it kind of seems like they're all over the place especially when you start looking at some of the questions and adding a little bit more confusion into what this election or what isn't actually at stake in this particular election\nThe issues at this time around is really about the candidates themselves not the issues that they want to stand for\nIt's really remarkable that Dean Heller finds himself as the incumbent in such a weak position but most of it is self imposed is waffling or if you will on a national health care issue\nMaking one promise to the governor and then looking like he was basically bullied into supporting the Trump Persian and Washington has seemingly had a devastating impact on trustworthiness and character\nFor Rosen at CERN experience but in this election year of two thousand Eighteen not being attached to the political process\nBeing attached to the political process\nReally sets us apart and makes you attractive to a lot of voters so there'd been desperately trying to connect her to polo see or to the you did to the left him in California but I don't think it's sticking out at this point in time\nSo in that race you would think it would be all about the issues are and it has not been it's been all about the candidates\nAnd the governor's race it's also about personality in one case a ... who is relatively unfamiliar in ... north of the of the northern border of our county some jokes that he doesn't realize they're sixteen other counties in the state and that's probably true his entire political career\nHas been based in rooted in the south\nBut for lack solved the at least the the perception of someone who's kind of a carpetbagger to the state doesn't have any real ties here who was brought back in his finance substantially from outside of the state so again it's not the issues that they want to run on\nThat I've seen anybody talking about it is literally talking about the candidates so over the to stand out elections of two thousand Eighteen it's literally personality and character
