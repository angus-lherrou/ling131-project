president talked of trying to eliminate citizenship for children born in the U.S to immigrants who are here illegally he says he could use an executive order although the Republican speaker of the house Paul Ryan says that is not possible\nMichael Anton is with us next the former White House aide was written in support of ending birthright citizenship and that particular case Mr rant on walking back to the program Hi thank you for having I have to know the president raised this idea in his campaign years ago but hasn't tried it since now raises it suddenly days before the election is this

any reason whether there is there is a tourist whether there on business whether they're just transiting through as a matter of travel they're subject to the law of that country while they're there\nYou know so be physically present means you're subject to the law in a sentence defining citizenship therefore subject to the jurisdiction must have another meaning will or else it's super fluid and re done\nWell there's this subject in jurisdiction there are when I've done some reading on this it appears to me that that applies to people like foreign diplomats who have immunity from

I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence for forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain\nHow does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people in in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snow flakes and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct\nAnd because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and in rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through\nSays I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your about your evolution\nI have been avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still

Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep with China is testing a new plan it's stated aim is to make it easier for citizens to do business and help them to trust each other more\nIt's similar to the American credit score but much more sweeping attracts far more than financial transactions and it's called the social credit score Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast explains\nMany people in China don't have bank accounts don't really have much of a credit history so China has never created something quite like the American credit score and so there is\nFor lack of a better way to trust deficit in China the ease ... economic activity\nRachel ... teaches trust and technology and is the author of who can you trust\nShe says a lack of trust in people and businesses has held China's economy back so in China decided to make a centralized score the government turned to people's behaviors to extrapolate trustworthiness from them and you know who has lots of data on how people behave\nFrom them and you know who has lots of data on how people behave companies especially big companies like Ali Baba that is China's version of Amazon Ali Baba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country\nAnd has its own credit scoring system called sesame credit so the government has been working with Ali Baba in the development of people's social credit score\nThe way people that school is not seem to do and they miss a bill it could be what they buy online I mean I think the example that the head of sesame credit public they gave the press was you know if you buy not to use your responsible so your school go out but if you buy video games you lazy CEO school go down\nBut the credit score will not be all about what you by the government is also collecting data its own and that data will factor into people's social credit scores to the social credit system is not scheduled to be rolled out nationally until twenty twenty\nBut we got a glimpse into how it might work because China is testing out versions of it in pilots cities across the country\nWe talked to a thirty two year old IT engineer named Huron John he lives in wrong Chong which is one of those pilots cities and she joined explained that everyone in the city starts with a score of one thousand one single thing that my score is full score\nSo when thousands and there's a whole letter grade system behind the points so from nine hundred and sixty to a thousand plus points isn't a eight hundred and fifty nine fifty nine points is\nEight forty nine to six hundred is a seat and this is considered a warning level\nBelow that you are a D you're labeled in untrustworthy citizen you can get points for all kinds of reasons get a DUI that is an automatic downgrade to be and if you spread rumors on line minus fifty points if you have a really high scores\nOr is on line minus fifty points if you really high score you get discounts and a bunch of local businesses your heating bill can go down you also get special invitations to community events sure on John says it's made people behave better before the pilot program being a pedestrian and wrong Sean was just terrifying\nYou basically had to hurl yourself across the street when you saw breaking traffic\nIn that genre but now after um the changes have happened the cars that will wait for you\nKnow remember she John is an example of somebody with a perfect score if you're a social credit score is low or if you end up on something called the list of untrustworthy people you can be banned from certain

visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and

resentments and hatred that his base in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy than he is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guys semi who might have

raised this idea in his campaign years ago but hasn't tried it sense now raises it suddenly days before the election is this anything more than an election ploy\nWell I think so first of all he raised it in response to an asked questions so everyone who was looking for some kind of um you know deeply cynical motive here is wrong or he was asked the question apparently it's something he had been discussing with the staff for many weeks\nYeah he did say he'd been talking about a reporter\nGot wind of that and ask him about it and he gave an honest answer I I also I you know I have to take

will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman\nWays in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity did I hear that you've been taking online quizzes to figure out where you actually live in the eye\n[laughter] because I think so too I\nI just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that it seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have\nTo believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nOr we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and yeah the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nPolitics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's when I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape\nIt was after the twenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and immigration because I saw all these families\nInvolved and that's what led me to working in immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with us when it would go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me\nAnd believing that there's another solution that there is a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the rights that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't and\n[noise] I understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely identified how did those how did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nAn issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough evidence brought forward for me to fully believe\nThere was just not quite enough evidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't\nKnow [noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people in in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nGuess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct and because it's\nThe first time despite President Trump correct and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic checked boxes I\nI Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican and upcoming elections [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nAbout your evolution I have [laughter] than avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the

behave\nCompanies especially big companies like Ali Baba that is China's version of Amazon Ali Baba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country\nAnd has its own credit scoring system called sesame credit\nSo the government has been working with Ali Baba in the development of people's social credit score\nThe way people that school is not somebody when they miss a bill it could be what they buy online I mean I think the example that the head of sesame credit public they gave the press was you know if you buy nineties your responsible so your school go out but if you buying video games you lazy CEO school go down\nBut it's a credit score will not be all about what you by the government is also collecting data its own and that data will factor into people's social credit

last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the\nTree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a person holding us I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody\nThat from a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean the President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says\nOn the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says he's deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio here the smartest me [noise]\nThey talking about talking about the the lead you ever see the elite\nSays when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews getting nervous\nThe danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether in Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and Herve is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentment and hatred that his base in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy than he is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the ... union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guys semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they can find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has\nHi Defamation League says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply\nOver the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once vacant stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas shops

getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent many landlords use to shine short term leases but Steve shorts with commercial real estate service jails says that view appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit um it really allows a landlord to activate the storefront in activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're

anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stores may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect the model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercials spaces CEO Mohammed oh wash says everyone's using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich is you know so the push coming from ...

day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota and a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quiz is to figure out where you actually lined the fat\n[laughter] because I Do too I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it\nSomewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes yeah I almost feel guilt\nThat I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nOr we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the other kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's when I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape\nShort it was after\nThe twenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working in immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and and some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I Want to go pay bond or go down to the government\nLightning moments I had were when I did work with ice when it would go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me\nAnd believing that there's another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots and liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I had an and\n[noise] I understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely I did how did those how did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I\nThere was just not quite enough evidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people in\nFrom what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people in in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nGuess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican and upcoming election [noise]\nSo yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nAbout your evolution I have been avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so I'll do my research and whoever I think is best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism\nAlexa grooming thank you so much for talking with us I think you know\nI
