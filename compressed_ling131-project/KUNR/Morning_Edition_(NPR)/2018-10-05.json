this morning\nI'd go see I I you know I Wonder if you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and and what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then he senators you know they all ...\nAnd there's this era of of disagreement but then he senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how the culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and an all this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up which is not normal um there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I have seen president I'm from just about any vote of any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about in American politics for the past year or so\nThere seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills a passing a bill they they are doing those basic pieces of governance\nBut as soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy there with each other how lie all the other side as well still getting to the basics of government on Washington if they can continue to do that or if these fights towers them for more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to uh or other colleague Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington ... they did so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of this for re have Grassley I I think a Dianne Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nAnd we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't call it there's not a hard time limit on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more a before then we're going to hear from four key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley\nFor key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford for many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have gone I Know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides and both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will that last remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years for example somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago\nSo I don't remember I remember that I got a vaguely remembered something in the past about that yeah\nYou know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of tension within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race for mid summer until now and a lot of people see the Kavanaugh fight as a key reason a lot of Republicans\nFeeling feeling a under siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying this\nFloor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard\nLet's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of that\nSexual assault even under the lowest standard approve she concluded quote\nA he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this cases even weaker than that Dr Ford identify other witnesses to the event so knows witnesses either refuted or allegations or fail to wreak\nCorroborate them for the reasons discuss belong I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor could bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee ... nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy their preponderance of evidence standard end\nQuote so\nHave thoroughly investigated judge Kavanaugh's background in addition to the prior six FBI fall feel feel background investigations were the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who have known judge Kavanaugh his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegation that we received are more than twenty committee staff members have more night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leads and at the request of undecided members\nThe FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nKavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interviewed can more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations and the FBI confirm what we Senate investigators already concluded that is is there's nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know\nThese on corroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by a judge Kavanaugh and neither the Judiciary Committee or the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations\nThere also is no contemporary contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hand of misconduct and the same is true of six prior FBI investigations\nAre conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service\nNothing and investigator including career FBI special agents does ever\nBe good enough\nTo satisfy Democrat leaderships in Washington who staked out opposition to judge Kavanaugh before he was even nominated\nThere is simply no reason then to the judge Kavanaugh a seat on the Supreme Court on the basis of the evidence presented to us the Democratic strategy used against judge Kavanaugh has made one thing clear\nThey will never be satisfied no matter how fair and ...\nSatisfy no matter how fair and through the process is thirty one years ago the Senate Democrats treatment as Robert Bork\nOr playbook remains the same for the left wing advice and consent has become sort\nOf listening to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices from the United States Senate as they prepare to vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court to vote again today is to end debate the formal vote to actually confirm or not\nWould probably be sometime tomorrow we just heard a reference there to Robert Bork a man who was a nominated to the Supreme Court by president Ronald Reagan in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd ultimately rejected after a campaign by Democrats who said that his views were extreme Charles Grassley argues that essentially the same thing is happening now that Brett Kavanaugh as being born to which is the way the conservatives refer to this neither Totenberg is that a fair comparison\nWell I actually don't think it's a fair comparison I'm Robert Bork nomination has been a sore point for Republicans now ever since it happened ever since he was defeated\nAnd there's been a lot of academic studies now of the confirmation process and how Bork fared and the fact is that Bork went into his confirmation hearings with the votes to easily be confirmed\nA liberal interests did have some ads against him and they were chump change compared to what the money that spent today I mean I think they mainly aired in Washington\nTo where the money that's been today I mean I think they mainly aired in Washington DC so that they would get written about by the likes of being me [noise] um but\nBarks views it turned out he answered the questions quite forthrightly he I didn't have very strong and he had very strong views and quite as it turned out in the view of many Americans and their senators extreme view this\nCase Kavanaugh has pulled his punches quite deliberately not quite said what does the U.S because\nActually correct so bored for example said he's sticking to his you that the one person one vote decision was wrong\nCavanaugh a would not\nReally express his views on almost anything he he would always say that's Supreme Court precedent um I I as a judge had to follow the Supreme Court precedent or things like that so they're really they're not hurting\nLet me stop you there because Charles Groat lose finished his speech a now Dianne Feinstein the equivalent Democrat on the Judiciary Committee has begun her remarks losses last summer they\nEven our dot org you in our public radio abhor by telling your smart speaker to placate you went our time is seven o'clock\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steven Inskeep We are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of\nState Senate to end debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court if he clears that hurdle the final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow senators giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios and who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend final say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this has got to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior member senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\n\nUp okay we're gonna try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear or in their entire already over the next few minutes\nFrom two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had the\nPosed this nomination but everything that they had\nThe other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch to confirmation it is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended\nTo guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes needed Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell Mitch McConnell is not what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they are sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their sides at but don't\nBe fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he\nHas done amazing things for a matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this was true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nAlthough there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to\nDo that and Chuck Schumer you know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is\nThere a guy he's they're pointing it he's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brakkton what's the scene like this morning\nWell Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the date is still young [noise] ah there is a group of speakers that are standing up to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away\nOr they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual faults in national trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying\nWe cannot put a Supreme Court we cannot elevate someone to the Supreme Court who's been accused of such crimes\nHave been founded what what they're saying hits it one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days as well we don't talk about that a little bit more a moment apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary the well\nWas poisoned from the outset when President Trump's selected judge Kavanaugh from a list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest is a ... concern compared to repealing ...\nThis is a trifling concern compared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court\nThe rock worsened when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public just guarding decades of bipartisan precedent and warning norms of transparency and the fairness\nAnd finally the dam broke under the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault in high school in twenty Eighteen the Republican majority conducted the hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings and Nineteen Ninety One look fair by comparison\nIn this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side no independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford on trial [noise]\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a break away members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations\nInvestigation which was then severely circumstance cry by the White House our Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee when future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate's conduct here let them look back on this chapter\nAs the shameful combination of the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America people who will stop at nothing to win trench an advantage on our nation's courts\nLet the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a sorry epilogue to the brazen theft\nOf Justice Scalia's seat the AIG know many aunts and\nA bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices and for what for whom or Senate Republican leaders willing to discard all semblance of fairness to confirm\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh certainly a product of an elite education but also someone with hard right conservative jurisprudence far far away from what average Americans believe\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sideline politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the Senate\nMob can attack and the Senate ...\nAlmost signed up and say that serious\nThoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy on Americans live or will declare that our society cannot and must not\nWell not set the bar so\nLow\nSo modern president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this\nExcellent judge but\nIt's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation\nSo well for so long or on folders for\nStep back and sample a few of the choice moments that the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was announced as the president's choice where are the junior senator from Oregon declare that just nominate would pave the way to turn it\nHis audience crowds of are allowed protesters still filling out in the blanks on they're picking side there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\nAll they're picking sides there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle in which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil or you're fighting against a more recently\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nI'll listen to this\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes\nTo allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\n\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\n\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great coughing offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties\nThat was incredibly enlightening innocent jokes\nBeer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings\nAt play until of course one number of judge Kavanaugh last night set him straight earlier this week we'll stop and consider the snap shots the absurdity the absurdity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were excuses for delay those fell flat\nThere were gross destruction to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside factor first and there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whatever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice ...\n... women hustled vulnerable people hospital workers same old tricks same old playbook but here's the problem the only players weren't working\nThe distortions were being liberated drowned out by the facts\nSenators received and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination than for every previous Supreme Court nomination combined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court three hundred plus\nOpinions were sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts was nothing like the character nothing like the character so it was clear mind president the old taxes weren't working one going to get the job done\nThe resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened next I'm corroborated allegations of the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharpen\nInto political weapons\nInto political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nSomehow mysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly set out on a sober focus search for the truth the community selected testimony organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh FBI investigation\nBy any parents that are the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward no corroborating evidence none not was producers support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiring\nOr from anywhere else nothing\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it by now when the very FBI investigation for which they'd been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats move the goal posts yet again I\nBelieve the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid now let's do this because individuals who had only recently been told\nSecondhand or third hand about nearly forty year old allegations\nWeren't treated as a central witnesses let me say that again the latest story as it the whole investigation\nLet me say that again the latest story is it the whole investigation is invalid\nBecause individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third I Am about nearly forty you're all allegations weren't treated as a central witnesses never mind that they didn't actually witnessed anything\nThey didn't want to say anything\nWell let's be clear madam president these are not witnesses these are people supposedly in possession of here say let's say first heard thirty five years after the suppose fact\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most voted their names are called and there's more normal setting but are these thoughts can drag out again I go back to that he voted to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nVote absolutely and we do see a number of senators at their desk is very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people ... conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely around even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things than I Do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two\nDecades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell yes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year\nOr the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cash that are the magic thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare or this would be the combination for Mitch McConnell of off a lifetime\nReally of campaigning for changed federal judiciary unless you're supposed to listen to a little bit more as that goes through the rules are killers\n[noise] Mr Toomey Mr Udall Mr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote ... Scott Detrow we're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live out the vote is ... is is fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and do you see that's right or you can't have a sperm sent out a final vote goes until they banged the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator home we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference well we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise with ... and ... of the Delaware as he got into Delaware when checked to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nLike investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for ... cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report\nThe Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and it ruins that are that in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at the report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nWas even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench in a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this confirmation process has generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling as is now more or less closed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you weren't listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring in another voice here as we await the final tally the not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex ... has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nHey Steve could be with him\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\n[noise] only thing is going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell\nAnd you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the terms the midterms are barely a month away this is a big way in a big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think we're looking for something\nTo get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy has them gap has a lot of the surveys have shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that you know really narrowed in part because of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have a when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that apparently gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters as ... and that was the challenge for\nTerm elections are all about turning out your voters as ... and that was the challenge for us going into the midterms it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are going to be more amped up then the people\nThat are kind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen the way that the Democrats from Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism Republicans as a whole\nAnd Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to to succeed is just sort of a nail in the coffin in terms of locking down for ... years yet\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because it was probably almost certainly be after the election\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you termed it for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWhile I think the process is the process and in a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee from a Republican perspective we wanted\nWe wanted a ... a a another plenty on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session\nSo I think part of it is driven by the Supreme Court counter part of it is driven by the fact that we don't want to have a nominee just hanging out there indefinitely while the character assassination continues and then yes I Do think part of it is the ... the political factor which is\nThere's an opening on the Supreme Court if we can put another Trump appointee and other ...\nSo I Do think part of it is the the political factor which is there's an opening on the Supreme Court if we can put another Trump appointee another solid\nIn Ninety One point five K. and see the al ... streaming on Ninety K. U. N. R. dot org and on the K you in our public radio at the time is eight o'clock special coverage continues\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where a dramatic vote has just taken place\nIn the U.S Senate in the nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and the west Virginia senator who was the presiding officer today Republicans ah choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this vote the yeas are fifty one that knows are forty nine the notion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that time fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one\nDemocrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate a kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so\nTo vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as\nLong as well as anyone and she is in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving who's covered politics for very long time as well good morning to you both in mourning mourning study thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama the last couple\nOf weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice presuming that Kavanaugh gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court than it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\n[noise] well I was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump picked\nFrom his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man that is being replaced\nAnd that will kill to court that was sort of like a balanced bored sometimes\nMainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way to the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the voters five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win\nAnd they may\nMove on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to\nAnd to um to take on\nLegal questions that have only been sort of um the wish list of hardcore conservatives four fifty\nOf hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nNow it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue the conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would be don't do the heart of even this\nTerm which is so far pretty doggy term frankly with not very compelling big hot sexy cases given this term so far with a half the docket agreed to and the rest yet to come\nThere are three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding precedence so you can see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the left you could be blocked or you could be suddenly find as people are now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question of arbitration\nSaid to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in ... and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that ...\nThat example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights and\nOverturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights and\nAnd and many other things let's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer a the a Democrat from New York when he gave his speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying this nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a so that a minority cannot block\nA action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there'd been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes one of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska another one being Susan Collins of Maine\nWho issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that she spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins of Maine but what you said out to a to a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor is that I'm voting yes\nVoting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later on when I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works ride Ron Elving\nIs but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and why ... why would you do that\nWell the the justification that people put forward is they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't and at the end of that we should\nWe haven't and at the end of that we should be fair enough to this Kennedy to give him a final vote on the floor now I plan to vote no but I think he should have that final vote on the floor\nShe has not said that let's be fair which he didn't believe in and I say that and and I think there'd be an awful lot of folks who'd be very surprised if tomorrow she votes no but she has that option\nShe may I don't think she's actually\nWell who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure that he's on there and I don't know if she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a time when the rules were\nDifferent when that sort of thing would happen you'd get sixty votes for cloture then maybe only fifty two votes to pass\nIn there you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote and win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with a filibuster\nOkay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was a no vote at least on cloture Susan Collins of Maine who was a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her decision on the final vote\nAnd then there was a Republican who was never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the factory verdict of the mob and the media would wet out over the actual\nEvidence made sure the mob prevail\nThey are uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here and there is that it\nWill not have the final say\nAround here\nNot have the final say around here the Senate will have the final so\nThe Senate is not quite had the final say but they got to step closer today with this fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering and then we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now more lately is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly ...\nYou got an excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learn this news at the fifty one forty nine vote to advance Kevin\n[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch as you guys have been talking about a ... there's actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch over the next twenty four hours a and they are the um [noise]\nUh Susan Collins a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock mhm [noise] but uh you know she might be actually trying to\nUh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know ... I'm going to vote no but he deserves to vote that could be possible I think it's likely both ... and the other person is Joe Manchin who\nUh I think Democrats are probably split and whether or not they're surprised a at his vote today a to a his vote for cloture um but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now\nUh if if I were a betting man I Would probably bad for narrow confirmation tomorrow but what those two senators do over the next twenty four hours is going to tell us everything we need to know\nWant to note there are so many layers to this story there is the question of Senate votes there is the broad question of policies that could change laws that could be interpreted or reinterpreted as Nina Totenberg has been discussing and then there's the reality of politics we're deep into an election campaign where it has seen\nThe ticks we're deep into an election campaign where it is seen as possible that one or plausibly although it's a long shot both houses of Congress could flip\nAnd we have mentioned in our live coverage here that there are about ten Democratic senators who were seen as vulnerable representing states that voted for President Trump and now up for reelection\nEureka fifty six degrees bishop Seventy five in Reno sixty seven at the moment it's forty two degrees in Carson City in forty four in Reno in the time is eight twenty\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where we have been listening in the last little while to historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate\nThe vote was fifty one forty nine fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this\nThe Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end the debate\nAnd then the final vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage than they would on ending debate as a matter of fact one Senator Susan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance the nomination but that she would give a different statements sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock\nAs to what her actual vote would be on the floor tomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes\nThat the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote\nFor a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominee even before there were allegations of sexual assault\nAnd then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break in Schumer's word\nIn terms of doubts about this nominee doubts that were reinforced by his harsh and partisan testimony of some of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said\nThey were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine Blasey Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh has a friend\nFriend looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine is the vote and let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican months' NARAL can start us off here in this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything that surprised you are here to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kind of independence she shown over the years this is somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate in ... the the odds of doing that anywhere are nearly impossible now allow much Alaska and well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because it's she's a very well known names and yeah and not as many people as a you know some of the other states\nSo she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't all Republican leadership anything so when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profiling courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought could be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion\nOr because of the politics of\nEither their caucus a with a Collins or of their state with Joe ... and when\nWe say profile in courage were just defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody was high stay\nWell last time that I'm not a sex would suggest that not as a Democrat that pro democratic state I mean that as somebody who would ... going on in their voting rights go against their base so when you think about\nUm what we what we have left though given that Murkowski voted no on cloture it's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor later when it comes to the action\nShe's going to be a no on the floor leader when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with the pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia these three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mentioned\nThanks for reminding us one could peel away and it wouldn't be an art I'd still be fifty votes it'd be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just senators on the floor\nBut protesters outside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters who confronted Jeff Flake in an elevator famously a little more than a week ago there were protesters who confronted Orrin Hatch of Utah\nIn an elevator just yesterday and must listen to some more of the sounds of continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward [noise]\n\nExplicit statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg as we listen to those protests I'm reminded of one of the excruciating conflicts here", "show_name": "Morning Edition
