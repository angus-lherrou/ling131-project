... sat down with Bundy\nI Want to talk to you a little bit about education Nevada has struggled over the years to improve its education system how to use governor improve the uh the the the education system in the state\nWill as bad as the education system seems to be according to our ratings of fifty or fifty is just about anything to do shouldn't approve of it but to my particular ideals or the the\nResponsibility or to educate belongs to the parents doesn't belong to the state north to the phones rubber the state of course can aid the individual parents\nState of course can aid the individual the parents in in in helping with that I see that whatever monies are being allocated to the education students should be placed into the hands of the parents\nAnd they use that their discretion whether they choose to home school son to a private school to a charter school or whatever type of school I Believe that the schools\nShould be taken out of the hands of government and placed in the more privatized I Believe that if the money's were placed in the hands of the parents that new schools would come into existence smaller schools schools perhaps that we're more focused upon a particular line of subject\nUh colleges so to speak the high schools might be more like colleges in the future but I Believe that ah with competition there would be\nAll types of schools that would come into existence that would increase the quality of education\nWhat role does the government plan health care I don't believe the government should have a role in health care why because that's an individual responsibility it's not a government function programs like Medicare Medicaid do you believe that those are not needed or a unconstitutional perhaps\nKnow those are socialistic type programs that I don't necessarily agree with I can see some good they do and I can also see a lot of confusion and harm they cause in the medical industry and I think God I Believe that because of them that medical costs have risen that there's a lot of corruption and\nFraud that takes place because of them but yet I can also\nTakes place because of them but yet I can also see that many people rely on those things for for their help them benefits um it's not something that can be dropped easily or quickly\nBut ah I still believe that medical care is an individual responsibility and people should plan accordingly for their needs\nThe law in Nevada requires that the state perform a background check on certain gun purchases now the current attorney general Adam ... one of your opponents as that that's a forcible others say it's unconstitutional\nUm you know neither here nor there the voters passed that measuring twenty sixteen would you as governor defended what does the Supreme lots of land say I rented the second amendment sure why don't you go and tell me [laughter]\nYou know it says uh the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed mhm hey sodium infringement is a big word in a big meaning\nOkay so if they're a law passed that infringes upon that right then it's it's not a proper law and I believe that the background check is an infringement\nSo you would not defend that particular law well it's an it's an improper law because it's infringing upon a guaranteed right by the Supreme wild land\nYou know the federal government is passed laws to make it illegal for felons to own guns is that on ... unconstitutional\nShirt is I I have to uphold the rule of law of course that Supreme law of the land that is the the rights that people have we have to hold those and and so\nAnd and so some things we've got to go do through legislation some things can be done simply by the executive power\nSo just to ask you know if every man woman and child or in this country wanted to have a gun they have the ability to have forgotten that's right and they should have one\nTelling your smart speakers ... headlines or next it's seven
