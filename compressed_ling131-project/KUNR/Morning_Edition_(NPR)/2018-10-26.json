probe\nJoining us now is NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre yeah Great Hey Noel All right so the government is putting a lot of resources into this investigation at this is not the first type of investigation or investigation of this sort in the countries in recent history what have investigators learned from those those earlier probes\nWell the first of all we know these are relatively rare going all the way back to Nineteen Seventy they've just been fifty seven package bombs and twenty three additional cases of dangerous materials like anthrax or rice than these figures come from the start consortium which studies terrorism at the at the University of Maryland\nBeen fewer than twenty death but one big change some of the cases in the past were very very hard to solve

morning the billionaire George Soros is one of several public figures who've been mailed what are believed to be pipe bombs this week cirrhosis a hedge fund investor and philanthropists who donated to causes many of them progressive around the world\nAnd we should know that the open society foundation which he founded in Nineteen Ninety three has been a financial supporter of NPR\nDoors are as as a lot of enemies in politics he's been a target of conspiracy\nA lot of enemies in politics he's been a target of conspiracy theories from the right\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages well the whole phenomenon\nOf the pipe bombs or business surprises me in a pool of me but um if you were to say that somebody was to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wanted to attack\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important normal politician\nI'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen Seventy two a well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary or so his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation of his country and he survived by separating from his family and I think that trauma explains a lot about it the focus of his finance or in his politics and life\nAnd he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from that he went into finance he moved to New York he opened one of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful\nStock market trader so that by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties and nineties\nTell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\nWell I'm In the nineties a specialty whereas a currency peg than looked unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England couldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark\nThe bank of England couldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark and when services right or the pound collapse are us made enough food for sure and the u._k. economy a descended into chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIt began in his native Hungary and then in other Eastern European countries where his ... he had a clear political papas which was to build for lives and so he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties own words but\nThe switch came in two thousand tree when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War there once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on demographic get out the vote causes that was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick\nIf you are being attacked in the major and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the major is lowering the because of sort of ... and his allies have put them up to it\nWhy does George Soros securely become seen as a shadowy figure hiding and talked to is it just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as Saturday you can't expand it rationally birth actually his for them to be a school the open society Institute He's very open about it he published a figure as a about where the donations go so I think it's hard to escape\nThe suspicion that the critics who say he shot every I'm a ... on a long tradition of anti Semitism where Jewish finance is a portrayed as the shadowy figure to manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's a fairly clear indication of that tradition\nWell what the people in his native hungry thinkers Soros\n[noise] he was a hero early on in the transition away from communism things have turned\nHere are early on in the transition away from communism and it's a ton more recently because of the anti immigration populist nationalism that is taking over the country\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of several books and a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations thank you so much thank you\nPresident Trump is headed to Charlotte North Carolina today to rally supporters for Republican congressional candidate mark Harris\nHarris is caught in a tight race in a former Republican strongholds against Democrat Dan McCready NPR's Kelsey Snell has more on how major shifts in North Carolina politics mirror changes across America\nFor more than fifty years voters in the ninth congressional district in North Carolina have been sending Republicans to Congress but things are changing\nThis year Harris a conservative Baptist minister is slipping in the polls behind mccready a Democrat and former marine David a Clinton a professor of political science at ... college says the Trump rally is a sign that Republicans have to fight harder than there used to\nThe fact that President Trump is coming from a farm or they still see that raises winnable it would have been feasible two decades ago for a Republican president to me become in progress district\nNick Clinton said because of shifting demographics people from other states and other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham and Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it too he sounds like the rest of America Democrats in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you go\nYou look at the political fine for them and you can almost see other county law and the shift between the Democratic sons are on one side of the county line and you're moving to another county more rural county and all of a sudden that strong country\nThe line isn't so clear in other\nMore rural county and all of a sudden it's Trump country\nThe line isn't so clear in other areas like Polk County where the view of the political trend line depends on who you ask county commissioner ray gas ... says the area is about sixty percent Republican but he's the only elected Democrat\nAnd when he sees his party dominating in statewide offices in the future that doesn't mean the entire state is turning blue\nWearable hundred counties and at least eighty percent or ... rule which for him to go much more Republican\nWell county Republican chairman diction honesty says rural Republican voters like Trump\nI'm seeing a trend where there's a movement away from the Democratic party to the Republican Party just because there is a

Today show anchor Megan Kelly caused outrage with some on air remarks about Halloween costumes\nIt was a controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and I felt like who doesn't want to and she wants to look like Diane around for one day I I don't know how like that got races on hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show line up and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it just is white and she says it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\nWill these aren't uh the only examples of of their number I remember back in twenty eight and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claimed that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny he'd group black hate group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal a strategist for about ten minutes who she felt was feeling to take it a sufficiently seriously uh one more example uh\nFeeling to take it a sufficiently seriously or one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA a homicide detective mark ... farm in on the air to about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about uh the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial ah many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed among show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah which he felt was the acceptability of blackface\nNBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something and making Kelly's colleague an attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which is\nReally interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a Sheikh accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing her I also think you can't divorce it from the ...\nFox News of sexually harassing her I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News you just play some popular colleagues\nAnd that whole ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she's been discussing with a network another role there uh because uh she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her eggs that as well\nNPR's David Folkenflik Thanks David you bet Mm\nIt's friday and time

pipe bombs\nFigures who've been mailed what are believed to be pipe bombs this week cirrhosis a hedge fund investor and philanthropist who donated to causes many of them progressive around the world and we should note that the open society foundation which he founded in Nineteen Ninety three has been a financial supporter of NPR\nDoors are as as a lot of enemies in politics he's been a target of conspiracy theories from the right\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nWell the whole phenomenon of the pipe bomb or business surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that somebody was are to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wanted to attack\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important normal politician\nI'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen thirty to a well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary a set of his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation in this country and he survived by separating from his family and I think that ... explains a lot about the focus of his financial in his politics and life\nAnd he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from that he went into finance he moved to New York he opened one of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful stock market trader so that by around Nineteen eighty\nHe was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he

briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\n[noise] well I'm In the nineties a specialty whereas a currency peg than looked unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England couldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark\nAnd weren't services right or the pound collapse or us made enough food for sure and the u._k. economy a descended into chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIt again in his native Hungary and then and other Eastern European countries where his finance ... he had a clear political confidence which was to build our lives and so he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties own words but\nThe switch came in two thousand three when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War there once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on democratic get out the vote causes that was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick\nIf you were being attacked in the major and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the major is lowering the because of sort of ... and his allies have put them up to it\nWhy does George Soros some peculiar become seen as a shadowy figure hiding in talked isn't just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as a shadowy you can't expand it rationally because actually his finance or B is called the open society Institute He's very open about it he published a figure as a about where the donations go so I think it's hard to escape the suspicion that the critics who say he ...\nI'm a natural ring on a long tradition of anti Semitism\nCritics say he shot every I'm a ... on a long tradition of anti Semitism where Drew's finances are\nPortrayed as the shutter if it goes through manipulate the politicians and so forth I think it's a pretty good indication of that tradition\nWell

in Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it too he sounds like the rest of America Democrats in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you go\nYou look at the political fine but I mean you can almost see other county law and the shift between the Democratic signs were on one side of the county line and you're moving to another county more rural

him recovered it in South Florida the bulk of this investigation seems to be centered in two places though one is the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia which is analyzing these devices may look like homemade pipe bombs and the experts at the FBI will be looking for clues\nHow the bombs were constructed there'll be looking for DNA are fingerprints\nThe bomber bombers may have the left behind and retired investigators are telling me this is very promising because so many of these devices are intact they didn't blow up if history as a guide though the whole process could take a little while

week NBC's Today show anchor Megan Kelly caused outrage with some on air remarks about Halloween costumes it was a controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she is Diana\nIt was it was a controversy on the outside of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and who doesn't want to and she wants to look like I Am around her one day I I don't know how like that that raises not hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all you can watch at home than it and just as white Jesus was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comment\nWill these aren't uh the only examples of that there are number I remember back in twenty and the CNN Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last\nYear claim that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group ... group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal strategist for about ten minutes who she felt was feeling to take it\nA sufficiently seriously uh one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective ... on the air to talk about a ... a criminal justice issues and to talk about uh the question of a African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things\nOver the years during the OJ trial um many\nSaid racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited things she welcomed them on the show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's The colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged who her remarks about ah which he felt was the acceptability a blackface\nNBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole thing about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something of that and making Kelly's colleague an attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news\nWhich is really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger about\nThe way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News she just play some popular collies\nAnd that her reading some cells were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she'd been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show is gone and she's a negotiating her eggs that as well\nThat show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her eggs as well NPR's David Folkenflik thanks to you but

New Jersey senator Cory Booker the other two former director of national intelligence James Clapper NPR's national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following this fast moving story I carry hire new well so what do we know that the person now in custody\nWell not much a law enforcement source tells me it is a man based in Florida we don't yet know his name or his background or importantly whether he acted alone we also have to know whether this person was motivated by politics are personal reasons or some other reason\nThe Justice Department says it's going to hold a news conference at two thirty pm eastern time to provide more details on this unfolding case only this morning investigators found a package addressed a former intelligence chief James Clapper in New York and also disclose that they had found a package in Florida address to New Jersey senator Cory Booker\nWell a lot of attention in this case it focused on Florida overnight a local police their search to mail facility what were they looking for\nLast night authorities were searching a package sorting facility in Florida in ... near Miami the operating fury with some of the packages went through that facility and through the u._s. mail\nThey were looking for more devices but also any other clues and local TV in Florida is now beaming images of a strong law enforcement presence in plantation Florida at a site that appears to be connected to the suspect in federal custody a lot of manpower has been deployed nationwide though the postal inspectors\nThe FBI the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives have been on the case as well as local police I'm\nIn the Miami Dade County area and also of course the New York city police department to\nAnd there's also some ongoing

analyzing some of these devices\nWhich look like homemade pipe bombs they've been looking for clues for how the bombs were constructed and they've also been looking for DNA or fingerprints the bomber may have left behind no word yet on whether anything they've found in that analysis has helped lead them to the suspect in South Florida\nOh that's interesting we'll have to wait and see I suppose so I mean one notable thing this whole time is that none of these bombs that actually exploded and so there's been some speculation that maybe they couldn't explode they didn't have the capacity what investigators said about that theory\nOn the record police sources and the FBI are declining to answer questions about whether the these bombs could it presented a lethal threat to anyone on background overnight in earlier this morning I was hearing\nA law enforcement was inclined to think they did not present a lethal threat there could be a reason for that some former bomb analyst at the ATF has raised questions about whether these devices included a key component that would have set them off that would have detonated that made it appeared from the photos that were made public that perhaps\nThese devices lacked that key component\nBut nonetheless police had been advising folks as had the FBI to be very careful when they were looking at any manila envelopes or any suspicious packages because they needed to be considered a potential threat\nAnd they law enforcement right now even is advising people to call authorities call police called the FBI facing anything suspicious now we know that the New York police commissioner James O'Neill son last last afternoon\nThat the device they've recovered in New York that was addressed to the actor Robert Deniro did not pose a biological threat to not contain anthrax or any ...\nDid not pose a biological threat to not um contain anthrax or any material like that\nBut that authorities were still treating all of these parcels as potentially dangerous and the analysis may not be done yet as to what's in all of these uh these bombs potential out so law enforcement officials still have a long way to go here\nAnd PR is justice
