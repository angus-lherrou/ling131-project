prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's our conversation with rich more\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem\nWhen I realized he was stealing from me\nI first I was thinking hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied but it got to the point where he had me good night and then with one hand going by per se you know well I you know as I was reading in bed you know it was very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on\nWas there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account\nUm while you're while taking his grandfather my father yeah because I was the executive tricks of that or\nThe state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just going full bore\nSo she ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right yes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had lived ... for short period of time\nAnd he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best help would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for

and he would have nobody\nIt was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told them are of that and he cried and I think maybe that planted that seed because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program [noise]\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies health fees gained thirty pounds\nHe looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now it's a it's a

but as you think about voting\nHow would this experience effect you're thinking about the choices that you make\nThere are so many programs that are out there but not everyone can afford it and why did my son have to go back to Baltimore to get that\nMy home state of Florida why didn't we not have the ability to get the help\nOur candidates talking about this issue in Florida\nNo they're not right now we're so polarized for ...

against him the Russia investigation all that stuff is really far afield to\n[noise] actually I voted for President Trump did you I did not like the way the country was going and I wanted to make a
