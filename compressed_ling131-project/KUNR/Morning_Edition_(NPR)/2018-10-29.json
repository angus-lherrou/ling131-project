four months\nIt was itchy and like read the like poison\nShe made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the skin cream she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to live bomb neo spore and\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test bans are pain\nCall a phony um they tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement usually found in beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol they put ... into a tiny plastic capsule then they drew a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nOut Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to

thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patients being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of

money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah [laughter] you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nNo the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nCompete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally\nFor references Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health coverage comes from

first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about but he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and the union for the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why both not a defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insist the survival of the democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to report has about the need for the future presidents\nAnd to reporters about the need for the future president to respect to the judge had to remind him and and people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's essentially shoe but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and how the fed the remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes oh they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in ...\nHe's rainy on that he's going to do a good job\nI don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he really but\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him is his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that does have a game plan to do that when\nHe wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high murder rate yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a than a quarter a senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder or a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than men\nMost of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks You're welcome\nNow we have more of a social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking into the tree of life synagogue with for weapons Robert Bowers apparently got fired up with words he reportedly used gab which calls itself an alternative to Twitter and its popular among the far right Here's NPR's Jasmine Garsd\nGap is a site that proudly promotes free speech and posted it lets anyone say anything but it's been controversial critics have called it a home for anti Semite and white nationalist\nRobert Bowers was a user before allegedly going on a killing spree he posted about the Hebrew immigrant aid society\nA group that supports refugees he said the group quote likes to bring invaders that kill our people I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics ongoing in Andrew torn about is the CEO of gab in an interview with NPR he defended the platform\nI I don't know you see a direct threat in there\nAnd I don't what what would you expect it to do with those like that where you you you want us to just venture anybody that's been afraid I'm going in that what you're proposing here well I run again I'm very ... and here's the thing he answered the bad feet or hate speech however you want to define that\nIs more speech and always will be\nWhen this online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light the man accused of sending explosive devices to ...\nTo light that the men accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats in the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour but says gab follows strict rules including no threats she says she created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nOn earth thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Ronald Trump\nExpressing hate for white people towards Christian towards minorities who may on now keep weren't Donald Trump a bailout hate to be spewed at certain groups and certain people\nSo where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nI think the line as we're free speech become a threat\nKelly McBride is a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says poor by is prioritizing free speech above all other constitutional values\nAnd that is not necessarily what our constitutional famers intended right they didn't want the government curbing free speech\nNor did they want citizens to be responsible with their speech she says last year Google band jobs up apple rejected and Microsoft terminated its agreement with it last month\nJust in the last twenty four hours at least two Web hosting platforms have suspended gab CEO Andrew ... is not\nBacking down we're not going anywhere ... says gab\nCondemns the shooting but he thinks it's now being targeted unfairly over the weekend the social media site was filled with anger some of it

came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back\nI didn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had

choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the math just doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of this entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano oh and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'll be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple\nSo ... we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive through Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test at\nA sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it there is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was part of\nThe reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospitals systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means\n... says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy tests\nOh how could expense who could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area\nI mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally\nFor references\nDr Elisabeth

right [noise]\n\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro the continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves who was reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and the union for the restoration of national pride\nI don't think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to report is about the need for the future presidents who respects to judge had to remind him and the people the people\nTo respect to the judge had to remind him and and people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and how the fed the remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes oh they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not at home in ...\nHe's rainy on as he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David off sick of robberies and the sky high murder rate yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a than a cold or senior last night which is a Sperling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... power to a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both

they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total

and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'll be worth it for a lobby the fitting a five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting

can produce such an expensive to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a buck forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [noise]\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it there's much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was part of\nThe reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place\nTo live well no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurance look at what's usual and customary so if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and\nAsk what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expense who could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test\nIs normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally\nFor references Dr
