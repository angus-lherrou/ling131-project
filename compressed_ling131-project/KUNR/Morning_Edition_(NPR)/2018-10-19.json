important to me I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here so that we can have the freedom to have different views to have these kind of conversation 'cause they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother them because we have that freedom that's why my parents left Vietnam to be

discriminate against I I think my parents have that because it really they their lives or hear their communities here they go to the ... they go to their customers are ... or ... are diverse now I realize my experience as an American very different from my dad\nAnd these generational differences extend into politics older Vietnamese Americans have tended to vote Republican many of them fled

haven't talked about that so is this the first one yeah and I have a surprise but then I'll have a conversation about the other stuff that he does against the media\nAgainst like just civil society we grow up knowing how undemocratic Vietnam is the crackdowns on freedom of the press on basic human rights\nWomen don't have the same rights there and to see some of that happening now in America you know and some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine\nWe will be in a situation where we have a president basically calling to press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam but we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be reality here today\nCould you say that your daughter yeah I'm just I just wonder

seem to be happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one person\nI clearly him strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important to me I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here so that we can have the freedom to have different views to have this kind of conversation said they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom that's why my parents left Vietnam to be

province\nThe voting has been postponed that are run attack that left to senior officials dead including a top police chief\nPamela constable covers Afghanistan for the Washington Post and she's on the line mark on the program\nI'm Glad to be with you\nI guess we should figure out what was supposed to happen this weekend what is the original plan what's at stake and what's the campaigning bin Laden\n[noise] um the original plan was to have um a\nVery big nationwide election more than two thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament candidates of all all flavors and philosophies\nAh there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of concern and worry\nPartly because of threats by the column on which has now come true awe and partly widespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be massive fraud though you've seen a lot of a positive uh campaigning lot of new fresh faces a lot of enthusiasm but also a great deal of\nOf worry a A N and an anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting that in Kandahar Province of really large an important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise a question what is possibly going to be any different in a week\nRight and we don't know that obviously this is a measure taken on an emergency basis um just to to sort of calm things down in Kandahar for very large province which is tough loss\nThey measure taken on an emergency basis\nUm just to to sort of calm things down and kind of hard to very large province which is tough lost its police chief its intelligence chief and the governor has been gravely wounded um there's a huge security vacuum people are very nervous and worried so I think that there's obviously a measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously decision will be made later on I I Would think and hope that that elections can be held there because it's a favorite populist lots and lots of voters\nBut

discriminate against I I think my parents haven't because really they have their lives or hear their communities here they go to a Vietnamese now they go to their customers are meeting these are our ... our diverse now I ...\nThey go to their customers are meeting these are our ... our diverse now I realize my experience as an American very different from my dad\nAnd these generational differences extend into politics older Vietnamese Americans have tended to vote Republican many of them fled communism and they see Republican presidents from Reagan on as being tougher on communist leaders some younger people like TNN Tom Tran have been leaning more democratic and that is one reason\nThe party believe they can unseat the Republican incumbent here\nSo when we went to visit the ... we had heard there were some political differences in her family though I'm not sure she herself new quite how stark they were\nHigh high\nShe invited us into her parents' home her kids were playing around they were eating snacks and they were orbiting around the grandfather [noise] how Tran is ... father he primarily speak Vietnamese and his everyday life including when he talks politics

is um I open it [laughter] [laughter]\nI didn't realize how he he thought of Trump 'cause we haven't talked about that is the first time yeah and I have a surprise because then I'll have a conversation about the other stuff that he does against the media\nAgainst like just civil society we grow up knowing how undemocratic Vietnam is the crackdowns on freedom of the press on basic human rights\nWomen don't have the same rights there and to see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine we would be in a situation where we have a president\nBasically calling to press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam but we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be reality here today\nCould you say that you do them yeah I'm just I just wonder why when Trump calls the media enemy of the people what your reaction to that\nMenu ally like all gold gold and yelled out you know none of them\nAre from time to for us to talk about what these changes but they don't care about the food and you're just has to CNN or didn't drum riff off for both

lot of families who've been divided over their views Trump what is your dinner conversations that yeah the go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one person\nI clearly am strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important to me I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here so that we can have the freedom to have different views to have these kind of conversation because they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom that's why my parents' lead Vietnam to be here in the first place\nEverybody got to go to vote yes you both for tours and for future the weird thing to think everybody should vote yeah\nAnd my father I didn't mention any he oh after the war
