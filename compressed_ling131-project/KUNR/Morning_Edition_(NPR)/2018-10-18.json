US Senate race is among them most closely watched election in the nation's the to break down the race between incumbent Republican senator Dean Heller and his challenger democratic congresswoman Jackie rose and he ... news director Michel ... sat down with our senior political reporter Paul\n... news directing Michele Kelemen sat down with our senior political reporter poker\nHall thanks for joining me so much for the nature of this Senate race between Halloran brothers and it's it's garnering a lot of attention now why is everyone watching rain\nThe main reason is that Democrats see that they have a fairly decent shot at taking control the Senate and the best way to do that is by an sitting Dean Heller\nHow was the only Republican up for reelection this year in a state that Hillary Clinton won in twenty sixteen he's been widely seen as the most vulnerable GOP senator in the country and to be honest his full throated supporter of president Donald Trump's agenda\nHas not made him a lot of friends in places like Clark County which is heavily democratic devout is also true battleground state now in twenty fourteen but I don't want all red and twenty sixteen it went all blue this year who knows point in the state isn't it tore asleep at\nThe polling we do have shows that it's a very tight race in Egypt don't get that in many places around the country\nWe've heard a lot about health care and this year I'm can we actually stopping just break that down a little bit uh what is actually at stake in the health care debate in this election\nI think if you talk to Democrats they'd tell you that everything is at stake in the health care debate now ... and boy have they made that their campaign issue this year the Democrats have use everything at their disposal to criticize Dean Heller for his flip flopping on a series of votes last year\nUh looking to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act to be fair I think it's important if we if we rehash a little bit of history during that so the debates last year however voted against straight up repeal effort\nOr ... as a matter of fact you might have seen ads with him standing next to the governor Brian Sandoval\nYou might have seen ads with him standing next to governor Brian Sandoval talking about his opposition to repeal effort at that point the biggest point of contention with her appeal process was that it would effectively ended Medicaid expansion here in Nevada\nBut when the Medicaid expansion aspect of that program was removed from the repeal effort\nHow I became much more amenable to a piece of legislation you may remember called the skinny repeal it ultimately failed but how we are supported it he also supported the tax cut bill passed by Congress later that year which actually ended the individual mandate\nNow that's a lot to follow and it's not easy to unpack all of it in a single thirty second ad\nBut Rosen has been tacking how we are on the issue for months to combat that however is doing his best to alert voters to his efforts to save one of those popular portions of the health care law requiring insurance companies continue to cover pre existing conditions\nAnd what are some of the major issues that are facing in that\nYeah so health care is taking the spotlight there are your typical issue debate that seemed to always come up\nImmigration is one of them however has voiced support for immigration reform but I have not gotten into too many specifics\n... and rose and has been highly critical the administration's policy on the budget ... voted for the massive tax cuts last year\nBut also criticized lawmakers Washington for spending too much Rosen has characterized the cuts as a massive give away for the rich on his website Heller says the he has oppose efforts by quote unquote the extreme left in Congress to limit law abiding citizens the right to bear arms\nRosen has actually called for increased gun control in the past\nHe says those have been a particularly negative race between erupts\nThis has also been a particularly negative race between Republicans and the Democrats why has it taken that negative town\nYeah if you open your mailbox watched TV for more than five minutes watching online video in the last month or two\nYou have very likely been inundated with campaign material and it's particularly bad for non partisans here in the state and for part of the reason for that is all the money that's been pouring in last quarter July to September Jacky Rosen was able to raise more than seven million dollars\nNow how are

Indus challenger democratic congresswoman Jackie rose any he when our news director Michel Gilman sat down with our senior political reporter Paul Bulger\nPaul thanks for joining me so let's talk about the nature of this Senate race between Halloran rose and it's it's garnering a lot of attention why is everyone watching this race\nThe main reason is that Democrats see that they have a fairly decent shot at taking control the Senate and the best way to do that is by an sitting Dean Heller\nHow was the only Republican up for reelection this year in a state that Hillary Clinton won in twenty sixteen he's been widely seen as the most vulnerable GOP senator and the country and to be honest has full throated supporter of president Donald Trump's agenda\nHas not made him a lot of friends in places like Clark County which is heavily democratic about is also true battleground state now in twenty fourteen but I don't want all red and twenty sixteen it went all blue\nThis year who knows point in the state is notoriously bad but what point do we do have shows that it's a very tight race and you just don't get that in many places around the country\nWe've heard a lot about health care this year I'm can we actually stop and just break that down a little bit of what is actually at stake in the health care debate in this election\nI think if you're talking to Democrats they tell you that everything is at stake in the health care debate now ... and boy have they made that their campaign issue this year Democrats have use everything at their disposal the courts\nDemocrats have use everything at their disposal to criticize Dean Heller for his flip flopping on a series of votes last year uh looking to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act to be fair I think it's important if we if we rehash a little bit of history during that set a debate last year however voted against straight up repeal effort\nOr ... as a matter of fact you might have seen ads with him standing next to governor Brian Sandoval talking about his opposition to repeal effort at that point the biggest point of contention with her appeal process was that it would effectively ended Medicaid expansion hearing about it\nBut when the Medicaid expansion aspect of that program was removed from the repeal effort\nHowever became much more amenable to a piece of legislation you may remember called the skinny repeal it ultimately failed but Heller supported it he also supported the tax cut bill passed by Congress later that year which actually ended the individual mandate\nNow that's a lot to follow and it's not easy to unpack all of it in a single thirty second ad\nBut Rosen has been tacking how we're on the issue for months to combat that however is doing his best to emerge voters to his efforts to save one of those popular portions of the health care law requiring insurance companies continue to cover pre existing conditions\nAnd what are some of the major issues that are facing in that\nYeah so well health care is taking the spotlight there all your typical issued debate that seemed to always come up\nImmigration is one of them however has voiced support for immigration reform but I have not gotten into too many specifics ... and rose and has been highly critical the administration's policies on the budget Howard has voted for the massive tax cuts last year but also criticized lawmakers Washington for spending too much\nWashington for spending too much Rosen has characterized the cut the mass of give away for the rich on his website Heller says that he has oppose efforts by quote unquote the extreme left in Congress to limit law abiding citizens the right to bear arms Rosen has actually called Fort increase gun control in the past\nHe says those have been a particularly negative race between Republicans and the Democrats why has it taken back negative town\nYeah if you open your mailbox watch TV for more than five minutes watching online video in the last month or two you have very likely been inundated with campaign materials and it's particularly bad for nonpartisan here in the state and for part of the reason for that is all the money that's been pouring in\nLast quarter and a lot of September Jacky Rosen was able to raise more than seven million dollars", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Reno", "day": "18"}
