good morning the u._s. stock market looks ready to recover some of yesterday's dramatic losses when Wall Street opens this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei hangs saying but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because\nChina stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nYou more into our thirty percent drop for China's stock markets sounds pretty darn bad what's going on [noise]\nJohn is calling me has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt Sparling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nSparling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble and through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like if the dog the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is editor weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well it's interesting hearing well is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make experts cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to

and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to MIT is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting and go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch we want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause he's a

call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nIs watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem

Nevada to increase the state's renewable portfolio standards to fifty percent by the year twenty thirty are senior political reporter Paul do gr sat down with students reporter Paolo chef at us to discuss the details of the ballot initiative\nPoets just jump right in what is a renewable portfolio standard so renewable portfolio standards are a pretty complex concept to wrap your head around there's actually a journalist in this state or he's Riley Snyder he works for the Nevada independent and he's worked a lot with complex energy issues like this or he can probably explain it better than I can\nSo in our area is basically a a credit managed system for more to kind of like a cap and trade program where uh\nSo in our area is basically a a credit managed system similar to kind of like a cap and trade program where a honorable energy production has given up certain credit and the state requires that electric utilities to the end of the energy\nUm obtain a certain amount of credits as a percentage of the energy they generate every year basically it's just a a measuring stick a or noble energy production\nSo what's the history of Nevada for renewable portfolio standards you know what are they looked like\nNevada RPGs was established in Nineteen Ninety seven the original goal was six percent which was pretty attainable\nIn fact it was so easy that they more than doubled that goal to Fifteen Percent in two thousand and one lawmakers last amended the RPGs in two thousand nine which required energy providers do supply twenty five percent of their energy from renewable energy sources by twenty twenty five\nYou mention them for two thousand nine was the last time lawmakers made a change has there been any other effort to increase that are PS since then\nYeah actually in two thousand Seventeen to state legislature sent a bill to governor Sandoval\nWhich would have increased their requirements to forty percent by twenty thirty\nSanibel actually vetoed that bill saying it was pretty much are due to the fact that they might be deregulating the energy market\nReferring to question three which is also on the ballot who are in the major supporters of questions six so the question actually originated out of Tom stiers camp he's a big democratic donor based out of California you actually founded the organization that proposed this initiative along the same lines congresswoman Dena Titus is one of the major democratic supporters\nAcross party lines former Republican state senator and current Nevada gaming commission member Randall talents and has also voiced his support of the question\nWhat is there any opposition to questions six I haven't seen a whole lot of\nBut is there any opposition to questions six I haven't seen a whole lot of news on this at least at this point\nYeah there's actually a small group that calls for themselves the coalition of energy users are there in opposition to keepsakes they have a number of high profile Nevada and Republicans attached to this campaign like into the wrong connect\nAnd state senator Don stepson while they have a website a group of members and the name they've yet to make any contributions are expenditures for ads opposing ...\nWhat does questions six relationship with questions three they're both about energy they're both on the ballot this this election you know are they related or they completely separate\nQuestion three would essentially deregulate the energy market prohibiting electrical utilities namely envy energy from establishing monopolies\nCue three has been painted asking ... by state Democrats like gubernatorial candidate Steve's is alive\nCongresswoman Dena Titus they both express their concern that cute three would undermine and in danger in Nevada as clean energy future on the other hand backers of cute three argue that raising renewable portfolio standards would place unnecessary regulations on upcoming energy providers which would slow their Ruth\nIf both questions pass which is a possibility\nIt'll be interesting to see how they interact with each other\nOr the supporters of questions six people who've back to place on the ballot or they at all concerned that there's going to be confusion over between questions fixing question three\nI think there's definitely a concern I have seen a lot of people go out there and talk about the differences between cute three and queue six mainly because they're both energy initiatives so it'll be interesting to see how voters reactors\nThat was K. you when I was ...\nIt'll be

anti abortion rights groups students for life is a former evangelical who converted to Catholicism she says she's heard this argument before and doesn't think most conservative Christian voters will buy it because of how they view abortion\nThere are certainly a lot of issues that Christian care about when they go to vote by the end of the day we know that there is a human rights atrocity

I'm from New Orleans Louisiana how did the U.S views Saudi Arabia before oil was the thing thank you\nThere was no view before oil was a thing a Saudi Arabia as we know it was became a country in Nineteen thirty to the very next year and signed an agreement with standard oil of California to form aramco the Arabian American oil company which is now owned by the Saudi state\nAnd that happened even before it was clear how oil rich the country would be\nThe leader for a unified the country and started the relationship with the U.S was Abdul Aziz evens out he had forty five sons Steve and all the king's since his death in Nineteen fifty three of them one of those sons the crown prince\nFifty three of them one of those sons the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman we've been hearing so much about lately would be the first of the next generation if he becomes king\nThe next question is whether us being so close to the Saudis can get them to do anything\nI this is Alan south from Upton, Massachusetts how much influence does the United states have over Saudi Arabia's foreign policy\nWell I'd say the question is more how much the U.S has chosen to exert a the biggest case in point at the moment is the civil war in Yemen where the Saudis have been accused of bombing civilians and closing off access to a humanitarian aid so that now there's an enormous food crisis taking place\nBut because Iran is involved with the facts and the Saudis are fighting the United states side of the Saudis\nBut there's ... and Congress which showed up in the last defense bill of trying to protect civilians\nAnd there's talk of sanctioning Saudi Arabia in some way because of the journalist killing as well Cokie thanks as always good to talk to stay in commentator Cokie Roberts you can ask Cokie your questions about our politics and government work by emailing us at ask Cokie at NPR dot org or tweeting us with the hashtag askcokie [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nWith Venus lack of affordable housing the downtown motel to become a safety net for families and minimum wage workers on the brink\nThere's people who've lived here that have worked at Tesla there's people who live here who go to work every day\nOnline at K.

day yesterday the Dow was trading up about point eight percent this hour\nBut I don't think the market volatility we've been seeing in the past couple of weeks is not over NPR's Yuki Noguchi joins us now to discuss some of these markets swings can morning ... good morning oh All right so it has been a choppy October yesterday markets closed down and the Dow innocent pie basically erased all their gains for the year what has been going on\nIt's because investors are conflicted and one of their biggest\nIt's because investors are conflicted and one of their biggest underlying concerns is the global economy you know how the trade war will play out and how higher terrorists might effects it might affect U.S companies um you're starting to see some of that already a\nCaterpillar which makes farm equipment and three M which is a huge conglomerate that makes everything from sponges to car parts\nAh this we talked about how that's starting to affect their bottom line now on the plus side the economy and labor market are and\nHave been chugging along so there are no clear indications that that's going to hit a wall or some companies are beating expectations and although interest rates are heading up there still historically low\nAll right so some good factors some bad factors one of those sectors that's been hardest hit in recent days is the tech sector yesterday the NASDAQ which is made up of a lot of tech stocks I had one of the worst days in seven years and this morning we should say it is trading up but what is going on in the technology sector\n[noise] ... well the technology sector has been on an even steadier and stronger Bull Run in recent years I'm apple this summer a you might recall became the first company to reach a trillion dollars and market value so basically ... tech stocks have already risen very high end of a lot\nFurther to fall a and when you have a ... few companies talking as you saw this week about week sales or miss profits\nUm that makes investors nervous that perhaps those stocks are overvalued and you know tech is a great example actually of how the volatility kind of spreads around the world yesterday you had some us tech firms including Texas Instruments and AT and T. reporting some weaker earnings which then prompted you\nEighteen T reporting some weaker earnings which then prompted you Asian tech stocks including Sony and Sampson to fall overnight\nBut then by the morning you had stronger results out of European tech firms in some U.S companies including Microsoft Twitter this morning and that's helping shore up some of those losses so it kind of good contagion they're eating nerve wracking though to see the markets lose like six hundred points in a day\nAnd analysts say this could continue for a while really quickly why is that\nIt's largely because we don't have clarity on some of the questions that I outlined at the outset where's the global economy had it how much of a trade war is going to affect companies um\nAnd until investors feel they have a clearer picture on that you are likely to see strong reactions to any kind of news that could be interpreted as a significant development and we'll get another chance a later today with Amazon and Google's alphabet reporting their earnings NPR's Yuki Noguchi thanks so much thinking well\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes block chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station ... has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in

awareness about blocking [noise] so what is it\nA lot chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology [noise] okay [noise]\nThey give it like the ... is like an accounting book everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but instead on the computers of everyone on the block chain\nTransparency is its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block chain to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... is a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment and then the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just\nMeaning the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution\nThat things that fix climate change are going to be really hard\nLike getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute because it before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nIs watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine rock and a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something that's helpful\nWith a clock ticking on climate change ... there's no time to waste sorting facts from high\nThis is NPR News\nThe Democratic nominee for governor in Illinois has contributed more money to his own campaign any

Jones of the public religion research Institute says moving white evangelicals away from the GOP would be an uphill battle\nYeah once you have several generations that are voting eighty percent Republican I'm it's less that they're doing that because of one particular issue and more than it has become in many ways a kind of tribal identity that's just inextricably tied to evangelical
