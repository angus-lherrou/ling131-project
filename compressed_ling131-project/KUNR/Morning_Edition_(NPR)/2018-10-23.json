when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that is slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focused building up their badge\nNo I don't think I Would criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that\nThe degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen [noise]\nWell we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen\nThe governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen and who will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one state legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have on twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a little over thirty million dollars and we are distributing um the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting land so governors always matter\nA state legislators matter but in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter so in North Carolina we're supporting an IED or else\nWho is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who won a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat\nArgue campaigning for judges who are

like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you look at the the the laws as they had been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitutions as as they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally a ... and I think ensure a a fair process\nOne other thing attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made which you ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama\nKnew when they go low [noise] they go low\nWe you know what did you mean or what I

people like that all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protests through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate [noise] well\nI certainly think votes through protests um I I just say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in

quote\nObama railed against the GOP tax cut efforts to repeal his signature health care law trumps attacks from the media political pressure that the president put on us attorney general Jeff Sessions and the separation of immigrant families of the U.S Mexico border\nObama called this year's elections more important than any in his lifetime including two thousand eight and twenty twelve when he himself was on the ballot\n... kill you in our news\nAbout a voter's may soon decide whether to nix the sales tax on feminine hygiene products can you when ours on gray has more\nValid question to pass through the Nevada Legislature and twenty Seventeen essentially the measure would repeal what's called the pink tax eliminating the sales tax on tampons and sanitary napkins\nTo become law and must now pass through a voter referendum passion as tall as a political science professor at Truckee Meadows community college she says proponents center legislation argue that hygiene supplies aren't luxury items that should be taxed\nThese are not products that women can live without so for example we don't tax food obviously people need food they have to eat they need nurses made these a product that women need as well so to put that tax on they're really kind of puts them at a burden when it comes to taking care of things that they need\nBut opponents of the measure disagree haw says that they're concerned it would shrink the tax\nDegree haw says that they're concerned it would shrink the tax base\nAnd this is with anytime you talk about eliminating a tax on any good or any product it will mean less money at the end of the day and our reserves and then you always have the question of fairness both we cut back on this particular product and we lose money how are we going to make up for that how are we going to shoulder the burden for that\nAccording to the fiscal note on the measure the financial impact on state could be between Seventy two and one hundred and four million dollars annually several states have moved to repeal taxes on them and hygiene products\nA few others including Nevada have pending legislation this year that could do the same on grey for K. you in

knows about the murder of a journalist but Roger ... has poured definite accusations on the record to the\nIRS addressing a meeting of his ruling party he's been talking of the death of ...\nHe's been talking of the death of ... show she walked into a Saudi consulate in Turkey on October second and never emerged\nEveryone says this death was a premeditated killing by Saudi Arabia ... native nation which his writings criticized the Saudi Government first said it knew nothing of his disappearance and then said ... died in a fight and that it is still investigating\nNPR's Peter Kenyon joins us from Istanbul Hi there Peter ... so what evidence is there to put on the table\nWell he says the evidence that they have so far I strongly suggest that this was a planned operation basically dismissing the Saudis story that it was an accident\nOr one new thing that he said uh is that part of the evidence that they have is that the Saudi team that showed up in advance of the killing scouting out some areas possibly for disposal of a body including a forest in North east ... uh and then he also or in his remarks called Henri odd\nOr to allow the Eighteen people they've arrested in connection with the show these death to be prosecuted in Turkey or they have all gone back to Riyadh or Saudi Arabia so they would have to be extradited\nAnd the Turkish president also says this evidence they've got so far raises big questions including on whose orders was this killing carried out why there's such a delay and allowing the consulate and other properties to be searched\nAnd why does the Saudi explanation of what happened changed so many times so it at all points to the fundamental question was at a rogue operation is Riyad suggests or was the leadership and\nOkay so some new information they're affirming on the record that the Turks believe this Saudi team scout at places to dispose of a body did aired on confirming any of the other\nTo dispose of a body did aired on confirm any of the other various news reports about bits of damning information\nWell probably the biggest thing that has come out so far in anonymous ah reports from investigators is the claim of a

dot com slash NPR\nAnd from the ... foundation\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Noel King and I'm Steve Inskeep much is at stake this fall as Americans vote for Congress but in the long term there may be\nMore at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they are elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others they will have great influence and drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress and other legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group tried to give Democrats influence after twenty Twenty one is the problem that you're trying to address\nWe're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um\nAre Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the the people\nLet's be blunt when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat one that is slanted more Democrats than Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their badge\nNo I don't I don't criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\nWell we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen\nThe governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen who will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one state legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact that we want to have one twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we\nBe bringing and the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing we've\nRaised I guess about a I guess over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting land so governors always matter\nA state legislators matter but in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor or the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting and he'd earls\nOr who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin Supreme Court seat\nArgue campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nOh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says as they have been written\nThat we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally and I think ensure a a fair process\nOne other thing attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made too much you lift off a famous remark by Michelle Obama\nYou know when they go low [noise] they go low\nWe you know what did you mean or what I meant ... ... ... in that remark was that\nWhat did you mean or what I meant ... in that remark was that uh I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate well\nI certainly think votes through protests um I I just say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes\nUm you know I I'd be going at them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump ... who was very powerful when young people marched here I'm In Washington

question\nAnd the plaintiffs want to use a deposition uh questioning of Ross in order to get more evidence is all preparation for a trial\nThat is expected to begin on November fifth in New York could
