as US ambassador to the United nations hilly announced her departure yesterday morning President Trump was alongside her at the White House\nWhat we have a number of people that would very much like to do is a great position to Nikki realize she's uh she's I think she's helped make it a much better position\nNow Haley is not leaving immediately she's going to stay on through the end of the year

has done in foreign policy and she did carry forward a number of the president's America First initiatives at the un ah but she ended up being a much more forceful voice on American values in
