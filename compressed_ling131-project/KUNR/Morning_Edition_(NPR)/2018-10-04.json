story morning Ryan good morning so let's start with the FBI investigation it's\nFollowing the story morning Ryan good morning so let's start with the FBI investigation itself I mean this was never supposed to actually draw conclusions about these allegations against Kevin randomly remind us what additional information the Senate was hoping to to get from this supplemental background check as they're calling it well\nThe answer to that question kind of depends on whether you're a Republican or Democrat so ... what Republicans wanted was for the FBI to focus on that Christine Blasey Ford's allegations\nAre and the second allegation from Deborah Ramirez about sexual misconduct or that they allege a Brett Kavanaugh committed a Ramirez is of course a classmate of Kavanaugh's uh her story is that a Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party when they were both in college\nDemocrats as opposed to Republicans Democrats wanted a more in depth look at those allegations and for the FBI to kind of follow any leads are witnesses that might spin off of those so\nA Democrats have also increasingly talked about Kavanaugh's drinking um since that could have bearing on his behavior at the time of the legit incidents but the key thing to remember here is that uh the White House is the one in control of background investigation and the scope the FBI does this background investigation at the behest of the White House\nThe president controls the parameters and the president has said while he's fine at the FBI talks to anybody out there or that he was providing direction to the FBI based off of what Senate where Republicans wanted\nOkay well then I mean given all of that do we know what the scope was like who the FBI actually spoke to we don't know specifically what the scope was but I've been able to confirm six people that the FBI talked to was part of this or the bulk of the FBI's work appears to be focused on Ford's allegations\nTake a moment this morning to follow us

epidemic swept across Brazil as a result thousands of babies were born with microcephaly or abnormally small heads among other impairments that come with that\nAround the same time BBC producer William Kramer had a child of his own who was also born with microcephaly although not because of the guy\nCramer wanted to know how Brazil's so called ... babies were developing so we went there and produced a radio documentary called seek a love stories among the people he met words ... she's the head of a support group for parents called United mothers of angels\nThey lost the emotional and he'll know ... to get him out of ... gave us two options either be a victim and don't do anything or become a protectionist into the lives of these kids I\nTalked with William Kramer about his reporting earlier this week can you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a Christ\nTo Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of busy a crisis and you meet this network of matter\nYeah that's right I mean it was I was quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was a um they were very very they get it they were very tight group loss of solidarity very determined women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us there was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common for special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the ... mothers of angels\nOr this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's just that one of the states which was was affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you know really quite a powerful personality or she doesn't mince I was you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking\nA but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic him pays ... people have started to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible process that their children on may not even survive\nBeing a horrible process that their children on may not even survive beyond a year so I'm ... how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those said it's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are things that chest infections for three breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most is\nThey they were very mixed group of children so there was some children who can walk to can stand there was some children who ... woods and can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind ... is it you know at the at that age\nBut then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achievements that told me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who were more physically disabled or actually called me to the left side and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around\nIt's an incredibly mixed thing\nI'm not so much so that you actually tell the stories twins girl who was born with the virus and her brother did not was not affected\nYeah it was you had this franchise it'll go Melissa Victoria she was crude or she really couldn't move very much a tool she seemed very aware of what was going on around her but then she had had twin brother who was turned off him who he was acting just like you would expect it to an offer a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they didn't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin and another ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that some\nThat it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that some people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the cap\nYou write that the affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nWhat ice or is that the families are really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise] what school are they going to go to ... and how would they be able to access to school um will moms be able to go back in and work again what they can is about child care and and\nSo we're able to join 'em that they actually shown as far as if she went around some of the more deprived parts of northern Brazil and she was kind of giving talks to these women and giving them pep talks and just sort of saying you know you need to write to the man you need to write to the health effects to tell him to give you a bus to take your child's school you know this kind of thing\nAnd those are the kinds of social campaigning top issues that they really start to deal with now\n[noise] I Wonder because he has his personal connection because your own daughter

L. dot com\nOn a Thursday you're listening to MORNING EDITION on K you went are good morning I'm presenter\nSeveral factors could shape the upcoming midterm election in Nevada state now has about one point five million active registered voters which is a record number\nDemocrats have a nearly five point lead over registered Republicans also in Nevada could make history as the first female majority led state house he went ours on grey checked in with a political science professor for Truckee Meadows community college to learn more\nPrecious ... thank you for talking with us today thank you on so in this upcoming mid term Democrats are hoping for what has been referred to as this blue wave do you think that will pan out in Nevada\nThink it's very possible because one of the things that we have to understand is that Nevada over the past few elections has steadily becoming more blue so we actually right now currently have more Democrats registered to vote in the state of Nevada\nThan we do Republicans so if we're going to see the effect of the blue wave anywhere Nevada will be one of the likely states that we would see that in Hillary Clinton carried the state and twenty six ... Obama carry the state in two thousand eight and two thousand and twelve so we've really been in this blue section for a while now so\nNevada is turning for more swing some more blue but of course that could always change and\nBlue but of course that could always change\nAnd then what's in Nevada GOP than doing to push back on this so called blue wave and there are a few big races that play in this mid term we have the governor's race and then we have also the U.S Senate race between Dean Heller and Jacky Rosen\nWhile the Republicans are definitely trying to do their best to register more voters because at the end of the day it comes down to the voters it doesn't matter how much money you spend them an election it doesn't matter how much money you spend on a campaign if you can't turn out the voters to come and support your candidate it's not going to happen\nSo where we see the Republicans really trying to gain ground in by making sure that they're getting people registered they're getting people to the polls they're educating people about early voting when the election is because ultimately it comes down to the voters\nAnd then another big voting block that people are really paying attention to our winning\nIn the last general election there were unprecedented numbers of women in particular advocating for women's rights and for quality and we started seeing even more deaths as record breaking numbers of protesters showed up at the women's march which took place the day after the Trump integration\nSimilar thing this movement could create a pink wave do you think when voters will be shaping this upcoming election well\nI think women voters have a shape many elections I think one of the critical factors in any election has been\nThe vote of the female voter and one of the things that we have to think about particularly when we think about twenty sixteen women were instrumental not only in the elections but particularly for Donald Trump you had a lot of women particularly conservative\nTrump you had a lot of women particularly conservative who are voting in support of their husbands so the women's vote has always been crucial\nAnd one could really say that this year so the last year and a half twenty Seventeen twenty eighth team has almost been the year the woman politically\nI mean you had the resurgence of women coming out being vocal being critical throwing their hats in the ring we have more women running for office\nThis election then we have in a very long time you have a lot of unprecedented things that are happening as far as women candidates I mean if you think about nationally you have a Stacey Abrams who's on the verge of becoming the first black female governor of Georgia\nYou have a woman who unseated released some solid incumbents in Massachusetts and New York\nAnd in Nevada we have more women on the ballot on the state level so we've really seen sort of a resurgence of women kind of being confident to not only voice their opinions but to step in and to say we want to be the people who make these decisions\nSo it's certainly we're calling a pink way but I really could say we can definitely call this sort of the year of the woman which is really sort of reminiscent of what happened in the early nineties when we had a large wave of women elected to Congress this is reminiscent of that time\nThat it could be history making in this upcoming election because we could have the first female majority state house and how competitive or the races here in Nevada\nIn the morning as senators read through the

what China's leaders really want is to shape how the world perceives their country they're devoted massive resources to this and the center of these efforts to shape perceptions is China's Supreme leader himself teaching paying NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Beijing on she's message and his media\nThe China Daily is the country's biggest English language newspaper by circulation I met with some of their young journalists recently at a cafe outside their headquarters they has to be identified only by their English first names as they weren't authorized to speak to foreign media\nOne of

there's a lot more reports on his family life compared to previous leaders\nBut behind the feel good coverage she's use of the media has helped him to consolidate his own political power to a degree

a story effectively and she is that character\nOn that you had to hunt down when the when he was in we call our leader the promoter in chief of the nation's public image himself takes this very

that China's story and its example of high speed economic growth is found more receptive audiences in many developing countries\nWe should think about the broader picture that many other countries would still probably continue to see China as strong global actor and a partner and investor and all of those things\nBut independent analyst Wu ... says that China is having a harder time coming up

Obama carry the state in two thousand eight and two thousand twelve so we've really been in this blue section for a while now so\nNevada is turning for more swing some more blue but of course that could always change\nAnd then what's in Nevada GOP than doing to push back on the so called blue wave and there are a few big races that play in this mid term we have the governor's race and then we have also the U.S Senate race between Dean Heller and Jacky Rosen\nWhile the Republicans are definitely trying to do their best to register more voters because at the end of the day it comes down to the voters it doesn't matter how much money you spend in an election it doesn't matter how much money you spend on a campaign if you can't turn out the voters to come and support your candidate it's not going to happen\nSo where we see the Republicans really trying to gain ground in by making sure that they're getting people registered they're getting people to the polls they're educating people about early voting win the election is because ultimately it comes down to the voters\nAnd then another big voting block that people are really paying attention to our winning in the last general election there were unprecedented numbers of women in particular advocating for women's rights and for your quality and we started seeing even more deaths as record breaking numbers\nOf protesters showed up at the women's march which took place the day after the Trump integration\nSome are saying this movement could create a pink way do you think when voters will be shaping this upcoming\nDo you think when voters will be shaping this upcoming election well\nI think women voters have a shape many elections I think one of the critical factors in any election has been the vote of the female voter and one of the things that we have to think about particularly when we think about twenty sixteen women were instrumental\nNot only in the elections but particularly for Donald Trump you had a lot of women particularly conservative who are voting in support of their husband so the women's vote has always been crucial\nAnd one could really say that this year so the last year and a half twenty Seventeen twenty Eighteenth has almost been the year of the woman politically\nI mean you had the resurgence of women coming out being vocal being critical throwing their hats in the ring we have more women running for office\nThis election then we have in a very long time you have a lot of unprecedented things that are happening as far as women candidates I mean if you think about nationally you have a Stacey Abrams who's on the verge of becoming the first black female governor of Georgia\nYou have a women who unseated really some solid incumbents in Massachusetts and New York\nAnd in Nevada we have more women on the ballot on the state level so we've really seen sort of a resurgence of women kind of being confident to not only voice their opinions but to step in and to say we want to be the people who make these decisions\nSo it's certainly we're calling a pink way but I really could say we can definitely call this sort of the year of the woman which is really sort of reminiscent of what happened in the early nineties when we had a large wave of women elected to\nEarly nineties when we had a large wave of women elected to Congress this is ... and all that time\nThat it could be history making in this upcoming election because we could have the first female majority state house and how competitive or the races here in Nevada", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "04"}
