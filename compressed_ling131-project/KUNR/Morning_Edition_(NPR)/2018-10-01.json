options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are\nA niche product always have been that's Doug ... of it\nA niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nSimply another choice for consumers for many ah is more affordable than the other products of Illinois and the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage\nMore than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option instead\nOf remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA policies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten\nFive dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the duck the blitz met people have something called health insurance but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options are look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people Alison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes from exact science is offering cola guard for average risk adults over

I Hope you got the irony of what I said I understand I Do\nFinal thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you is there also a risk in

thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe most fun of people you have to be implemented in reality but fortunately fought using the walkers and making the ... and\nInside it almost lost\nHuh and by then he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control of the jobs lack of freedom for people not

polling stations right\nYeah that was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has always been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the PKK immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in a very few polling stations we got in one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballots so there's an election official taking out each paper ballot because they decided not to do the automated their ballot counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the names of each party's very laborious process so even at this approved polling station which you'd think would be like super squeaky clean people trying to get in with fake IDs huh but really the question is whether the violations or serious enough to put the results in question\nRight so I mean we've heard for generations I Hope the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's an in an innate tension between the Kurdish regional government and the

Code where they grow up and online data to all being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries chatty has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you were virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard law to improve those odds so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map\nYou can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder of what are the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nChatty founded moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot\nSome kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten a head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen shed he and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you knew anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte's image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nAdolescent surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years worked with people who live in poverty so I saw what she saw was a segregated\nCity where a low income black residents especially faced a little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem the group identified early childhood development\nCollege and career readiness family stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility it's singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at as to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I had a ... right now it's just kind of a ... mouth of median income\nCharlotte that a lot of Williams from the Chinese team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes\nTeddy team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte and clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility if it's green or blue it has higher opportunity for\nThe outcomes for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank Barnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is that\nThe fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to\nOn these data and I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration that community partnership Charlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school\nIt's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but assistant principal Eric ... says the schools students are mostly\nBlack and Hispanic so we have forty point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white it's not unusual\nFor a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods\nThat segregation hinders upward mobility James e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now but when in the coming years\nBlack and brown now but when in the coming years it changes it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThis hedge field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man this social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead\nThose kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood Ford says the opportunity at least should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us making really smart and really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years not allowed to look and say yet that was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction Mecklenburg county which encompasses Charlotte has committed to providing pre K for all children the city of Charlotte has a fifty million dollar bond issue for affordable housing on November ballot\nRoss chatty

whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are\nA niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products available and the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage\nMore than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nCan renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the ... met some people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules the insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover\nAnd what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News\nSupport for your health comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive\nRisk adults over fifty a non

being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries Jedi has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you were virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improve those thoughts so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map\nYou can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income let our border of the places where the outcomes don't look as good\nSome kids climbing the income ladder of what are the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope citizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nChatty founded moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten a head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen shed he and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you know anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte's image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nAdolescent surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so\nI saw what she saw was a segregated city where a low income black residents especially face the little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem the group identified early childhood development college and career readiness families stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance up\nStability and strong social networks as key factors that enhanced upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle and now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at as to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that fear right now it's just kind of pure map of median income in Charlotte said\nA lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte inflicts on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility if it's green or blue it has higher opportunity\nFor the for the outcomes for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank\nBarnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is that\nThe fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to\nAct on these data I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration in the community partnership Charlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school\nIt's located in a majority white maybe not far from downtown Charlotte but it's just in principle Eric ... says the schools students are mostly\nBlack and Hispanic so we got forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white it's not unusual\nA public school in Charlotte to have a student body this largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregate\nPrivate schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility James e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now but when in the coming years the changes are starting to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThis hedge field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be a high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man this social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead\nThose kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood Ford says the opportunity at least should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us making really

broke out\nWe initially thought it was fireworks because we're in Vegas and we quickly realized as we spent around to look that the man behind us had been shot through the neck and was\nDead on the ground essentially and his wife was screaming and we knew right then that this was real and this was happening as soon as there was a break in the shooting we got up and ran and then when the shot\nStarted again we you know hit the hit the ground\nAnd stuff and people who are falling on top of it is at one point\nI was down on the ground and a man and his wife are on top of my legs and I couldn't move and I felt like if I couldn't get out then there was no way I was going to make it out\nAnd so I just as begging them to please get off of me please you know get off my legs so that I could get up and run the next time that the shots stopped we were actually ah my best friend and her husband and I were on the concert grounds for the entire ten plus minutes the shots were being fired\nTrying to escape I didn't know where my husband was I didn't know if he was alive and I could think was my two kids are at home and I have to get back to them\nYou're kids weren't with you but they must have their own journeys they've been on the last year was the process but like for them and how are they doing um I think it's\nBeen a little bit of a challenge for them um there's certain

back with me last year and I woke up on New Year's day and I said\nI'm going back I'm going to face this head on I feel like I Need to confront it my friend who's a therapist actually went with us as well we walk the site we went to the healing garden which was beautiful and amazing\nUh met some fellow survivors there as much as we could we walked the route that I took to escape which ended up being I'm close to five miles of running we found out\nYou mentioned therapy how's that going\nSo I knew right away that I needed therapy as soon as I Walk through security um at the airport in Vegas my shirt was covered in blood\nAnd I was just completely in la la land I was in shock I was an absolute shock my husband said you need to talk to somebody and I was shaking I just couldn't stop shaking I was shaking nonstop and he said if you're shaking because you're cold that's one thing\nIf you're shaking because of what we've been through then that's another and you need to get some

shot before Halloween Allison Aubrey NPR News\nOkay if you're looking for a cheaper health insurance then you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits\nBuyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers for many ah is more affordable than the other products of Illinois and the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage\nMore than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nWho think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nAnd then they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage that's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the duck double as met people have something called health insurance but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options are look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules the insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a
