S. conflict with North Korea he's written a history of Americans in a brutal battle in the dead of winter which happened when Americans try to unify north and South Korea\nIs still in the city has\nA radio announcer giving the news of the U.S military landing at a port city near Seoul in Nineteen fifty [noise] North Korea had started the war invading the U.S back so the United states and its allies struck back with this landing\nCommanded by one of the ... most famous general\nDouglas MacArthur his landing worked as this old movie newsreel Parkland\nSeemingly in the war and read the turning point I was a fire started and certainly move all the north Koreans\nSeemingly Hampton Sides says MacArthur is forces recaptured South Korea's capital\nAnd he began to get kind of greedy\nThe new book on desperate ground examines the plan the MacArthur devised next\nWhy stop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nTroops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south but what us\nAloul dividing north and south but what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans as a threat and a huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he sweat this information under the rug\nWhat was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name is general Oliver Smith\nRealize that this was a perfect scenario for and circle meant he was very fresh and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure\nAnd none of these troops were prepared for fighting in these kinds of conditions you\nIncredible detail of and\nYou've given incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots on\nYou know this is Hector kept Retta to receive the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night he may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nThe Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never killed a man before he'd never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded\nTwenty thousand trapped in the choice in reservoir slogged and fought their way is sixty miles to the evacuation important to know\nThose mountains I feed prices they held off two hundred thousand [noise]\nThe first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops retook North Korea and the country's remain divided today the dividing line only slightly changed but the Korean people those who survived changed a lot they had a different perspective on this story we just heard\nYou focus on one particular Korean leave by silk who wasn't\nWell Dr Lee as he is now known he was a North Korean kid and um escaped to the south moved to soul as a a teenager\nOnly to have the war reach soul in Nineteen fifty when North Korean forces invaded his\nUncle and his aunt were both murdered many of his friends were murdered\nGoal in his aunt were both murdered many of his friends were murdered you had to hide out in a house in\nSeoul he hid until American forces entered the city blasting to ruins as they took it back\nThe capital city of Seoul [noise]\nImmediately volunteered with the Marines and they gave him an assignment which was to go be an interpreter and a guard in the very city that he had grown up in North Korea ...\nWhat ... experiences as an American interpreter in the north\nHe was assigned to guard a bridge in his home town a bridge they called the bridge of long life\nAnd he was there to prevent refugees from crossing it he hated this assignment but then he found out that his sister was on the other side of the bridge of long life\nAnd that she was not allowed to cross and that his whole family was about to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're going to have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevail do over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she rejoined her family and and made it to the south\nLead by ... survived the war and emigrated to the United states he is now Dr Lee by ... of Cincinnati, Ohio and American citizen and Hampton Sides was able to interview him for this book\nBecause this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime long what is it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a period where North Korea has been exploding nuclear weapons and launching missiles\nKorea has been exploding nuclear weapons and launching missiles and then sending their leader to be with President Trump and everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand in Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a work could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting because there is such a profound desire both in the north and the south for some kind of a improvement in the relationship [noise]\nHampton Sides is the author of on desperate round the Marines at the rents are for\nThe Korean War is greatest battle thanks very much weight to be with you\nThis is NPR News\nOn Sunday Brazilians vote for their next president and Paul suggest many women

women are protesting Brazil's leading candidate with the hash tag not him that story this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned his sons any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten and\nCooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing that's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State\nTrauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing a saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation and the case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump is the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this ...\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin Kaste NPR News [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] It's

I think here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee failed to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not\nWell out of a hundred and sixty three nominations residents of center the Senate a hundred and twenty five uh been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on so always die means\nThat's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nAbout a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first\nSense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell who the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like this\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches than the man President Reagan named after Bork a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted him off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house of representatives said he'd wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew\nUm but then the Senate failed to go along and that pretty much ended the idea of removing the justice for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth or Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result of what is it with these lifetime appointments well lots\nOf judicial plans in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age some at both uh they've been talk of\nMandatory retirement age summit both a there been talk of an Eighteen year term limits were Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a change in the long run the

Kavanaugh and this kind of conversation is kind of the exact opposite of what they are trying to do\nAnd I think she'll probably also point out that the president has made clear that he takes this

you know I Know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them this on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process so it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right there ...\n... by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach and so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up\nPutting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including ... that's what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better

this is MORNING EDITION\nFrom NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep let's recall a Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through no judge Brett Kavanaugh as contentious Senate hearing last week recall them earlier ones including a Nineteen\nLast week recalled some earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown between Democratic senators and them federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy led the attack\nIn Robert Bork America there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not ...\nWell I'm a hundred and sixty three nominations residents are sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on so we don't have the\nMeans that it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice a before deceptive chief also found in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of our question is interesting because Brecht Kevin\nCommitted while the other part of her question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like this\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after Bork a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because either legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely uh the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with him politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric\nJohn Randall off in the house of representatives said hid wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew um but then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing the justice for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from personal Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result of what is it with these lifetime appointments\nLots of judicial plans in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age some of both uh there been talk of the Eighteen year term limits for Supreme Court justice\nBut I Eighteen year term limits worms Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a change in the long run the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much thank you Steve commentator Cokie Roberts and you

presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate to ... to know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the notes\nWhat did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution\nAnd so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness to the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzymes do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that within spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith\nDeveloped a technique called phage display it uses the virus to infect bacteria and it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and applied it to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness and too important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process I mean you know ends\nProve almost any industrial process I mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from of NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel ours are actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this

News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep the historian Hampton Sides has been exploring the origins of the U. S. conflict with North Korea he's written a history of Americans in a brutal battle in the dead of winter which happened when Americans try to unify north and South Korea\nIs still in the city [noise] that's\nA radio announcer giving the news of the U.S military landing at a port city near Seoul in Nineteen fifty [noise] North Korea had started the war invading the U.S back south the United states and its allies struck back\nWith this landing commanded by one of the ... most famous general\nDouglas MacArthur his landing works as this old movie newsreel Parkland\nSeemingly in the war and read the turning point as a fresh start in ... and certainly move all the north Koreans\nSeemingly Hampton Sides says MacArthur is forces recaptured South Korea's capital\nAnd he began to get kind of greedy\nThe new book on desperate ground examines the plan the MacArthur devised next\nWhy stop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nTroops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south but what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans that threat and the huge Chinese army was soon cry\nSoon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he sweat this information under the rug what\nWas the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name is general Oliver Smith\nRealize that this was a perfect scenario for and circle meant he was very fresh and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure\nAnd none of these troops were prepared for fighting in these kinds of conditions\nGiven incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after ...\nAnd only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots on\nYou know this is Hector kept Retta to receive the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night he may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nThe Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never killed a man before he'd never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded\nTwenty thousand trapped either chosen reservoir slog than pop through weighs sixty bitter miles to the evacuation important to them not to snow clad mountains I feed prices they held off two hundred\nThe first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops retook North Korea and the country's remain divided today the dividing line only slightly changed but the Korean people those who survived changed a lot they had a different perspective on this story we just heard\nYou focus on one particular Korean leave by smoke who wasn't\nWell Dr Lee as he is now known he was a North Korean kid and um escaped to the south moved to soul as a a teenager\nOnly to have the war reach soul in Nineteen fifty

not allowed to cross and that his whole family was about to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're going to have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevailed all over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she rejoined your family and and made it to the south\nLead

divided nation is still less than one lifetime long\nWhat is it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a period where North Korea has been exploding nuclear weapons and launching missiles and then sending their leader to meet with President Trump and everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand and Eighteen where there's so many\nSee and I'm living in two thousand and Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a word could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting because there is such a profound desire both in the north and the south for some

say tainted\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing and saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in that case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom Trump ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation into case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he hopes to train sex crime investigators while it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this investigation\nThat kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks and sometimes\nTax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes

no judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week\nRecalled some earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown between Democratic senators and then federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme\nCourt for Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee failed to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not ... well\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations residents who sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on so we don't have the\nMeans that it's not controversial and that at all in favor say aye\n... means that it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice a forge us up to chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then the man President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because either legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin chrome rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused them to be removed\nWould be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric\nJohn Randall off in the house of representatives had hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly know um but then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons\nAnd and that pretty much ended the idea of removing the justice for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my heard from birth to Connecticut I was wondering two other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result of what is it with these lifetime appointments well lots\nOf judicial plans in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age summit both uh they've been talk of the Eighteen year term limits fares Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a change in the law or the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much and he seems commentator Cokie Roberts and
