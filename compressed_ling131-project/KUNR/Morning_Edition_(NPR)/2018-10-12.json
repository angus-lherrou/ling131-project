of them have been city attorney that the current city attorney is Carla Hall\nHe's finishing up his first term which is four years and he wants a second term as opponent is John Catholic and he was a RINO city attorney for eight years two terms um before Carl hall was elected\nHe says that when he decided not to run for reelection four years ago\nUm he was getting a little older and you know maybe had some health concerns\nBut after four years of that he says this health is fine and he's eager to get back to work and he's not a real fan of how Carla Hall has done the job either I ... had a bit

providing too much information about the investigations tangy Klinger\nOf not informing the Reno city council that their city manager was under investigation it was an awkward period because it said he really did have policies and procedures for dealing with a complaint against the top guy in charge of the city\nDo you believe this lawsuit is changing the way Reno residents are viewing the city
