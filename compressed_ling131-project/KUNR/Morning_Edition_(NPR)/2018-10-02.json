Brett Kavanaugh this week and with the Supreme Court nominees still in the news it's hard for a lot of us to get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how different the tone was of the two witnesses\nDr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impasse citizens had on my life and I my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own behalf\nHis number one in the class I don't know I thought oh no no no no no no no not this I'm gonna I'm gonna go\nSo this I'm going to I'm going to borrow more I don't know I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about my high school run over the city on ...\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use\nAnger fury\nTears in a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her for Easter has\nBeen exploring the idea of women and anger and her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen\nElection anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the intra ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history and\nIt obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about that\nAnd it was really just missed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march\nSeriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week\nAnd of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then meet you\n[noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women's anchor well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government\nSo they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women [noise]\nYou referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment I think it's ...\nAre being heard loudly enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading fingers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed and their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement erupts\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality\nOf the harm they sustained but in fact all of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise] that's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years and we have\nOther weeks in the past ... years although we have to say there are plenty of women who support Calvin all women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so as women think are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still I think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time\nAnd the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future\nRebecca Traister is the author of the book good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger is out today\nAnd\n\n\n\nThis is NPR News I'm\nDrinking water around

currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn rape playing with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course a tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to use the tension to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs is pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens\nAnd regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in a raft and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of veneer of objective science attorney rifling says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIt's a pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people\nAnd that the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse or there's various factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist fen already knows that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges\nThis new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nOh that makes it should also [noise] right that's right and I was like it shouldn't be armed people there in in the\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry ...\nAnd it's under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box on industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot

French scientist and Donna Strickland a Canadian both of whom did much of their work at the University of Rochester what does that work\nThey did something called a shirt pulse amplification this is a technique that allows you to take a pulse of laser light and make it more powerful and that was a real problem early on in the development at the laser or you know list\nProblem early on in the development at the laser or you know lasers were developed decades ago but then they sort of got brighter and brighter and then they stalled out in this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that helped them find many applications\nOkay we're going to talk about the applications in a moment but I Do want to ask how big a deal is it to see Strickland to see her name attached\nTo the Nobel Prize in physics well this is only the third Nobel Prize in physics to go to a woman in the past hundred and Fifteen Years while uh the the last one was in Nineteen sixty three and so Donald strict and was asked about this in the press conference and even she seem a bit surprised by that\nFact you are that the woman ever getting that no prize in physics often let's get comments on that\nOkay I might have been\nBut it is true yeah there's only been a few others in Nineteen sixty three in Nineteen Ninety three and there have been many good female physicists who has been widely held were overlooked\nDoes surprise does this suggest a an advancement for women physicists\nI'd say it's more like the Nobel Prize is trying to stay relevant in the heart scientists especially a Internet entrepreneur and started this new age we're in have started giving their own prices\nThis year one of those prices went to a woman named Jocelyn bell burnout who had herself and overlooked for a Nobel Prize that prize was first three million dollars the Nobel or just for around a million new so you know I think the Nobel Prizes are falling behind the times and they recognize that and that's really\nInteresting okay there's a third ...\nAnd that that's really interesting okay there's a third Nobel Prize winner Arthur Ashe can is his name Bell Labs in New Jersey the place where he did much of his work um optical tweezers is the phrase in front of my eyes here what an optical tweezers\nThey are actually exactly what they sound like which using lasers which is light tumbled physical things objects wow and that actually works believe it or not light can exert a little bit of pressure and so\nIf you tuned to lasers just right you can manipulate very very small things are really tiny particles when you're having any individual Adams even wow and so what are the practical applications of the work of these three people\nWell the optical tweezers are used in a variety of applications um for moving around small biological molecules proteins DNA things like that and also in physics it's used pretty widely\nUm and then the lasers are the main sort of public use most common uses laser eye surgery are pulse simplification gets used to and laser eye surgery on this day changed the lives of many people over the last many years fortunately\nNot mine so I had a glass

Kavanaugh this week and with the Supreme Court nominees still in the news it's\nHard for a lot of us to get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how different the tone was of the two witnesses Dr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impasse citizens had on my life and I my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own behalf\nOf his number one in the class I don't know I thought oh no no no no no it's going to say this I'm going to I'm going to go on no I'm I'm sure I'm going to talk about my high school record our city on mocked me was\nThat was an exchange

yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her\nFor Easter has been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger the moment\nThat it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen\nElection anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down there\n... what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week and of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then\nMeet you [noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women's anchor well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protested in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long when in fact it's women of color who have been the\nWhen in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases have been brutally sexually harassed and their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was Anita Hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement erupts\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality\nOf the harm they sustained but in fact all of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years and we have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so as women thing are only a productive force if it's done in the service\nBy the left so as women think are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda not at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this was part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future\nRebecca Traister is the author of the book good and bad the revolutionary power of

French scientist and Donna Strickland a Canadian both of whom did much of their work at the University of Rochester what does that work\nThey did something called a short pulse amplification this is a technique that allows you to take a pulse of laser light and make it more powerful and that was a real problem early on in the development of the laser or you know lasers were developed decades ago but then\nThey sort of got brighter and brighter and then they stalled out and this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that helped them find many applications\nWe're going to talk about the applications in a moment but I Do want to ask how big a deal is it to see Strickland to see her name attached to the Nobel\nTo see Strickland to see her name attached to the Nobel Prize in physics well\nThis is only the third Nobel Prize in physics to go to a woman in the past hundred and Fifteen Years while uh the the last one was in Nineteen sixty three and so Donald Strickland was

have been\nFun but it is true yeah there's only been a few others in Nineteen sixty three in Nineteen Ninety three and there have been many good female physicists who has been widely held were overlooked does surprise does\nThis suggest a an advancement for women physicists\nI'd say it's more like the Nobel Prize is trying to stay relevant in the heart scientists especially a Internet entrepreneur and started this new age we're in have started giving their own prices this year one of those prices went to a woman named Jocelyn bell burnout who had herself and overlooked for a Nobel Prize\nThat prize was for three million dollars the Nobel or just for around a million new so you know I think the Nobel Prizes are falling behind the times and they recognize that and\nThat's really interesting okay there's a third Nobel Prize winner Arthur Ashe can is his name Bell Labs in New Jersey the place where he did much of his work um optical tweezers is the phrase in front of my eyes

and that actually works believe it or not light can exert a little bit of pressure and so\nIf you tuned to lasers just right you can manipulate very very small things are really tiny particles when you're having an individual Adams even wow and so what are the practical applications of the work of these three people\nWell the optical tweezers are used in a variety of applications um for moving around small biological molecules proteins DNA things like that and also in physics it's used pretty widely\nUm and then the lasers are the main sort of public use most common uses laser eye surgery

Nineteen Ninety four the shoes are twenty four year old agreement or there's two things that are different now want to modernize the agreement back in the day we didn't have\nBefore this is a twenty four year old agreement uh there's two things that are different now want it to modernize is the agreement back in the day we didn't have things like digital trade we didn't have things like biologics which are complex of pharmaceuticals and\nWe have a strong a new disciplines and protections for that so that that's a really good thing\nUh but the big thing really is is what the trade represented likes to call restructuring the old NAFTA basically ah the ...\nRoss Perot giant sucking sound it sent our jobs and factories offshore turned what factories we had more into assembly plants rather than manufacturing and there's really strong incentives now\nUh with the domestic content rules in strong labor and environmental protections to keep those jobs here to factories here\nAnd the ... not

the news it's hard for a lot of us to get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how different the tone was of the two witnesses\nDr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact that it has had on my life and I my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own behalf\nOf his number one in the class and I thought oh no no no no no going on out there so I'm going to them I don't know I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about my high school record our city on ...\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible he had in his arsenal the ability to use\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her for Easter has been exploring\nThe idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen\nElection anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history and\nIt obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week\nAnd of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters\nA year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office and historic numbers and then\nMeet you [noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women's anchor well\nIn part that anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading fingers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us so when we think about me\nThat have remain invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases have been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement erupts\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality\nOf the harm they sustained but in fact all of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past\n... years and we have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so as women thing are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously\nOften politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this was part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future Rebecca Traister is the author of the book good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger it is out today\n\n\nAnd\nThis is NPR News\nI'm drinking water around the country is polluted with actually harmful chemicals which to a wide range of illnesses

Inskeep one woman found a way to attack high health insurance prices\nAnd that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer\nWhich passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who's this woman we're talking about uh sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan in twenty four teen and when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families\nAnd that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go\nBroke so the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nAnd if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us who get our health care benefits through our employers\nAnd part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Maryland Bartlett do differently she had spent Thirteen Years\nWhat did Marilyn Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd who knew how to follow the money and so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid each hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare publishes its prices and so she could see\nThat her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid well and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hard ball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case you had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because the healthcare industry really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are five times the Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape I Wonder if hospitals\nSimply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital that would just say listen our prices are price it took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high priced hospitals\nShe called in the union to campaign against a hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign state wide they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices is there a lesson here for an employer\nIt's talk a little prices is there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for hospitals and other medical costs\nMarilyn would say absolutely yes her message really to employers as you need to push back you need to read the fine print in your contracts\nYou need to demand to know where the money is going and why the costs are so high get an itemized explanation for all of the expenses and when you do that you know you may need to the smaller employers may need to join together with other small employers to increase their leverage\nBut they can bring down the prices Marshall Allen of ProPublica thanks very much thanks so much Steve\nThis is NPR News [noise]\nLet me too movement could bring
