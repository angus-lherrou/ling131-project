way you think last year was one of the deadliest flu seasons in decades an estimated eighty thousand Americans died and a thirty nine year old St Louis man was almost one of them\nNow he's encouraging everyone to do something he had never done before Bram Sable Smith reports\nCharlie hinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu shot he's not against vaccinations or anything like that\nI figured this was something that's dangerous to the elderly and the young not somebody who's held in their thirties\nCharlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at the St Louis realtors association and like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out it was\nWrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week and a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of wrong\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with his nurse practitioner making fellow injure\nI Know you're gonna miss as the other day and you are having from Cheyenne\nYeah they are having grown up and running out and not like\nI still have a call but by and large sums is improved Jones who was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in he already knew he had the flu actually his wife had two but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause organs to fail\nCharlie was put in to medically induced coma for over a week his father and brother flew in from out of town and we're told they may need to say goodbye\nI knew when I woke up that I'd been near death\nHis muscles had atrophied the doctors were worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat\nI basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair\nAll of this from the flu it's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard his doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people to complications from the flu a lack of immunity but Charlie was young and healthy\nIt can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy you're going in\nAnd that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody it doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit got a two for you know I got to visit her and me\nApril sixteenth two days before his thirty ninth birthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for the first\nBirthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for the first time in three months he started driving again in may working part time in June got back to the office in August but the experience was still nine\nAt him I was laying awake at night I'm Still kind of trying to process what I'd gone through this year or so I took to Twitter to share that and and use my stories as an example of this is why you should get a flu shot\nSlowly life is returning to normal for Charlie except for one thing in September for the first time he can remember he got a flu shot for NPR News I'm Bram Sable Smith\nIf you step on the sidewalk outside the NPR headquarters

terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nSame reasons why we have the world's greatest sources of the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lumps don't show them I'm social filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world was with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nNever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six\nCenturies so at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd oh it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than ... percent of of the bigger players um but uh in the past ... years you're you probably are global sales have been out\nPacing your domestic sales while and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ...\nFrom the soldiers are still are but yes they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global market has really increased ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a nap to any agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem ah but at the same time we you know you had distilleries are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate mhm and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away\nAnd well ah we don't like the options on the table this is the

there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause Oregon's to fail\nCharlie was put in to medically induced coma for over a week his father and brother flew in from out of town and we are told they may need to say goodbye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors were worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat\nI basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair\nOf this from the flu it's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard his doctor Kevin

healthy\nIt can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in and\nThat's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody it doesn't offer complete protection but if you get

grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit got a two for you know I got to visit her and me\nOn April

S.\nAnd from Americans for the arts\nOn a Monday you're listening to MORNING EDITION unpaid when our good morning I'm presenter\nOr west Duncan the role of the attorney general is clear to serve as Nevada's top law enforcement official and his career the Republican has served as an assistant attorney general or ... county prosecutor as well as a judge advocate general in the air force he\nSat down with K U ... to discuss the issues\nOn your website you've detailed what you're calling the state for Nevada players don't you tell us a little bit about that well so you know our plan is informed by law enforcement and so uh we heard that the the biggest issue\nAnd so ah we heard that the the biggest issues across the state where one the deficit and mental health resources I've talked about the need for psychiatric ERs you know we're fiftieth in the nation in mental health uh and that's something that we have got to fix if we want to make our communities safer\nAnd so I've talked about the need for psychiatric ERs we need to have jail assessments to try to intervene early for people\nAnd once we start getting a handle on mental health you know it's going to allow law enforcement not to be have to be social workers in mental health providers but it's going to allow them to be able to focus on their job one which should be keeping our communities safe\nIt's time to go into communities that lack hope and say we want to bring economic development we want after school programming we want job skills training or we want mentoring programs to catch kids\nUh before they get into the system to provide people an opportunity to have upward mobility in the economy and so the AG can help\nA shape development agreements that can help shape a things at both the at the city the county in the state level to create more opportunity for people and I think that's a that's one of the things that that the the next day she should be doing\nI I Want to turn our attention to to guns and more specifically the background check law your former boss current attorney general item rock salt has declared the background check law passed and twenty sixteen unenforceable\nI'm curious do you agree with that assessment at this point because this is a complicated issue so our state is what's called the point of contact state\nState is what's called the point of contact state\nWe check not only the federal background check ah the Knicks system they call it but we use our central repository to have local records to do mental health records and so because we have that more robust system there's federal regulations that govern how states can do background checks\nThe folks who wrote the background check law\nWrote it that that said that the central repository wasn't the one that would do the checks it would be the federal government would do the checks will the federal government is governed by federal regulations that say hey your point of contact state so you can't force us to do this if you want to not be a point in contact state than we can do those checks\nOr and so that's the state of the law right now until the federal government changes their regulations or changes the law or the state changes are pointing contacts status\nUm you know that the remains that the state of question one will remain the same\nOr I Want to switch gears and talk about the campaign a little bit your campaign or at least some of your surrogates have logged a criticism at your opponent democratic state senator or a run for for some of the run and run ins with law enforcement that he's had over the years I wanted to get your take on that\nLook we're we're running to be the state's top law enforcement officer in the state and so um when you put your name on a ballot for political office your entire background or you know your experience everything is is fair game\nUh and so for this position in particular um you know or if you want to lead\nUm you know or if you want to lead states law enforcement office and you've got arrest or in your past ah I think that those things are are certainly relevant the other thing that's interesting as well as that or at most a police departments are sheriff's officers\nOr if you have an arrest record in a a history of bad financial mismanagement it's likely that you wouldn't even be hired as a line officer at those agencies and so if a person couldn't be hired as a line officer at those agencies yet wants to lead law enforcement\nIt's seven o'clock ooh\nGood morning when asked about the reality of climate

understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need to drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry sent dirty in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and the homeless Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Graben\nBut he's made it a giant copper still and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers

it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're you probably are global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic sales

international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen or Twenty years the global market has really increased ever since we started with the free trade agreements and the mid

elderly and the young not somebody who's held in their thirties\nCharlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at the St Louis realtors association and like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out it was\nWrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week and a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing

get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit got to do for you know I got to visit her and me\nApril
