say\nTurned on my recorder and I kind of bar did her with my my maybe we should say uh where are you [noise]\nHi this is Cathy I'm Sorry I don't know if you're not going to get my name's yeah [noise] that's\nThe easy but I I'm Catherine Rampell him at home and watching\nThe civically Catherine writes about the economy for the Washington Post and it occurred to us that actually a coffee shop is the perfect place to show this thing that he's furious [noise] All right\nYou're looking at an icy what size you looking for\nAnd I can see now I see\nMuch the same thing with on the board to eighty

is one price on the board and then this extra hidden thing that she has to pay for it and it's not just taxes\nSometimes it's D's and service charges that seemed to appear out of thin air at check out

opposition\nUh and the fact that companies do compete on application does not create a better economy does not create or got better experience for consumers and can in fact raise prices for consumers that they're buying stuff that they don't want for every one is a used car salesman [laughter] I\nGood friend who's a used car salesman so I I don't want to denigrate that profession specifically\nSo what is your one tiny tweak that would change the world\nMy my one tiny tweak is that we should require more all inclusive upfront pricing including taxes fees particularly in common types of consumer purchases where people like to comparison shop\nThe price should be the price [noise]\nThat is how ... how would you make the world better with one simple tweak [noise]\nHello and welcome to plan and buddy I'm Nick fountain Dan I'm Kenny Malone and\nSometime from Planet Money we tackled the world's big questions but today on the show we look for small dancers something we've done here before

hour he was the\nGame yes and not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance\nSo how have\nFans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime\nWell a critically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there has been a lot of angry baseball fans\nBut Steve is not here to win a popularity contest in fact he tells us he's also got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for down to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nYeah we have an idea of a basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd give them
