remember\nAnd we just went back to date by date and then as she told me what she ate you then have to ask what was in it what was on the pizza where do you buy the food from what shocked by what Costco what supermarket\nWhat supermarket and think about what you had for lunch last Wednesday\nI was working at home I got something out of the fridge I don't remember what what did you have for dinner let's say last Thursday\nThe best case scenario for consumers for the FDA even for the farmers\nExcept for the primary who is named ...\nWho is ultimately there can be one person to blame and therefore you're blameless are you at least can avoid um you know direct responsibility\nBut here's the problem Louis did not eat lettuce growing on the same farm is the prisoners\nIt was in one trail of contaminated lettuce were locked trail leading to a crunch of different farms in ...\nMile empire and something else happened in the field one thing we catch a flight to Yuma, Arizona and we are on the phone call I Hope when\n\nAll winter long America salad comes from a narrow valley five miles wide and fifty meandering miles long it follows the Colorado River\nWhen I was there it was blazing hot oppressive when the weather turns cool to this place is perfect for growing crops most of the farmers in Yuma did not really want to talk to me about the cola it is not a pleasant topic obviously\nOne farmer them he said come on over Steve Alameda big lettuce grower co owner of top flavorful\nI found how are you I'm good how are you places amazing he was fall\nGot a plaid shirt and button issues these super friendly and super proud of what he does I say can you show me around he said sure he shows me cotton fields hay fever\nYou're ... shows me cotton fields hay fields some date trees and acres of bare dirt that will turn into lettuce fields\nIn the fall I mean another five months as all agree on the green green vegetables you can grow anything here huh well it's\nIt for a grower would what would I Would just to just be like being in the Silicon Valley I quoted to that\nI tell Steve that I Am on the trail of ... by any of that yeah you and the whole FDA\nHe says there's a team of them poking around that valley testing the water that farmers and used to water their crops and Steve than make she knows exactly where they are like right now\nSo Mike takes my phone and he pulls up a map so I'll jump\nIn right here on the road and and where's the canal\nRight below him if the caller is out there I Am going to find it\nVery good thank you you do you do\nIn my rental car I had to east it takes a while but eventually I find them there was a van and a white suburban nine people\nAlong a concrete line to ditch with water running along the bottom must have been looked like grad students summer wearing blue latex gloves they have cooler high tech scientific equipment every so often one of them reaches down and fills a bucket with water\nAbroad shoulder guy comes over to say hello he's an FDA employee based in Yuma\nHe says they can't tell me much about what they're doing out here it's very sensitive ... and a few hundred feet away there's another canal filled with water this is bigger [noise]\nA bunch of farmers use that water on their lettuce\nFarmers use that water on their lettuce and right next to this water cow as far as the eye can see thousands of them just standing there quiet\nQuiet they wouldn't make any noise he wouldn't know\nAnyway they're standing there on his bare dirt lined up alongside troughs filled with corn and hey\nEating not moving group it had all\nThe animals that most often Carrie ... all one five seven this is where ... comes from humans sometimes but it's usually animals deer wild pigs cows\nThis might be where the long search for the source of the contamination this might be where that search engines actually here goes a truck carrying cattle manure out into the fields where it's come posted driving right past this ditch\nThe FDA style and equal light in this water come out the exact genetic strain that got everyone sick\nTheir theory is that equal life from the cow manure washed into this irrigation ditch or blue and and then the contaminated water just flowed into all the vegetable fields across the valley\nOr talk to Steve about this ditch he doesn't get his water from it but his let us farming friends do and they've actually been worried about these calls for a long time because they're just so close to the vegetables you got [noise]\nLike I say a hundred thousand animals that [noise]\nThat are old culprits basically so\nThat are all culprits basically so you know ... if you'd be you'd be foolish not to not to have that pop in your head [noise]\nAnyway\nBut like I say we're aware of it

again but those cattle are still there and the farmers don't know what to do\nThe FDA hasn't announced any roles are even recommendations for what the farmers should do differently\nAnd the thing that really scares the farmers is the possibility that the people who buy their lead us the big supermarkets and processors\nMaybe they will say we don't trust let us from Yuma anymore we won't buy it Bill Maher earlier the food safety lawyer says they should be worried\nIf there's another outbreak like this I mean a tough question for Wal Mart or a tough question for a Costco is\nWhy do by you know product from a place that you know is near a feedlot that just had an outbreak last year that's a that's a very uncomfortable question that a lawyer gets to ask\nSteve and his fellow lettuce cameras are trying to figure this out one way they're talking about is to treat the irrigation canals with chlorine to kill any equal I\nBut they've also been talking about something more drastic maybe those cows are now just too much of a threat to\n[noise] maybe those cows are now just too much of a threat to the lettuce industry maybe the lettuce farmers have to band together and by the feedlot just to kick the cows out shut it down\nFor centuries farmers have raised their animals and their vegetables side by side but farming has reached such a scale now maybe they can't anymore\nMaybe this valley
