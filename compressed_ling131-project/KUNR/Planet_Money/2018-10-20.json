because like you know I go on line to\nBuy a hover board and I don't know if this record has five stars because it is awesome and I'm On a cruise around town looking cool or if it's five stars because

things\nSo just you know I'll be like in the grocery store and I'll have like an avocado and the onion and a a bottle of water\nThat's high stakes dropping off Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah\nThe story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews begins around two thousand six Tommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen\nAnd it was a bit of a gym rat at his peak he could bench press around two hundred and forty pounds one day Tommy was hanging out with a friend when he says hey you want the rest of this pre workout pre workout it's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and it just gives you crazy\nThat's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and it just gives you crazy energy and you can lift Moran longer and harder um you know at least those are the claims just to be clear this is not a steroid and case that's what you're thinking Tommy is very against using those anyways\n... friend is really not happy with the stuff that he purchased and he says the Tommy I paid sixty bucks for it and it gives me such bad stomach issues that I it's ruining my work out to you know counter productive\nIf you're not familiar with the supplement world it's not a the most tightly regulated world and on top of that back in two thousand and six more and more folks were starting to buy things on line like supplement\nThe gears in my head started turning and I started looking up several interviews and I I couldn't find anything that was legit I mean it was all just written by the manufacturer they could just\nComment on paternity he could build an online review side but body builders give honest feedback about the supplements they're putting into their bodies\nReviews over those five days pretty suspicious especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average people use their way more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue with words that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it\nSo the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the phrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nAfter them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example\n... is able to filter out normal phrases they would show up all the time for example it was the and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the chords do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you shouldn't see that in more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews [noise]\nUm yeah and and in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the cord and to use again ah I don't know what it means seven people feel that way\n[laughter] well seven people also say they performed at their duty with honor and respect and there is the correct versus [laughter] yeah\nSo Tommy software vent about a dozen different tests than I Am phone cable reviews and his reports it out and it just it invading\nA so it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating on review Mehta is one point seven stars after ten reviews\nWhich is another way of saying Tommy side only trust it six percent of the reviews and that trust way the reviews say actually these cables that crap\nThomas's generally speaking cable like this are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews\nAnything with like low manufacturing costs and high margins I'm so like what yeah yeah I phoned cables backup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills test\nWe of course reached out to Amazon about this\nThey declined to go on tape but\nCourse reached out to Amazon and about this and they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy's website they send us an extensive statement about it\nHave you met itself admit that they do not have\nThe fifty states you could do this one is like a you know non weightlifter\nOh okay I'm review itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even say with high confidence whether a review is fake according to\nWhat Amazon is saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural\nFor Amazon that as a problem we have hundreds of millions of reviews on Amazon and of that total less than one percent are inauthentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake reviewers\nIn other words Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust the big sites like Amazon or actually going to go out of their way to fix this\nSuch complicate it right because these e commerce sites they make money when they sound more products\nRight like it doesn't matter if it's a positive fake review if someone buys a product that's good for the site but that that might come a time where there is just too many fake ... sure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nEnough trust is lost that we all just give up\nOn the Internet shopping and we'll go back to France chocolate chip [laughter] we won't go back
