I'll be like in the grocery store and all have like an avocado and the onion and a a bottle of\nWater oh that's high stakes you're dropping out of the Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah\nThe story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews begins around two thousand six\nTommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen and it was a bit of a gym rat at his peak he could bench press around two hundred and forty\nPounds one day time he was hanging out with a friend when he says hey you want the rest of this\nPretty workout pre workout that's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym\nAnd it just gives you crazy energy and you can lift more and longer and harder um you know at least those are the claims just to be clear this is not a steroid and case that's what you're thinking Tommy is very against using those anyways\n... friend is really not happy with the stuff that he purchased and he says the Tommy I paid sixty bucks for it and it gives me such bad stomach issues that I it's ruining my work out to you know counter productive\nIf you're not familiar with the supplement world it's not a the most tightly regulated world and on top of that back in two thousand and six more and more folks were starting to buy things on line like supplement\nThe gears in my head started turning and I started looking up several interviews and I I couldn't find anything that was legit I mean it was all just written by the manufacturer they could just\nComment on paternity he could build an online review side but body builders give honest feedback about the supplements they're putting into their bodies\nOkay so for this product we see that over the course of five days this product got Seventy eight percent of their reviews and on top of that the reviews from those high volume days gave the product a four point nine star rating on average the\nAt a four point nine star rating on average these views of those five days pretty suspicious especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average views they weigh more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue with words that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it so the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the\nPhrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nGo after them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was the and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the chords do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you shouldn't see that in more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews [noise] uh yeah\nAnd and in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the court and to use again ah I don't know what it means for seven people feel that way [laughter]\nWell seven people also say they performed at their duty with honor and respect and there is the correct ... [laughter]\nYeah so Tommy software ran about a dozen different tests than I fall on cable reviews and his reports it out and it just aggravating\nUh so it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating on review Mehta is one point seven stars after ten reviews which is another\nOne point seven stars after ten reviews\nWhich is another way of saying Tommy side only trust at six percent of the reviews and the trustworthy reviews say actually these cables that crap\nThomas's generally speaking cable like this are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews\nAnything with like low manufacturing costs and high margins I'm so like what yeah yeah I phoned cables backup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills to stop\nWe of course reached out to Amazon and about this\nAnd they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy website they send us an extensive statement about it have you met itself admits that they do not have the fifty states you could do this one is like a you know non weightlifter\nOh okay I'm review itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even stay with high confidence whether a review is fake according to one\nAmazon is saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural\nFire Amazon that as a problem we have hundreds of millions of reviews on Amazon and of that total less than one percent are inauthentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake reviewers\nIn other words Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust the big sites like Amazon are actually going to go out of their way to fix\nThis science complicate it right because these e commerce sites they make money\nSo it's complicated right because these e commerce sites they make money when they sound more products right like it doesn't matter if it's a positive Ficre view if someone buys a product that's good for the site but that that might come a time where there was just too many fake they'd be sure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nEnough trust is lost that we all just give up yes on Internet shopping\nAnd we'll go back to a friend's child France should we won't go back to our fan from Brenda rate [laughter] well\nThere is a point where it's just that for all of them and we have to go back to talking to her friends again you have to call your mom shopping advice at yes what you pay your youth is among [noise]\n\n\nToday's show was produced by next mountain editor is Bryant or staff or supervising producer Alex gold mark who told me to tell you we could use refuse to print money wise view but please don't get no real reviews like I'm Kenny Malone and I'm healthy ... thanks for listening [noise]\n\nThat was the best story ever all kind of real review Guy Raz [noise] absolutely absolutely OK okay to tell us what's coming up next on how it goes to ...\nComing up we're going to be an entrepreneur who liked him\nComing up we're going to need an entrepreneur who like to run his restaurant chain or a little differently we\nWere making ... finished quest side we buy the spinach frozen we didn't have a way to\nTo get rid of the water and somebody came up with the idea well let's let's buy a dozen clubs dryers ... but but the Spanish and the clothes dryer that will dissipate the water was a great idea until one day we blew the top off the or the ... ended up with spinach in all three thousand square feet of the production space\nFrom NPR Kauai belt that show and then and it made her entrepreneur ... story the movement\nGuy rise and on the show how writers have built a bakery called ...\nAnd then get them being that bill\nBigger restaurant chain\nStick around after the break it's how I built this from NPR you are listening to Planet Money on K U when our public radio for northern Nevada Andy Stern California I'm Tom struggle\nEmitted an affordable housing shortage some of the motels are being torn down in Reno's downtown court or\nAnd many residents are being displaced seniors on fixed incomes families and casino workers who are living in motels as a last resort fear what will happen to them when their options for shelter continue to dwindle\nKatie when ours partnering with our tone Reno to present some of their stories this love journalism event is on Thursday November first from five to seven PM at the desert\nThis love journalism event is on Thursday November first from five to seven PM at the desert rosy and learn more at K.
