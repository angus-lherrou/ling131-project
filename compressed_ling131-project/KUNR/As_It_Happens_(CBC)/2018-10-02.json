I think we're going to be able to get to a to a place 'cause we've kept in place are the rules that protect trade and enforce trade agreements like this\nAnd for his part you as president Donald Trump also declared victory today at a press conference in Washington DC a reporter asked him about tensions between him and prime minister Trudeau here's how we responded\nHe's a professional I'm a professional we had very strong tensions that [noise]\nIt it was just an unfair deal whether it was Mexico or Canada and now it's a fair deal for everybody it's much different deal it's brand new deal not NAFTA re done it's a brand\nIt's not NAFTA ridden it's a brand new deal uh I just spoke with him we have a great relationship but we're going to work as a partner\nDon't forget the rest of the world is looking to take advantage of us and has a region you might say and we're going to work very closely together with Canada and Mexico\nFinding a little more largely I in this deal is going to be the trade off to get the other concessions kind it was seeking did did you see this coming\nWell I'm certainly there's been a precedent set in all trade deals up to date\nThat when he gets it gets down to the wire um they seem to give up a a a percentage of the the dairy market or people like to talk about the powerful dairy lobby in Canada were over three so far as powerful\nAs some Canadian point of view here's what it looks like we were looking at a um a really big dent being put into our manufacturing industry in her ... and in auto uh in in a auto bills in auto parts\nAnd what we traded and also I trade this disputes mechanism this chapter Nineteen that was very important to Canada and in exchange they seem to have given up three point six percent to the Canadian dairy market to us farmers\nThat doesn't seem like it I get such an awful trade to a lot of Canadians I don't think\nWell I I find it interesting you say that because um that they're not the deal is already in place will chaplain Nineteen was already in place\nSo if chapter Nineteen or this or NAFTA panel was such an efficient such a great thing to have a why wasn't doing anything about the aluminum and steel tariffs why wasn't going to be able to protect us from terrorists in our automobile\nOr if if there's not a panel was half worth in a forgiving up the dairy industry or we shouldn't have been concerned about those terrorists than the first place\nWhat would you have done would you have walked away would you said no deal\nIt's very complicated obviously a they were getting ready to uh\nWould you said no deal\nOr it's very complicated obviously a they were getting ready to a hit us with more tariffs so that that was not a good situation for candidates to be following it but um I I didn't find this was like any other trade negotiation at least\nWith ah the Europeans and the Trans Pacific deal uh everyone was there I think it grew sheeting fairly\nThis one was more like extortion\nThis one was that they hijacked sectors of our economy they threatened to do irreparable damage to our economy and if we didn't give them what they wanted or they would proceed with these terrorists um I I found it was very aggressive there wasn't negotiating\nA this wasn't a negotiation this was a negotiating our way out of a hostage situation\nSo again would you walked away then would you said no deal I'm not going to be held hostage\nSome somebody has to do this a wage Trump is proceeding in and and uh the way he's he's ruined I I find so many uh of parts of society or I thought Canada was going to the country\nTo to stand up to them and said you know this isn't right we have rules in place NAFTA already had a certain rules that you shouldn't have been able to to put tariffs on aluminum and steel and they told me to address those issues we shouldn't have been going any further\nWhat we heard today from having to sue to do and some foreign affairs minister freelance\nWas that and they basically said that well that the upside for the dairy farms and dairy farmers is that the supply management system is fundamentals in it at least is still in place and that the dairy farmers are going to be compensated for losses they sat for his part of this trade deals so against Mitt Canadian point of view\nIt's hard to see how we've lost ... what would you say back if you could be at that press conference and respond\nTo see how we've lost ... what would you say that because he could be at that press conference in response to what would you say\nHow did we get to that point that we were no longer looking for a better deal we're just looking to salvage something out of it so that we didn't get completely destroyed I I don't understand why are we allowed ourselves\nTo be on her knees as bad as we want we were in a bad position and uh they negotiated to salvage something but at we weren't smart enough to get ourselves in a better position before there was something about the\n[noise] and now if it does go to as we see it how does that change your life how does that change your work your business\nOr you mentioned the compensation package jets or they've had numerous compensation packages or credit for for other trade deals that I received dollars to date usually instead of giving a money uh over to a during farmers to figure out the best way to distribute it\nThey come up with some bizarre way of uh investing it in our farms and uh if you don't fit or the exact a type that they want for the investment and you're not eligible on the money is always in his shoes so to\nDate I received a hundred dollars\nBut are you going to survive and you're going is your business going to to be okay\nIt's doesn't help I mean the ... of course you know you ... your carry on I'm a I'm Still relatively young I have a son was wanting to come home and farm\nSo uh we'll have to make an investment and are trying to\nBe more efficient survive back the market share that we've lost a lot of money or reinvest that money and and and try and get my cash flow back up to where it was before a lie survival of the rate at which are going a trading off a three plus percent\nUh every year we only know how a A R market share a knowledge Cancun\nThree plus percent uh every year we only know how a A R market share a knowledge Cancun you need to go on forever doing that\nAnd the problem is is next time we go to negotiate no one's ever happy with what they have they'll want orange so if we're already over ten percent of a given up of our market\nThe Americans only allowed to ... percent of free will return percent now\nSo who's who's the protection and who's not a free trader and I will not\nOkay not so good points and Mr is going to appreciate speaking with you thank you well thank you for calling\nJason ... is a dairy farmer we reached mentioned Brooke Quebec and we will have more on the U.S MCA later on in the program including various tongue twisting attempts to pronounce the name of the new agreement and an interview with former conservative cabinet minister Peter McCain\n[noise]\n\nFirst there was an earthquake and then came the water a deadly six meter tuna army\n[noise]\nThat is a clip from a video that has been circulating on social media a man on a balcony warning people below the water is coming\nToday survivor's on the Indonesian island of ... are dealing with the destruction of friday's left behind as we go to air the official death toll is over eight hundred that number is likely to rise to over one thousand\nOfficials have been burying the dead in mass graves Rebecca ...\nBurying the dead in mass graves Rebecca ... is the BBC's Indonesia editor Richard in Palo which was hit by the tsunami\nRebecca can you describe what you're able to see in power right now\nAt the moment I'm standing on one of them in ... in to the worst affected area\nAnd you might hear in the background the sound to have the uh trucks coming in they tiring excavators into the area the has been much needed in the recent day that people being thinking\nFood the rent will within their hands if it hasn't in this heavy building quit meant to try and rescue survive and also to find ... in the rubble of houses that were destroyed by that powerful quake on friday and\nThen also washed away by this now made that was triggered by it\nDo they still believe that they can recover people alive or is this a recovery operation at\nThis point there has been some rescue attempt in the last forty eight hours that have been successful in one place to live in a whole ... or a hotel that\nCollapsed the hotel owner was saying yes today that he was still hearing people yelling out for help and Denise rubble but he was able to reach them they did manage to rescue more than twenty four people though using their hands from that hotel\nBut as the days continue the hopes of finding people alive\nI Would have to say a now ...\nYou have been able to get to the hospitals to see what is happening there who's been ...\nBoth to get to the hospitals to see what is happening there who's being cared for and how they're being cared for wouldn't tell us that tell us what's going on there\nWould be to some of the small medical clinics\nAround ... situation a very bleak and there's no power to the entire town so\nUs through any coup clinics set time too complicated operations are they running out of medical supplies and in most of them the ones that we've been to that road the forties and plastic bags\nIn one that we went to there was a young girl a five year old girl that they had found a loan and she had a broken leg and was crying out in pain on a stretch and not far from the body bags\nShe could remember her name but she didn't know where she lives with her parents were so to the hospital with a little cough and her and more to try and find relatives for her\nThe white my could they get out of its say talking to mark judge who was the the friend Kevin ... who was\nAllegedly in the room when this like assault took place they he is already put out a statement saying that he doesn't remember this or a but it's totally against the character he knows about cabinet to have\nA he doesn't think happened what more could do ... what could the FBI find out from my guide that didn't come out in that statement\nWon't Mark Church is a good example Carol statement that he put out was put out through his lawyer that wasn't sort of tested he wasn't pushed on it he wasn't prodded to remember other details he wasn't asked perhaps for\nThe names of people who might have been there if he continues to claim that he mark judge was not\nAnd so that's why I'm agents wants to talk directly to witnesses I'm not saying that all that but we're put together a false statement or a misleading statement but might have been a cursory statement and it needs to be tested\nAnd some of the things that had been set including by your former boss James Comey is that the the leads that were ...\nThe leads that were presented on Thursday to an investigation would be evidence that a judge Kavanaugh\nMay have lied during his testimony that he may have not been fully open about his drinking habits and about his problems in that area of alcohol\nWhat investigators wanted to know about that would that be something that you need to know more about as to what we're judge Kavanaugh's drinking habits while he was in in high school and in university\nNot necessarily except that it's important that anybody up for confirmation for Supreme Court seat before the Senate Judiciary committee be completely truthful\nSo oddly the underlying conduct whether he drank or drink to excess in high school might not be all that relevant but whether he was honest with the Senate Judiciary committee about his drinking habits I think is relevant\nAnd then there are also the references to the year book that was presented that remarks that were said about that Kevin ... at the time and that he said we're references to drinking when in fact I just said no they were\nReferences to sexual activity and some of it quite quite awful about what they might have done I wanted to do to some women so whether he did or didn't do any of those things that what matters and that that he may have misrepresented what that book was saying\nWell to be clear some of the underlying conduct if he assaulted women is absolutely disqualify a no ifs ands or buts about that on the other hand if it had to do only with drinking I use that term only cautiously it's still\nAnd if it had to do only with drinking I use that term only cautiously it's still very important that he'd be honest about it before the Senate Judiciary committee if however the underlying conduct is um\nThe way he treated women whether he sexually assaulted or abused them in some way or that matters a lot and that's why you want a full FBI investigation to the extent we can find out we need to find out\nAll right we'll be launching Mr Rosenberg I appreciate speaking with you thank you\nCarol thank you for having me on the show and thank you for giving me a chance to talk about the FBI\nI take care Bye bye bye\nChuck Rosenberg is a former senior CIA official who we met his office in Washington DC\nGet me to\nSay what you got ...\nIs a God I was not as\nGot us MCA [noise] as you've heard by now that is the new name for the renegotiated version of NAFTA and does that abbreviations awkwardness has many people annoyed or in the case of Financial Times writer Alan Beatty\nNearly serious Serbia exploded on Twitter trying to stop people from referring to the U. S. M. C. A. as an acronym because he says it cannot be pronounced as a word we reached Alan ...\nPronounced as a word we reached howling B.D in Brussels\nAllen us NCAA doesn't really rolled off the tongue doesn't it\nDoesn't I mean you know somebody's receive ... language as well as trade deals are kind of disappointing because there was such a let me think say the single word you know you could have dumped into slogans like NAFTA we don't have to that kind of thing and not just for then replaced by yet another abbreviation that you can't really say very well\nOkay but you've taken one step but you don't you're not just kind of disappointed you're mad because why because people are using it\nI'm I'm mad because of how people using it I'm also not because people say acronym whether they mean abbreviations and you know an accident was a thing you can say NAFTA is an accident us MCA it'd be ... and I just I don't think we should be but ... the name of acronyms because they happen to them\nBut they said that you said this is a hill that you're willing to die on\nActually yeah obscenity why [laughter] well\nI tell you why I've covered shades for more than ten years okay when I started a as a journalist when I started covering said I realize this is a subject so complicated that the abbreviation started running into full that says before the basic you all this stuff like ... run into three left now he's going to hold on and so keeping in your head\nAll these enormous of evaluations when you came across one that you could she said that was actually a pop the acronym you really want to sort of hold onto it um instead of the fact that this has gone and disappeared and there'll be certainly seems to be out of angry about it that I just find very disappointing\nNow of course people are arguing that in fact you can turn it into an acronym you could say ... or ... or something of that nature right I mean it's not all is not lost on\nThe reality is is a valid shortage that's the problem too is a very ... to ... miles um\n... says that's the problem too is a very ... to ... miles I'm\nJust waiting for them to do this three vowels and there's like well I guess since it was not going to look at you came\nTo that in ... inconvenient any place to either end you see what you really needed some kind of out in the middle east you all people invented they are the ... the or in a in the middle so suddenly as you just said it was ... as a loose some car or something like that one other thing I've noticed which is unbelievably deceitful and these people just switch the conscience around\nUm and so people are kind of got what we can say it was more like you you cook says I Know yeah however that just them in a tribute he won't because it's the constant during the run over\nOkay here's some way to get the next a next is a vowing here since there's us just to ladders Canada see a two letters and actually the only has one letters if you put in ... in ...\nIn this new you'd have ... ... I mean that would be three vowels three countries everyone gets their fair share the six letters and everyone has has their two letters\nThat will be absolutely great if that flooded named it I Would invite you to address you'll come face to\nThe White House Washington DC but you know they didn't do that and why they called why they didn't do that and understand that\nYou could also switches around right some suggesting that we could call it the ah the Canada Mexico us agreement and say see a and you asked would you be Kenny if you did in French\nBuys you that I think it would be perfect that would be absolutely perfect and it was more or less you know the touch of existential despair and the nothing the ... century describing the wall and try to shift the numbers don't trust\nHave ... you can actually put ... into this ...\nIt's just a number of Donald Trump\nYou have ... you can actually put ... into this existential angst and can be both the same thing right\nUp to like I mean I remember the and I think he's done a great novels was and mother died today was it yesterday like ... you know you just uh she ... into\n'em I'm you could say that you could just say exactly the same you know political opposition starts the next thing I Can't remember [laughter] I'm\n... I I Would have gone for if it had been ... they come up with I Would have ... it it it sort of ... of ...\nBut what's what's missing obviously besides the acts of all is the word ... free trade and trade isn't even in the world trade isn't in here free trade open trade managed a no reference to trade\nAnd so that it doesn't it's we don't even know what kind of agreement this is this non acronym pile of laughter doesn't tell us anything does it\nI hate to say 'cause she was playing 'cause they don't really want to talk about that but I'm the idea of changing treat said instead of just not become so discredited you have to look for even this about trade new dance even say what's it about um in shows you know you have an agreement you can't even say politically and it doesn't say much it's about it's just long enough to level\nAnd just for we're noticing today as we were looking interviews we would riding riding on the board NAFTA we just keep using NAFTA all our all of our interview questions all of our internal documents were just calling it NAFTA do you think that people will secretly keep calling it NAFTA despite this new name\nAnd I think it's an eight ... after the Trump won't last you'd make up she assets and whatnot", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Reno", "day": "02"}
