I'm referring to to to that in ... surrounding that in the negotiations surrounding the new uh a U.S MCA deal I I Believe that this deal I Know for a fact this deal could have been done\nA long time ago I Know it could have been done with Canada having a bigger and better voice at the table I was concerned from the beginning that Mexico would go behind Canada's back and negotiate a deal and of course they did do that and then candidate was forced to the eleventh hour to move in and agree to terms that quite frankly that Mexico negotiated\nAnd so I don't know how to do is is bigger and better voice that you feel it should have been at the table why\nAnd so I don't know how to do is is bigger and better voice that you should have been at the table\nWell I think there should have been to a a negotiator at the table who has had years of experience in trade law\nA and I thought good grief I mean why are people bringing this up now because I had a lot of things I agreed with him about and there were a lot of things we disagreed about but it seems to me his opinions are utterly beside the point and irrelevant to the fact that he was a journalist who was murdered\nIrrelevant to the fact that he was a journalist who was murdered\n... what are some of the things that you have heard that you know that that you find quite alarming that us media commentators have been saying this week\nWell one of the things that's come up with the idea that he was an extremist or an Islamist and at some point people even say so sympathetic towards ...\nAnd uh I think that was really a terrible exaggeration he had some sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood there's no question about that that was something I disagreed with him about a quite a lot but the idea that he was an extremist or that he was a a not a journalist but an an activist\nOr even more than an activist a conspiratorial person a conspirator\nIt was all I think a disturbing because I think a lot of it is quite inaccurate and very exaggerated\nI decided that just basically to the Muslim Brotherhood charge because there there there's different there's varying degrees of radicalism within that organizes eight and ... where was he on the spectrum he\nWas some version of a fellow traveler in other words he says simply he saw them as a legitimate part of the Arab political scene\nAnd I think he was sympathetic to Muslim Brotherhood parties in the sense that I Would think he was basically one of these people and and there are lots of them who is basically a liberal but who sees the Brotherhood as a core part of our democracy it stopped my point of view but it's not a ... an\nIllegitimate eccentric or extreme point of view it's a legitimate perspective\nAnd one of those things that started to float around and was retweeted by none other than Donald Trump junior was a photo of Mr ... D with Osama bin Laden that rattling around Afghanistan ends yes yes and he was somehow in El ... sympathize\nRunning around Afghanistan and just somehow in El ... synthesized said what what's the story behind that\nWell that is that is a really great example of how disgusting this has become because\nAt no point in his life was ... and all ... to sympathize or or a believer in violence or terrorism he did begin his career as many journalists young journalists um both Arabs and and Americans that at the time did covering the war in Afghanistan\nAnd as a as a young Saudi journalist he was able to get in with this new breed of people\nWho at the time we called Arab ass guns or or you know sort of Arab part of the job he did\nA and then eventually some of them more students who becoming a hide the fact that he was covering that partly makes\nHim a sympathizer and the great irony of course is that these people got going and they were in Afghanistan and doing what they were doing because the United states was encouraging them to do it any arms that they had came from the United states and but ... essentially involved in an American covert war\nSo what's behind this you can eat you raise the question why several times why is because there are people who know that the background to this or this is to discredit set so why why are they doing it\nI think that the whole point here and it's really disgusting is to try to mitigate the sense of outrage about what's happened to an end to kind of say in a very round about way\nThat this isn't all that bad because he was either not a journalist but an activist or even a spirit or and he was not a liberal he was in Islam is or even an extremist and the terrorists or something you know those are the kind of progression\nOf absurdity that you get and anywhere you go in this direction I think he was intended to make people feel less alarmed less horrified less angry and to reach\nMake people feel less alarmed less horrified less\nAngry and to recast says as less of an outrage you know this is not the time and moment to have a debate about ... complex political opinions on that would have been before he was killed or a long time after the cases resolved\nRight now the only thing we can be gained by it's frankly is to try to imply that it's not that big a deal and I find that horrible\nI Wonder who who the target is because the same time we have seen a Donald Trump said that journalists at the enemy the people he praised politician for having a ... a journalist so obviously there is no love lost their so who was the intended target for this\nI think the intended audience is people on the right of the American spectrum or others who are primed to thanks very badly about the Muslim Brotherhood maybe supporters\nOf Israel people on the Christian right intense secularists which you could put me in that last kept but still the point is that I think that there's an idea\nThat ... is being misrepresented\nBeing cast as a better person than he was which is ridiculous but I think that's the idea and that people who can really learn what he actually thought\nWe'll thinking again about how bad this was that age it really infuriating and they're not all lives like any good\nConspiratorial urban legend there's a grain of truth in parts of it but uh I think the only thing that can be gained right now by getting into it is to make people care less about the fact\nThat he's gone missing and probably dead\nDoes this indicate though that how much they are worried about this story and about the the impact there's a lot of people worried about how big it\nThis story and about the the impact is a lot of people worried about how big an impact is the art and science I Would imagine\nThat they don't want the United states to overreact and certainly there are pro Israel voices who do not want the United states to become\nToo strange from Saudi Arabia I Want to keep the heat on Iran and want to make sure that this doesn't mess that up and I actually think that's a very important project but I I think that these are two different matters you know nothing should justify people's sense of outrage about this a heinous atrocity\nWe let me that there will be following this time is it they think\nYou're very welcome Hussein ... has known Jamal ...
