Susan Collins speaking earlier today democratic Senator Joe Manchin also declared he would vote confirmed judge Kavanaugh as he explained his decision to reporters he was drowned out by protesters\nAnd I looked at me and I make a decision based on what you see that at a photo investigation by the it was from I sat there was a lot\nOf people that I was concerned about how they said what they say how they did a\nDemocratic Senator Joe Manchin\nDemocratic Senator Joe Manchin Gen ... is a senior ... politics reporter for huff post we reached her in Washington DC\nBut they have suggested that they want to deport Hassan to Syria\nIf they did proceed with the charges that he would stay and remind wouldn't be so they would uh they they wanted to vote\nYeah if if they had pursued the criminal charges strangely it would've been better for 'em because um he we would have had time to try and figure out how to protect him\nWhat would happen to him if he was deported in Syria he what what does he believe would occur\nWhile he would definitely be imprisoned because he is wanted because he does not complete who's mandatory military service he has very clearly you know state and\nBecause he does not complete who's mandatory military service he has very clearly you know stayed into objections to the civil war that's happening in Syria\nAnd he has been quite critical of the Assad regime which means that he would just may be imprisoned probable that he would be tortured it could be even worse\nYou and others have been trying to stop this deportation and in fact try to bring him to Canada for all of these months and he has been in the airport so what happened to your efforts\nWell waste a map okay Shane a call to sponsor Hassan to come to Canada we raised over twenty thousand dollars\nSupport that sponsorship application we worked to find a fulltime job so he has a job offer which includes housing in Whistler British Columbia\nHe has for a close family members here in Canada so we had asked me to meeting government to expedite the process in time for that application and to date today have been not able or willing to do that\nIn his status of his file at this point the sun has been accepted to Canada is that right\nHints application has been approved to quote what all that means is that when we submitted it it was reviewed by a immigration a refugee inches and shipped Canada and approved yet so popular thing at that point it was sent overseas to the high commission of\nAh Canada in Singapore for processing the standard like the type of parts of sitting there is twenty three to twenty six months\nHe has said that he is willing to sit in the airport for twenty three months of that is what it takes right\nYeah that's what he said we are grateful that they have permitted him to be there for the last seven months and he was only able to survive to the generosity of airline employees who provided him with airline meal it came to the point where Malaysia felt that she could\nNeal it came to the point where Malaysia felt that she could no longer be in the airport\nYou know when we spoke with him back in April he talked about you and your efforts to help him I I just wanted to play a bit of that clip or where he talks about what you've done for him\nThey made me believe again and again when they ought to just a group of volunteers amazing people no matter what consequences will be quite ... ... or ... or ... these people are in there I'm grateful for as long as I was doing last\nThat was his own a concert talking about what you and the other Canadians have done for him\n[noise] and it's heartbreaking I you know I have never met a fun but I feel that I Know him I mean we we've gone through a lot together we've spoken on the phone recharged video compensation he has a nickname for me\nI feel like he's my son and his mother has reached out to me a and his sister to you know thank me for what I'm doing but I just I'm very scared right now but I'm also hopeful I Believe in our government I I'm just praying and hoping that they will be that\nOne of the things that um the Malaysian immigration chief said about arresting ... is that he's shamed Malaysia because of how much publicity he got that he was making these little videos and the people I was following him on Twitter about what it's like\nTo live in the airport acts of kindness acts of cruelty that he was subjected to what would it actually take at this point to go to safety\nOne signature from minister integration he just needs a what's called a temporary rent is permanent\nOne signature from minister of immigration he just needs a what's called a temporary ratcheted permanent that the minister Kenny shoes for someone who is in a ... situation which would permit Hassan to fly immediately to Canada where he could\nWait here while his sponsorship ... the process\nAnd without that signature what happens he could die it it's very it's very\nReal it's a so outside of our daily existence you know I'm a\nCanadian mom never thought that I Would be\nIn a position where I Am fighting for some of like I'm just thinking the Canadian government to step in it would be so easy we have raised on the twenty thousand dollars\nWe have six thousand signatures on a petition asking the minister of immigration to allow us to come to counter documents a fulltime job here he had for family members of the new Canada he has thousands and thousands of volunteers who are ready to welcome him they integrate them into Canadian society and uh\nI just don't understand why we can't help is young now\nCooper appreciate speaking with you and we will it will keep in touch and we'll see what happens\nThank you and I really appreciate your interest in support of Bye bye bye\nGloria Cooper is one of the group of Canadians that has been trying to help us on Oakland are come to Canada since April we reach ms Cooper in Venice\n\n\n[noise]\nYou have likely seen something like this on a map before there is a place usually an island that is small and\nQuite geographically far from the focal piece of land the center of the map and so they put this little island in a box and shifted closer to the focal point it's completely inaccurate geographically speaking but it's convenient and it makes everything just nice and come back from a design perspective\nYou've also probably spend a little to no time questioning the existence of those boxes unless you're a ... or you were from Shetland for some residents that Scottish archipelago those map boxes have been a point of frustration\nBut this week a new rule came into place that freeze their home from that two dimensional confinement\nBy banning government bodies in Scotland from putting Shetland in a box on maps the rule was proposed by Shetland politician ... Scott we reached Mr Scott in lurk Shetland\n... why did you want to get Shetland out of the box\nThe many government publications ... on\nA on the other ways in which shepherd has it'd be exhibited over the years has usually had the islands placed on a map in a book in the incorrect geographical position\nOn many islanders if not all of the island does feel pretty upset by that on were fed up with the irritation know being in the wrong place so some comments you legislation was a available earlier this year and I was able to move um some changes to that legislation\nAvailable earlier this year and I was able to move um some changes to that legislation so as to make sure that in future a shepherd dies you say has nothing to box but then it's correct position\nNow is it just because they didn't that people don't like it could hog refers I can ... is there a reason for putting in a box\nI guess the reason is there were two hundred miles across a north of all the mainland and therefore I correct pasta\nHas to have a favorite to see the north sea and the way um I don't have a problem with that because we live on islands we depend on ... we have a huge crushing industry that to you that depends on of a pristine marine environment\nThat we have the oil industry all around us as well in all the industrial mechanisms that depend on the oil use the sea so it seems to be a bit strange to have to see is part of the ... that's a reality of where we are\nTalking to a posted this band said that is not had Shetland shouldn't be there would be no new details they actually use these boxes to avoid map sitter mostly water and that you do lose so much when you have to I have to expand\nThe map that large you know I'd have shut Lyndon then\nWell hey hold my ... leaves hold them I mean they\nAre we live we live I think it's time that we were put in the right place not\nFly them does believe that it's not just my items but I think also I look throughout the world have the same a view of the use of the view these things are going\nI think it's a terribly kind of city centric come um central but as we say in the central belt constitutes which is that at ... at the center of the universe and everywhere else should just be lucky to be somewhere in the in the vicinity of I think we in check and take the view is\nAbout time that we must stop on instead of looking at it from the center I'm we looked at it from where we live that would make a change in the modern digital world we live and\nSo what you're talking to you can put Shetland in the middle and played ...\nSome change in the digital world we live in\nOkay so what you're talking to you can put Shetland in the middle and put what Great Britain in a box\nNot only was it courageous to talk about especially within her own culture and religion to talk about what had happened to her from a sexual point of view because of the taboo issues\nNot about one relevant to her it was about literally saving hook people I mean it was remarkable to meet her and her strength in her ... year Colyer determination to get these things done on behalf of hurt people and to be that voice\nYou know when he had been working on it since the I guess with international in ...\nDon on behalf of ... people and to be that voice you know when he had been working on it since the\nI guess there was International Women's day in twenty sixteen with my first question to Justin Trudeau on that day in question period asking him to create a special program to bring you the girls and women to safety in Canada and but it became apparent\nWhen ... came to Canada She heard what we were doing and she came to Canada and then it was undeniable no one could look at her and said no we don't want\nTo help the government created a program and\nShe thought she never imagined that this would have happened but she's become really a heroine to her own people into people all over the world\nI wanted to ask you about that voice that person coming into parliament and the effect it had she was what she was in the gallery when there's a ... was debated ...\nShe was sitting with my husband holding and [laughter] and where do you think it's so hard he said he will never forget when she was and that's the only time she cried I spend time with her listening\nAnd I remember that I wanted to break down so many times and I thought how could I how could I cried\nWhen she doesn't and I just held at all in and as soon as she left the house I just broke down but she was so strong I just couldn't imagine where does she find that strength I kept thinking to myself and then when we knew it was very emotional when you\nWhen parliament voted in favor chicken down and she almost physically [noise]\nMy hope for her but she won't kill and then she will find some time to heal herself I just I Want her to be happy I knew she can you know into he all and find a normal life\nOne of the significant things among all the other things you've just itemize did she did for you know the women and girls for people is the awareness she brought to the world\nThe awareness she brought to the world about rape and sexual assault as a crime of war as a weapon of war they were finally prosecutions about this and the war crimes tribunals loser board champions does\nThe recognition that these aren't just things that happened at some individual goes too far these are organized campaigns to destroy communities and cultures through destroying their young women so do you think that that is ultimately what she's brought to the world\nShe has no doubt about that and exactly what you say that rape is just a symptom of a war it's just a side effect then it just wore dirty enough and complicated and these things just happen when they don't just happen because the truth as\nRape is used as a tool of war particularly when you think of ethnic cleansing but what happened to be as eating when it was exactly that when we talk about women peace and security it shouldn't be talked about you know over here in the sand box I you know this isn't just a gender issue that we had to be you\nKnow to the subtext of a of a particular discussion around the peace process you know it should be at the center of the discussion because it's at the center of what is a big part of warfare I think what she's done his remarkable I look at her and I think\nMy goodness for someone her agent for what she went through to be able to rise up and be that folks person it's just it's remarkable\nI don't know if you've had a chance to speak with an audio ... have you talked to her he reached out to\nHer I did I Know right away in London Simon I thought the b._b._c. headline a little earlier than Canadians did and I just want\nTo think of let out a big help of glee and central know right away telling your how incredibly proud of him or her and all of us every one is and that she was just so well preserved\nAnd all of that everyone is going to cheat it just so out there I'm sure she getting many many messages like that from around the world\nReally appreciate speaking with you thank you\nThank you Keli because you buy at night\n[noise] Ron Ambrose is of course former interim leader of the conservative party we reached her in London, UK and later on in the program we're going to look back at carols twenty twelve

Jason Van Dyke shot ... McDonald sixteen times\nHe said he was afraid of the Seventeen year old because he was holding a knife but when footage of the incident was finally released its Van Dyke storey fell apart because for one thing even after the Seventeen year old had fallen to the street the officer continued to shoot him\nWell today a jury found Jason Van Dyke guilty of second degree murder in the shooting of liquid McDonald it is the first time in nearly fifty years at a Chicago police officer has been convicted for an on duty shooting\nAfter that verdict people outside the courthouse celebrated and chanted justice for ... Jamal Greene was there we reached Mr ...\nChanted justice for ... Jamal Greene was there we reach Mr green in Chicago\nIs to green what was the reaction outside when the verdict came down\nWhile we were relieved that he was found guilty on a second degree murder as well as each count of aggravated battery I'm mad that he wasn't you know convicted of an officer and misconduct because of course he still has an appeal\nBut we really bad a statement was made today to officers all across the country is that you can't continue being a judge jury and executioner\n... when you say relieved did you think it would go the other way\nWhile you know ... if you look in America\nWhen officers go on trial they always get off the majority of them get off you know you rarely see officers actually getting convicted so it was do we expect it you know we we were expecting a not guilty verdict respected him to go home expecting them to put on another\nA police uniform [noise] I'm In the end of the day we are glad that that did not happen\nSay when you say that there there have been I guess I'm thinking about what happened and to a police officer in Dallas who was sentenced to prison in the summer for murder and ah there have been some other cases Oklahoma New York city so\nDo you think is the tide tuning or are these cases said I didn't to changing because humans are a lot of their their shootings that didn't go this way\nNow know about trying to we've got a lot of work that they're okay we can't stop now we've got to make sure that the criminal justice system works we've got to make sure that we have good state's attorney said good attorney general sense um [noise]\nPeople that are well make up the criminal justice system to be fair you know we need a judge's set off the bars you know we don't have many a black or Hispanic judges and the and the cook county and and as a Cook County courts\nDon't have many a black or Hispanic judges and the and the cook county and and as a Cook County court you know we have to make sure the criminal the criminal justice system is made up of people who\nCare to do what's right and the two we have that and we don't have anything um we just have small when along the way but we we kinda got lucky\nWhen do you think it was about the evidence that convinced the jury\nWhile you know I think that\nYou know the fact that no other officer to stars a weapon and he got out of his car with them six seconds and he was already firing round the fact that he lived on the stand\nAnd acted like the wind was coming towards him play 'cause park showing no remorse\nReally acted like everything they feel is right you know they look at those witnesses a witness testimony helped as well so I mean I think that he did horrible on the stand in the state to turn to rip them apart I Want to give the state's attorney um\nBanks are bad and uh you know I appreciate the great work that they have done to this place um because I think that they've done it a job um and they looked at the end the jury looked at all of that evidence and looked at a\n... Jason Van Dyke testimony which now is that we're hearing that a few jury said that that was why they decided he was guilty\nOr maybe it wasn't good for him to take the stand\nHis testimony was ... was that this way to defend his guilt that the video itself can you describe the video and the effect it had on his years in in the ... and like likelihood\nI mean if you look at the video and you see you see someone that shot fall to the ground and you see air smoke\nWhen you see you see someone that shot fall to the ground and you see air smoke\nAre more bullets and I think the video is very ... I think the jury thought so as well is that why would you keep shooting I think if he didn't shot shoot the Koran as many times\nIt's possible he could have got off the shot and shot him one time he possibly could have gotten off I had a very a small charge 'em but I think it was the fact that he kept shooting those sixteen ... why would you keep shooting him", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Reno", "day": "06"}
