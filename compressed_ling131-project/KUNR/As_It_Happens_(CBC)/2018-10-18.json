but now it makes it all the difference of the world because anybody who says to me who drove the newer this that well\nThat's what we found and we took a we we did our own censuses of the unknown\nWould be in decline as well [noise]\nThat's what we found and we took a we we did our own senses of the Enola S. lizard populations I'm In the study area which I had done in the seventies but also we were very fortunate to have publicly available data from the very day long term ecological research program\nAnd many many field biologist had contributed to that database of\nBird abundances frog abundances all over the past Thirty years so we we looked at those and they told the story of the upper levels of the food Web there wasn't de to decline significant decline and birds in the frogs\nAnd uh in parallel with the decline in their food\n[noise] it just I guess they knew the way to register how how consequential you research is is that scientists who have read it they were responding to what you published are in shock that this is around the world and extremely disturbing a research report that you have\nReleased and and it ... and Lucy this everywhere we're seeing declines of all kinds of\nAnimals and and ... the food chain why is it so much more significant in spite of Puerto Rico well\nThat's a great question you know I like insects are declining globally um frogs\nHad been crashing and going extinct for the past Fifteen to Twenty years\nThat's thought to be primarily a fungus infection but the consequences\nI think are so somewhat unexpected of our study in that if it's replicated and we'd need more data keep telling everyone that but it's true on these are complex systems we just did a little kid or rain forest um their indicators and in Mexico in the tropical forest\nTrue um these are complex systems we just did a little kid a rain forest um their indicators and in Mexico on the tropical dry forests that Andres than I studied before\nThat a similar declines of insects as occurring but we need more data um so the implications however are truly frightening because this has been overlooked central a phenomenon that has\nProfound implications for the future of tropical rain forest\nIf the insects are found to be decreasing and other tropical forests and we are getting the effects on the food Web that we noticed in Puerto Rico then that is a major major another major negative\nComponent for the future\nOf by a diversity and the preservation of of systems um I think it was unexpected it's a\nIt's a rather unknown effect in tropical rain forest because people don't measure insects in them like that's just been true I think they just take it for granted it's the tropics they're warm they're doing fine may be logging um in some cases now pesticides would have an effect but not this kind of\nExtreme collapse\nAnd so why why why do you think is happening in ... yes well\nTen years ago actually colleagues of our our as a ... um they predicted that tropical insects would be exquisitely sensitive\nTo increases in temperature and that was counter intuitive for many biologists including myself because just think oh wait a second they evolved in hot arguments how they're going to be\nAffected by a couple of degrees of warning but they showed that tropical insects have a very narrow range of thermal tolerance\nFor that was their predictions is borne out many laboratory experience parents but Andre ... and I went down to Puerto Rico to see if it was truly happening in the tropical rain forest and as far as we can tell the story chewy predictions had been borne out\nThe story chewy predictions have been born out\nBad I it's just devastating to have this News I'm glad you went there and fight back this research
