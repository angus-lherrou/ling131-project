Indonesia when he discovered the elusive animal Mr Smith also shot to wonder why he spotted but only with a camera we reached Michael Smith in foreign them surgery England\nIs just misses you know there's been no record inciting as they want to treat kangaroo since Nineteen twenty eight so how does it feel to be the first person in Ninety years to report having seen this animal\nA surprising um it's a bit of a responsibility of culture because uh you know less weight they got some kind of conservation problems sorted out a lot on the little ... but they promise to\nMine and the one day one mountains and the continuing demand so stuffed trophy specimens Cy ... author hype but it's not the same\nHow did you discover how did you see the streak anger\nBut that they are they for looking for um Iraq for the right to Denver and I'm In the mountains of how can you can a and a Indonesia in West Africa and I was looking at least be pumps I'm One of the wonder why not\nPopular New Guinea and ah the Indonesian less popular and I was looking for new species of pumps I'm wants to see the wonder why mountains or they had a few days though and I'll just Google the name of this kind of grew up I didn't see it but I decided I bought a comeback for a look another expedition or the or the next year\nAnd how did you is it just by chance or did you see it right away or I just tells the story of how you finally did see this animal\nOut to get a lot of time at some get permission from the bugs will thought isn't the traditional London now um spend ten days in the mountain forest\nVery tough going but hot the guy's a strike ... I'm a local hunter who um eventually I'll sit down and move for us um actually I only saw the the tree hungry kind of a last hour of the last day before we had to give up some pack up and go down the mountain\nAnd so this is the guy who was the ... as somebody from ... west ... who identified this is possibly the unreal looking for\nNew about trade Congress but he'd never seen one before because no one's actually\nBeing quite so high and the mountains I don't think um people hunger for another faceless ... down when the forces a bit more open but when you got above about\nA free thousand four thousand feet you got these really done spam booth tickets with enough they pointed creep is not there's not much in the way of water flowing so yeah it it was it was almost the kind of a a legend I'm even political ...\nNow in Nineteen twenty eight when Ernes to Meyer saw this animal what he did in order to do the research is he shot the creature 'em dead but to took the Palestine sent it back to the natural history museum in London to have evaluated so I'm presuming you did not do that\nOr do things that China's a or the or the rules of toughened up on on how to say no I don't know how to play by play\nNice things or China or something or or the or the rules of toughened up on on how to say no I had the ... which\nWas almost as difficult as what mine would have a hot that they um maybe a if we can get a proper expedition together\nSometime next year we can collect some of the ah the tree congregate dung and take it away for DNA Analysis because we've called a DNA from the original specimen that I've seen in the natural history museum in London\nAnd that would just confirmed what I ...

hundreds of miles from the the the Smoky Mountains which is where the uh the nearest relatives of the uh wonder white tree Congress found Sunday yeah not many people had out though\nAnd we have seen this speech instead but you have to do something to certify your your discovery is it is it for sure what you have seen is this is this ... most wanted last species or or or how does\nA lot of coal fought it and I thought much about for Congress like sign up to five times and descriptions to some of the topics but most of the fake hunger that's a couple of small stray there was a guy and said here's a thought in the ninth piece of work on the genetics I'm he told me it was the most exciting news he'd he'd had him yes but um\nEnormous kind of a electrical show I thought it was electric cars\nAnd after\nThe second electric could show I suppose is sick of it so he didn't believe that you're talking about bullets being fired into your body aren't\nThat fight from behind then I read

to them that phone all the hospital's been shot\nOff to the British I was told that it was the closest somehow that the man who shocked me go some time to get the way\nHe also served by one young lady and she also trade that see news from the house and inform\nAlso afraid that the news from the house and informed the only three weeks later\nDid you immediately once you learn that you had been shot was that your assumption right away and it was because he had this summer is\nWhat will happen in the hospital I was told was that one though the doctors are hundreds of\nRead the ... have you read the book I understood that impulse that it was me the perversion so then that the law was given of their most too late may be a no or maybe two hours today\nSo a\nProperly or the people who we are involved either have the Charles to get hit me in a certain empathy or had pasta border or had left the\nCity and Simpson was that you were a victim of crime that they didn't realize it was an assassination until much later\nThat Dr understood it made the the other public you know understood that he made the rest of the police wanted to be cheaper shoes that that didn't do do the same is fake as a police officer and said they did this whole whole will just hold their knees\nMany people's lives were changed including synonymous days did how did that change your life all these years after the the city\nI I must say that you know that this is a ... that's the way it reminds me I'd be about to happen then I was shocked but ... says he has been fine because I\nKept that this is a whole has not made the same time there's no case and but that principle which is empty seats\nNot made the same time ... so but that principal ... which is empty the important which I also want to underline that should be the fact that decision\nDo you ever regret that you published a book\nNow that's part of a job\nYou said that is part of your campaign also for free speech\nThat's your job as popular as a ... that is part of the job like that you in the media has to do this and\nI Know you're just about to get your getting up to the area I Know you've landed someplace I just ask you one last quick question do you think that said panic versus will be published today here in this political environment yes\nIt does I mean it's ... you would have done it yeah All right well I that's that's very admirable Mr need God I Know you you got to get going so I appreciate talking machines [laughter] and we'll be following the case thank you so much by by by by\nWilliam the guard is the chair of the Norwegian chapter of the freedom of expression advocacy group and you can find more on his story on our website CBC dot CA slash as it happens\nIn San ... twenty twelve ... Joseph and on he described Mr new guards decision and the decisions of others like him to publish the Satanic Verses as quote one of the greatest defense is a free speech of our time unquote\nIn September of at your Carol asked Mr roof devote his decision to go forward with a Satan versus in the face of so much fundamentalist outrage\nKnow I think there was some huge principles at stake I mean freedom of speech is not just a cliche or I mean it's it's something without which will\nIt's something without which all of the freedoms disappear it's the bedrock of a free society and a force it needs to be defended and so of course another principle is not to succumb to tyrannical bullying by anybody\nWhat sport because it's the first time I've read and I understood what the threats were what you were being warned about when can you describe what was that there\nWas a very simply the reason I was offered police protection was because the intelligence services in England their analysis was that there was a very high probability that I Would be the target of the state sponsored terrorist attack\nOrganized by professional assassins in the employee of another state which is a state of Iran and they said it's because you are under attack from another state that the British states feels it has to defend against that attack and that was the only reason\nAnd these were in fact death squads there they knew that the Iranian government had issued with orders to find it really is\nThat's correct and there was several moments during this period of of of the protection when I was informed that they the police of the intelligence services believed that wasn't such squad or maybe more than one such squad had entered the country\nIn order to carry out the threats and uh yeah I Do think that it's true that because I wasn't killed there are people who think that nobody has tried to kill me\nPeople who think that nobody has tried to kill me and I read that it was somehow me liking to have all this all this protection the noise around me that some of my ego was driving it\nFor you even had one life at the time now ex wife who perpetuated that that this\nTo yes it didn't help 'em I Hope she's ashamed that I bet she's not\nThat they will [noise] um I only have to remind you that other people were attacked that you know the bookstores in North America in England that will bomb sometimes more than once\nThey were endless threats against people in publishing companies of bookstores [noise] you know my Italian translator was was knifed and beaten and only I mean fortunately survived\nMy Japanese translates was murdered his University in an elevator my Norwegian publisher who was shot three times in the back\nAnd my miracle survived a lot just survived the beta full recovery was crippled you know this was actually happening\n[noise] he said at the end that it's hard to say what it is the bachelor the seed panic versus ended in victory or defeat life\nWell if you look at it merrily then yes I think we didn't do so badly as to say there was an attempt to suppress and all the novel is available in whatever it is forty eight forty nine languages [noise] there was an attempt to suppress the also when you're sitting here talking to so if you look at it to that level\nSo if you look at it to that level then yeah it was a willful fights at the end and and I managed to achieve a thing that for a very long time I didn't believe I Would achieve which is that normalization of my life and also in ... one of the publishing of the book\nBut if you will broadly are the kind of chilling effect of that event\nI think the worst one and is one I think uh people meeting people in the publishing industry\nAre very wary of getting involved with the forces of radical Islam now and I think there's a degree of reluctance to publish anything which smacks at all of a criticism of Islam or or even a voucher Islam\nSo that's a longer awful I think a a ... which is absolutely don't one the only ... ray of hope I can find\nIs that uh I guess three years ago it was the twentieth anniversary of the ... and they interviewed a lot of the western leaders would be an active in the battle against the book and I think with with no exceptions all of them said that they felt it it'd be the mistake they shouldn't have done it\nAt some of them said that the tactical reasons they said that it could backfire on the community that he's had made the community more unpopular and hadn't really getting them anything as far as the laundries just consider just made it more famous and made him a lot more money so they shouldn't have done it with other people actually seem to have\nAccepted the free speech arguments in a note and said that\nThe free speech arguments and said that they understood that either they would be allowed to say what they would have said was wrong with them to try to prevent other people from say things that they didn't like so that's what got you interested in Twenty years later the bullets everybody who had been involved in leading the campaign against the book\nHad come to the conclusion that it'd be a bad thing\nFrom our
