knew all about his contract he talks about confidentiality and he talks about penalties a he has been rather cavalier in in terms of throwing around numbers\nThat these things I Want to ask you about that because the prime minister says he's prevented from offering ...\nPrime minister says he's prevented from offering details but that there would be penalties in the billions if you cancel the contract what's your understanding of what the true price would be\nI don't know I have never been given any access to the contract\nUm but um he knows what is in that contract and I think that people should also recall that there's only a year left in the contract so the question is how many vehicles are are still to be shipped what is the nature of the vehicles were not even sure that they're all labs\nAnd the fact that he knows he has the terms are confidential but she knows on Monday he said it was going to be a billion dollars on Wednesday he said oh well I'm a billion dollars a was just a figure of speech\nAnd now he's saying possible penalties and the billions a thorough so um it it's very very unclear\nBut what is clear to me is that\nAs signers of the international arms trade treaties\nWe have an obligation not to sell to human rights defenders and the world is going to come after us and and make us live up to ... now at the same time these workers must be protected and I want to see a transition I Want to see something in black and white that is not confidential\nFrom this prime minister in regard to how he is going to protect these workers and make sure that they have the ability to support their families\nIf there's only a year ago and only so many left some of these armored vehicles to deliver what makes you so confident it's worth paying the price and the the the billions and penalties\nWhat price would you pay on\nThe billions and penalties\nWhat price would you pay on twelve million lives called me and people are expected to perish in the next year because of this war that the Saudis are waging we have to stand up and say uh this is wrong\nNow earlier this year though you weren't calling for those expert permits to be canceled you wanted them to be slowed down ... how did your mind changed on that\nWell I'm In terms of um what what was going on I think that there needed to be clarity and it's interesting\nTalking you know what was going on in Yemen yet what was going on in Yemen and there have been reports over the last a while and speaking with um\nWith representatives from General Dynamics\nThey kept assuring that they had close contact that they actually went and inspected what was going on in Saudi Arabia and they were sure that there wasn't anything on toward a but clearly a that is\nI guess more hopeful than a than a than truth so\nWell can I just that's just so is it not somewhat naive to believe that when you're shipping these armored vehicles to whatever country that they will always be used for peace making purposes\nI think it depends on who your customer is and in this case it's a very unreliable customer if we were to find a customers among our NATO allies those who\nAbsolutely a do not commit to a human rights offenses then we could feel a lot better in terms of of how those vehicles were being used\nA lot better in terms of how those vehicles for being used and I want to come back\nTo what I said initially is you're probably the best vehicles in the world in terms of peace keeping keeping peace keepers safe and that a wise I think always the intent in terms of fat after work ... they saw this as

inactive list we were being sent that those illegally we moved within the same county\nAnd sign up count on staff and you challenge and how did you challenge it\nActually because I was so the stress

you say is Georgia's secretary of state and the Republican candidate for governor he strongly denies that he's attempting to suppress the vote in any way what's your response to him\nMy response to him would be let's have a conversation because there are questions about my case than simply do not fit the rhetoric that he would like us to believe I was not in an active voter but\nI Need to know why was targeted because the only thing I can think of I Am black I Am female and I tend to vote democratic\n[noise] well it's been widely reported that people most affected by this are and like you

just Georgia this has become a part of this\nOver throughout the country not just George Bush has become a partisan battle\nAnd there's under touch any message that we as Americans can say to anybody
