years ago there was a military dictatorship\nYou may have seen it after all the video has been viewed online more than six point six million times and the two weeks since it was posted a young female activist walks up to a male passengers on the St Petersburg metro and pours e bleach solution onto their crotch is from a plastic bottle\nTheir crime she says is man spreading justice or an overreaction broadly most people felt that fell into one of those two categories\nBut actually it belongs to a third category according to an e anti disinformation website this video was staged and it is crumbling propaganda Nikolai nickel\nIt is crumbling propaganda ... is a reporter and a video producer with mashable dot com because I first of all what kind of on line reaction and comments has this video provoked\nWell first of all before people figure it out of there was a ... video it received quite a substantial\nCoverage in terms of western media everybody was jumping on sort of the ... of a you know there's a woman in Russia\nActually as a in preparation for the you know just open Google and I and I rode viral spreading video I just wanted to see which ... which article that are going to be first and actually you can still see\nThat the majority of the articles in the Google Search or remain the the video that don't know that it's it's actually a stage a stage process or or said process so that's actually quite interesting\nHow do you know it said ... what would what was the evidence that was presented that say that this was a fake story and that this man's betting thing was just staged\nI first watched it what is really strange that the female blogger in individual the female blogger that's talking about this and that staging this a protest\nHas been known in Russia to do this in the past but unlike this uh particular video she has\nBrought a serious issue is like a you know ups courting and other forms of you know sexual assault that women in Russia and faith and what what struck me about this video that the tone was very different and it was almost the grass isn't the way that she was approaching so called men spreading a people on on the subway and it it just seemed a little bit off in how she\nWas trying to prove a point about an issue like men sprinting which was on an entirely different ballpark to ups courting once the article on the eve this information came out the evidence that they give\nFor being fake and that he was actually published by a an outlet that's owned by Russia Today which is uh\nBeing fake it that he was actually published by a an outlet that's owned by Russia Today which is a you know a media outlet that directly owned by the Kremlin or the outlet it's cold in the now which used to be shown on the arts website which is now its own sort of vertical\nAnd it's quite popular on Facebook that's where the the video that when most viral was posted and that fact that he actually still is on line or there are other versions of the video that were posted on YouTube where have not been taken down but the original video\nA Facebook video is actually still on Facebook and I think at the time that I checked it had like six million views [laughter]\nI wasn't do part of the debunking that uh the men who are in it because if people haven't seen the video\nMen are sitting man's betting on a subway their legs are a part she's next to them or standing about them she pours this liquid onto their laps they look startled as such but how did we come to know that these were actors who are paid\nThere's there's an online magazine in ... in St Petersburg called ... and uh they\nPosted some interviews with one of the men who appeared and video who said that he was actually page and subsequently other other testimonies of people of men in the video were posted online on social media thing uh you know the day appeared in the video and they were a couple of\nPaid actors and I think ... posts was you know you you come in for a job with welfare continue and you leave with money in your pocket [noise]\nUm and then what will you know once once to sort of the investigation got a little bit deeper it turned out that potentially get this video was filmed by um\nBy a studio that that are known to have worked with Archie and with the Kremlin end up in the past\nSo the connections become you know more and more clear that the deeper you look\nWhy would this be of interest as Kremlin propaganda why what what's why why this sounds like a a not a large\nBut again why what what's why why this sounds like a a not a large issue for the state government why why would they they've helped to fund something like this\nIt's it's one of it it's it's sort of like one of many uh issue said they tried to sort of like\nSport debate and and and sort of their anger and the reason why we were talking about it's just they got caught and that's the thing that I think it's different now than\nLet's say two or three years ago and uh what the video was basically trying to do is is trying to show how a woman is you know is going too far she's being aggressive in in sort of protecting her so called you know in in quotation marks or\nHer feminist sort of philosophy in and eat\nThat only goal is to do is to store I'm anti feminist sentimentality in in in people around the world particularly people in the west but it's also you know once this goes back to Russia you know and allow politicians\nFor example to it's a talking point where they can go back and then sort of\nSupport into more conservative parts of the country I think there was one politician one uh from from putting his party who said really nasty things about this uh activists in about ten minutes and journals so it allows them to to actually bring back\nCertain points about how important is to keep a conservative society and to how we shouldn't be like misled by liberal or a radical liberal sort of ideas like feminism and things like that\nWhen you said that that when you checked on line they just to now you found that to some sites don't seem to know that at stake but do you think it's more the case that they don't care that they're not talking about mainstream media but do you think that there isn't it a point now where it doesn't even matter if it's too as long as it's effective\nYes um I think I think so I don't know if it well I don't know if the desired effect of actually achieved I Know that the the the article that they use this for mission\nNo if the desired effect is actually achieved I Know that the the the article that uh you ... uh I added a comment that had fourteen thousand likes to us as sort of proof that people are are getting kind of enraged by this or by the staging act and the day that it potentially has started some feminist a sentiment but I\nTo be honest I think we shouldn't place too much emphasis on on these kinds of attempt at propaganda they they are there are plenty fall and they exist across confident in in in in Europe and in in the U.S I don't think\nThere are sort of like a start to worry too much about these kinds of a temperature that that the the Kremlin is attempting you know different kinds of propaganda\nA disinformation campaign than it it it's sort of a hit or miss rather than a or a central a central I sort of a strategy\n[noise] All right we'll leave it there ... thank you thank you Glenn ... is a reporter and a video producer with a mashable dot com we reached him in London, UK we have more on this story on our website CBC dot CA slash a I

end of that for a while\nBut you got more than you bargained for didn't you\nCall it a lot more than I bargained for I got a notification just a couple of months ago that I had a family member that I had no idea even existed\nNon what did you think when you got the notification\n[noise] oh so many thoughts going through my head basically I was in shock\nI was done um I felt almost nauseous was there a mistake could this be a mistake but DNA doesn't lie I mean DNA is DNA so I figured I actually have\nA sister and I wanted to explore a bit further is that I told you you had to you had the sister wrote their\nInitial notification that a close family member and I got her name when I logged into ancestry DNA I got her name and I was curious because I had no idea who this girl was that with the post\nHer name when I logged into ancestry DNA about her name and I was curious because I had no idea who this girl was that was supposedly a close family member\nAnd I decided to send a message through the ancestry website because as I said I had her name but I didn't know who she was and I reached out to her and said pretty much a who argue and took off from there\nNow ice itself
