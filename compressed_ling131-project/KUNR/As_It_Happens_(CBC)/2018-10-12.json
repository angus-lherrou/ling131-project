John we don't like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people think\nIt's Donald Trump

him in San Antonio Texas\nCongressman can say we just heard President Trump said there that he's looking for answers to Mr ... disappearance what would you like him to say that the Saudis\nWell first I Hope that he was tough on Saudi Arabia that he offers any kind of the United states helped to turkey in the investigation and ultimately I think perhaps the United States Congress and the administration should consider a treating this\nWhat happened here in the same way that we treated or the Russian operatives who in Britain um went over there and basically uh attack Russians on British soil and that means the look at the possibility of sanctions for example\nSo is this launches this ship is just as much a political statement at political action as it is a rescue mission\nI think it's first and foremost a humanitarian effort but I think it also has a\nPedagogical value as much as as political I mean I think it's important for people to recognize what the governments are doing regarding migrant rescue what governments like Italy is are blocking\nI think it also have a pet or got trouble value in another sense you know I'm In the U.S and here\nThere is a great feeling of you know not only disillusionment but powerlessness interface with non we right wing governments\nRacist policies but also a feeling of even though it's probably not completely true right wing majorities favoring them I think demonstrating that even in such situations that we can do something seems to me a really important public backed a kind of demonstration\nWe certainly know there are many Italians who ... who want to help and we've covered the stories and spoken the some of those people in bed she telling government has the support that's doing this and so are you looking for a confrontation the Italian government over this\nIs certainly not the intent\nAnd so are you looking for a confrontation of the Italian government tells it is\nCertainly not the intention of the

flag in the Mediterranean we reached him in Durham North Carolina and we have more on this story on our Web page CBC dot CA slash age [noise]\nIt was referred to as ...\n\nIt was referred to as the hardest test you've never heard of ... worked for years before they take it they often fail on their first try and on the second and third\nNo twenty three one experts who passed the masters similarly exam this fall have lost their designation the examples given by the court of master ... is a group of strips the titles because it discovered someone leaked information about the ones on the tasting exam the court has a little else about the cheating scandal [noise]\nCourtney she was always a wine journalist who worked as a ... and some of New York's top restaurants we reached her in New York\nCourtney first of all what does it mean to ... to get this title of master ...\nIt's probably the most lauded achievement that you could have in the world it's certainly not necessary for our summer yet but the people who become ... has worked for years and years to achieve this goal\nAnd then to lose the people you have been talking with a lost is what what did they say to you\nI mean it's really devastating I have to say everyone I've spoken to let you still in a lot of shock um and they're really surprised because something like this has never happened before and I actually considering that twenty three of the twenty four\nMaster some way to pass this year had work to pass this tasting portion it's usually the most difficult\nPiece of the mattress only a to pass so it's really just been devastating not only for them but for the entire white ...\nAnd the exam is notoriously regrets all three parts of it which is I guess there is a knowledge based part there is a practical part and then there is is most difficult part which is that the tasting\nThe good parts and then there is is most difficult part which is that the tasting portion of the exam just described for people what it entails\n[noise] yeah absolutely the masses only exam\nIs the highest of four levels that you can achieve within the quarter master ... so you have to pass your introductory certified and advanced exam which can take several years to pass\nSo by the time that you get your masters only exam first you have to pass Erie a separate date and then on a later date you have both a practical exam a service exam which also includes questions that you may be given on the floor as ... as well as the tasting exam which is\n... that you must blind taste in twenty five\nTwenty five minutes six wines you're blindfolded or you're you're you're you can't see what you're doing and you have to identify what\n[noise] so you're not blindfolded you can see the winds in front of you it's usually three white and three red\nBut you must go through each of the wind systematically assess the site the aromas and the ... of the line and then based on what you're tasting you must come to a conclusion on where the wind is from what the great variety is and what vintage the wine is from as well\nWhen you consider the they say that most people blindfold who can't tell the difference between white wine and red wine is is really extraordinary would be up to no\nYeah absolutely\nAnd so this part of the exam versus the part that has been called into question what exactly happened\nSo we really don't know the quarter master suddenly is America's has not released too much information on what specifically happen all we've been told is that a current master ... released information that was pertinent to the tasting flights of the exam so we don't know what's\nThat a current master ... released information that was pertinent to the tasting flights\nOf the exam so we don't know if that was before during or after the exam because the candidates are never told what the winds are even after the exam we don't know if they reveal the identity them the wind if they just gave them some clues as to what might be on the exam we really don't know and they have\nNot release any additional information about that\nWhere they cancelled the exam results of the taste portion or the whole exam\nJust the tasting portion and they have a invalidate the results for everybody so that means is that everyone who took the tasting portion of the exam whether they passed or failed now has the opportunity to reset the exam\nWhat did the people who did the exam what did they go sue to get to the point where they were doing this test\nI mean it is a huge time and financial investment this study for the masters on my exam but particularly the tasting portion of the exam because you have to taste a lot of wind in order to be able\nTo pass this exam I Know that in the film this on film that came out a few years ago some estimated that they spent as much as twenty thousand dollars\nOn wind to taste throughout the year before their exam\nAnd the person who is suspected of having given this confidential information to those taking the tests some ... whatever he or she went through to get there is this is a huge risk for me to lose a lot that's been last year I Would imagine\nAbsolutely one I've spoken to other master ... for the piece that I wrote in seven fifty daily they really were boggled at why somebody would want to cheat the system because it is such a high honor why would they then want to undercut the name by ...\nSuch a high honor why would they then want to undercut the name by giving someone out information that allows them to cheat the exam\nYou know when we're trying to get someone to talk to us about this ah people refuse to do an interview ... ah said they just didn't want to talk ... you agreed does that surprise you that so many people don't want to even discuss this\n[noise] it doesn't surprise me that those who had gained the title of master ...\nAnd now we're having taken away from them it doesn't surprise me that they don't want to talk at this point because I think for many the emotions are still raw and they also so badly want to keep this title that they want to think before they say anything publicly because one day they may be members\nAgain in this organization for me I feel confident speaking about it both as a former some way and also because I had spoken to others and I would like to give voice to them if they cannot do so themselves\nAnd one of them that you're giving voice to you who you quoted in the article one of the ... who lost their certificate or this person so do I know this is not the intent but I feel like a marker I'm embarrassed do I did nothing wrong\nThat the courts can't into the er during the legislative process is that what they're saying\n'cause that's what they're saying but I I totally disagree with that I totally disagree because one is the last time any legislation has been overturned that impact the parents' rights of our people never and you know it's a lot of lip service that they do a very good at it when the liberal government came into power prime\nMinister Justin Trudeau said\nThe lip service that they do a very good at it when the liberal government came into power prime\nMinister Justin Trudeau said the most important relationship that he wants to have is with the first nations while that's nothing but lift the ... the the that the liberal government has a give us a nothing but lip service to\nThe elections coming soon they're going to come back and are trying to get support from a first nations chances are first nations are are going to get stronger and get together and and not support a liberal\nGovernment and the the relationship right now is a it's a it's damage or is it true parable well describe your work needs to be done on on on a part of a the federal government whoever's in power\nWhat is it you want them to do and and this is not just in this case that they say in the development of what's below the poverty level in Alabama had what are you trying to stop them from developing and or or what what level do you want to see an end in in incidents and\nWe want to be part of a of this uh the development we want to be part so that it's manageable that they don't have the green light to start to destroy our land and and destroyed a fish habitat and\nOur waterways and ah we we we want to have a say in what goes on and\nThrough our rates that are supposed to be protected\nBy the federal government to make sure that we have something to go forward with for for many years to come and who we've never been heard we've uh you know the two thousand and five case was a minister uh\nSee the cops are department kind of take a plans we reach houses and then we won that Supreme Court so you think that this one should have been easier to make for for ... court\nUh I feel that the Supreme Court judges or didn't want to make that decision based on whether they get a backlash\nJudges or didn't want to make that decision based on whether they get a backlash from a from the rest of Canada and the federal government doesn't matter who which which are parties in power\nThey've always kept a the general public in a dark they don't let them know that they're part of the treaty and that uh they're benefiting more from the tree you didn't know the first patients are\nAsked at the beginning when you go from here I've seen gotten the Supreme Court ruling on this that national chief ... in saying that where it takes you is into the carts over and over again that this is just going to be lots of court cases lots ... as as lily years lots of consultations this is this is the teacher\nWell let's just put it this way\nJust wait and see what happens because uh I don't think we we have any faith any court system in in this country anymore and uh you know things are going to change and a half in really a don't speak for the nation's I'm very saddened at the national chief\nWould be working closely with uh I not to try to push a there are ... agenda\nTo basically erode our treaty rich so uh I I have no uh I have no faith\nIn the in the system today ... says you're
