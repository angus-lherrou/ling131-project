paying for that you've\nCan you I Know this is is is painful that you've you've spoken about it I'm a great deal I just want to know if you take us back to what you understand happened that night in September two thousand and\nFind out what happened was this lady who had been our son's friends on the wife for a few months only she decided to take our son's life and\nIt was only after a lot of meticulous planning over a period of time or along with several other people that she made the plan and then next year the plan\nHe was supposed to appear as though a robbery then had gone bad\nYes that was supposed to have been your parents and\nIn fact during the middle of the the assault she actually talked to the murder and reminded him that he should give her a glance on the on the on the other cheek so that you could appear to be there she was involved\n\nThe current us presidents tends to repeat himself and one of the things that he has repeated over and over and over again is how he is a quote self made billionaire [noise]\nWell a New York times investigation offers a somewhat different perspective it reveals that Mr Trump received four hundred and Thirteen million US dollars from his father's real estate empire\nMost of it because he helped his family dodge taxes [noise]\nTwo years ago reporters Suzanne Craig a Canadian was mailed to Mr Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax returns she told us he had possibly avoided paying federal taxes for Eighteen years but now the times is reporting that Mr Trump participated in outright fraud\nWe reached Suzanne Craig in New York City\nSuzanne you put out a trade or what do you up to\nNew York city Suzanne you put\nOut a tweet or what you up to last night as you waited for this story to be printed in today's paper what did you do\nAfter a after we were finished at work I went out to a depressed New York times press plant in Queens and I watch the uh the story that we wrote roll off the process\nSo we last time we spoke a couple of years ago you received a brown paper ... in which you had a part of Donald Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax return and from that you were able to extrapolate a lot of information but since then\nYou have found other streams of documents to describe what you would not do in the past two years what you have an earth since then\nSure we continue to look at 'em Donald Trump's taxes off for the story that we rode in two thousand and sixteen where we got three pages of his tax returns right before election day\nUm and we're just continue to push on his falling out says part of that we examined tens of thousands of public documents and we also got access to thousands and thousands of confidential documents from Fred Trump's real estate empire\nYou tend to questions to Donald Trump his lawyer Charles Harder responded that should the times stage or implied that President Trump participated in fraud or tax evasion or any other crime it will expose you to buy ability and damages for defamation so I Know the language is careful here and is in the article how would you characterize\nThe charges you're putting out here concerning Donald Trump is family and the families empire\n... we found in terms of the the the wrong doing we found several instances based on the documents that we looked up where a Donald Trump participated in fraudulent talk ski\nIs getting into some examples of if you are now it just to for instance can we talk about what happened\nIt just to for instance can we talk about what happened when they do is huge numbers of loans that Donald Trump received from his father had grown to into the millions of dollars how did he covered for those\nDonald Trump that sort of long claimed as part of of this this\nNarrative that he's credited for himself that he's sort of been a pretty much up from nothing businessman who made it to the president he's like a self made billionaire and and we found not only did we we uncovered in the documents dot only at least sixty one million dollars in loans\nThat uh that Trump extended to Donald Trump and the case as many of them were be repaid we also found that Donald Trump received over ... lifetime more than ... and beyond also has an inheritance more than four hundred million dollars from his father\nSaid temping is his father and there's one instance you give that he said Trump at one point and spent about fifty million dollars to buy a stake in at ... palace how how did he then and then sold it back to his son can you describe that\nSure I think spent Fifteen million would be a generous description of it he Donald Trump owed um his father Fifteen million dollars and not that that um instead of being a you know written off\nWas in fact he used it to invest in the Trump power so he turned the debt into an investment in Trump powerless and then it was written down to almost nothing\nYou mentioned companies the old county building supply maintenance can you tell us what that was\nSure that was one of the most intriguing a fraud that we found it was probably the most kind of ones with the bright lights around it spread Trump who's getting older and to his eighties\nHe he'd only not only you know huge number of buildings in the New York area worth hundreds of millions of dollars but he was also sitting on a huge amount of cash and Donald Trump ... siblings realized that\nAt some point he was going to die and not money was going to be subject to a fifty five percent inheritance talks to what the Trump\nRealized that at some point he was going to die and not money was going to be subject to a fifty five percent inheritance talks to what the Trump ... kids that it's it's pretty incredible for years for Trump would\nYou know for his buildings he would buy everything from bridges and so and then one day a company called ... county was created suddenly all county started doing all the buying for fried Trump's empire they would pay three hundred dollars for new fridge is then they would create a separate receipt\nAnd they would mark it up anywhere from twenty to fifty percent and send it up to Fred and the difference on not\nWas pocketed by county which\nWas controlled by Donald Trump and his siblings it ... it allowed them to drain huge amounts millions of dollars in cash from their fathers empire so that would not be subject to the death tax\nJust finally the kind of an overarching a theme of this this investigation is that\nThat Donald Trump is presented is understood to have been a self made man isn't but why why does it matter what is that it my way does that fit into your a story about tried as to how Donald Trump benefited profited from that mythology\nWell he's he's benefitted greatly over the years from this this law that has been repeated over and over and over and\nI guess just the myth making him that's been wrong and it's a spectacular ... it was interesting as we were going through the reporting early on in the Nineteen seventies right out you know when he graduates and he goes to work for his father he doesn't interview you know with the New York times and he goes around and he he talks about this job that's his and\nAnd this building that says and he's driving around in a car and he's you know showing this reporter all this stuff and it was incredible every\nEvery building he showed the reporter was his father's even though he claimed it was his own as his life went on he then started to diminish his father's achievements you know he would say only about a million dollars\nWas his own as his life went on he then started to diminish his father's achievements you know he would say only about a million dollar loan my father was a great building but it was in Brooklyn and queens and then when it came time in two thousand and four or five years after fried Trump stuff\nTo sell the empire the biggest single payday in his life in two thousand and four was done very quietly and just finally what was that final payday that year was ... just under two hundred million dollars he got roughly like a hundred and Seventy seven million\nThe empire itself sold for roughly eight hundred million in and we found through other records that it should have been valued at roughly a billion so even on that day the man who wrote the art of the deal you know I think got less than a lot less than he probably should have for that sale\nExtraordinary Suzanne thank you very much for speaking with us okay great thank you\nBye Suzanne Craig is the New York times reporter responding to the times investigations states taxation authority in New York City would review the allegations and his quote vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation\nThere is more on this story on our website CBC dot CA slash a I H\nIn most parts of the country is early autumn but in parts of Alberta you would be forgiven for mistaking it for the next season\n[noise] yesterday instead of pleasant multi colored leaves snow fell in areas around Calgary a lot of snow as much as sixty centimeters of snow if you were inside sipping tea it was not well\nIf you were inside sipping tea it was not welcome but otherwise not a huge deal if you were on the roads it was a nightmare on one highway hundreds of motorists were stuck for hours stretching into the night\nTrumpet player ... Linda ... was one of them and after a while he decided to get out of his car and serenade his fellow stranded motorist we reached him Mr ... Linden in Calgary\nEnds when did you realize yes today that you are well and truly stuck on the road\n[laughter] well I look bad and I saw a bunch of are truckers with their flashers on it became a dead stop pretty much in the middle of nowhere and neither lane was moving left or right at a quick look around one of those semi rigs and I could see cars as far as you could possibly\n... and so what time of the day to do this did you get stuck to not move again what time is that\nWhile I was a leisurely drive back I a hit the the actual car roadblock at about ... am I and that's when we can't go full stop and it was bright outside and it wasn't too cold just below zero so I didn't feel like there was going to be too big of a problem\nAnd how long we are that\nWell I was out there for ten and a half hours and hadn't moved an inch nobody had there were literally hundreds but probably a thousand card easily by couldn't you just turn around and head back\nThere's a very wide Meridian in between it's sort of a grassy knoll which was completely and people we covered it snow or in fact at one point a number of hours and there was a brave SUV driver who literally launched his vehicle into the er into the ditch and he had enough power to fly to about two hundred meters we finally got on the other side\nAnd it's an area that has a ... all one particular which as water ... two thousand meters which\nIs a very fashionable depth the water we don't know really uh how much fishes there and we suspect that there is not a lot\nAbout their own doing really is home and it's probably our big cod and our economy is the underpinning all the pretty much the entire Arctic ecosystem CEOs whales overbearing directly you know dependent on a ... for their food source\nAnd it's a very oily fish it would lend itself very well to what's referred to as a reduction fishery\nOr where you catch this issue a turn of the century into into a meal paddle fish milk product and you know there's a demand for that uh the central Arctic ocean is only a third and talked to buy into it was only eight thousand miles from courts in Southeast Asia so it's you know it is\nAt a central Arctic ocean has only eight to ... to buy into it was only eight thousand miles from courts in East Asia so you know it is accessible and I said I and many of these cases insurance can be prosecuted economically but they can't be prosecuted sustained way\nAnd I think that's the hard central at the ocean as it stands right now\nOkay understand you correctly in these countries who had designed the Arctic five is they call them kind of Norway Russia Denmark or the United states the fishing nations Iceland Japan South Korea China European Union they've all signed onto this\nFor sixteen years is march I Am but they're looking at some pretty rich fish stocks in there that they want to get their hands on so I ... ... you're saying that you can imagine that will be anytime when you could sustainably fish there so what happens is the end is sixteen years and they say okay you've had your way and now we're getting in there\nWell I don't know that it can never have a I don't think it can happen right now and I don't think it could happen in foreseeable future\nNevertheless there is a a mechanism for renewal for in five year increments it will not be renewed only if somebody puts up their hands so to speak of says we want to end this agreement yeah I think that before we go too far into the future speculate on what might happen\nI I think the important thing here today is too is that you know reflect on the fact that this actually happened right now which is just so impressed I still can't really believe that because you're not so much that people would go there today because there is a as a commercially viable stock people have a tendency sometimes state so pushing companies\nTo go places to stay in ground you know what I'm saying that I was there so\nWhen the time comes I have to be at the table to have my piece of the pie a and that's been prevented here now\nAll right well it could be interesting to watch what happens in the central Arctic ocean I thank you\nTo watch what happens in the central Arctic ocean that thank you very much for telling us about Mr Taylor\nThank you very much for your interest by\nTrump retailers the VP of conservation with oceans
