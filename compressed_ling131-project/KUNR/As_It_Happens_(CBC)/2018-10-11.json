warnings weren't what are you hearing\nWell it was a thunder storm last friday and south of the Yucatan and then Saturday morning it was a tropical storm\nAnd I was not that concern at that point but I have a number of boat captains that became very concerned and they said this is one that we need to watch\nAnd by Sunday Morning it was almost panic ville with everybody I was talking to\nI started to pack up things to take just in case the house wouldn't be there knowing in my mind that it was probably going to be a cat three and I would come back to our house some shingles might be off but I'd come back to our house\nThat why would it matters to them presuming that this is what happened why would it matters didn't so much to get rid of this\nWhy indeed T for years was a kind of a mouthpiece for the Saudis house but he was someone that a lot of western diplomats and journalists would turn to\nTo get a kind of cogent rendition of the royal family's perspective and as a critic styles

are washing posed a contributor\nUh we're urged them to them it maybe they wanted to teach a lesson but it's it's really a puzzle in part because it's foreseeable that a lot of western journalists and

with both sides have been careful to maintain cordial relations\nThere both important regional players and I think they both feel a need to continue to get along and really is quite inconvenient for the Turks have for president I Would want\nTo have that rupture now because Saudi is a it's a pretty big trading partner and the economy's in trouble already so there's not much incentive for him to be picking a fight\nWe know in Canada what it is to take on ... Mohammed bin Salman and or has had quite a dust up with him it was in fact Mr ... he wrote about that\nBut why isn't the rest of the world responded dismissing us peasant Donald Trump saying he's

saying they knew nothing about this and we don't know what happened to him he's not going to show up alive\nIt never say never but every day gets less and less likely and it's really hard for me to believe that the Saudis are keeping 'em someplace locked up and make a lot of sense that he's kind of a runaway a himself he hiding some place I Would that work out so I'm not optimistic about a
