that just a last month and you're adding to our fiftieth anniversary of being on the air we ask people to send us where they listen to the show and uh\nOf being on the air we asked people to send us

think he should count on that at all rental but you can't do much\nAbout [laughter] yo yo sheep on his arm and all that all changed our name on I'm On a bomb on them like\nSo we wanted to control that\nPart of the study as much as possible\nAnd I know the CIA funded study and they did some polling where they found that one in five young Canadians believe that they are as good or even better when they drive when they're under the influence of what do you make of that [noise]\nIt's interesting because in in our study what we did ask them at different times ... also how they felt about their driving safety and the majority of our participant I'm didn't feel that they would be safe drivers and even after five hours\nThe they have some self awareness ability and that's interesting when we're thinking about maybe going through with uh some self awareness campaigns\nSo you didn't have those one in five young to know the other you know but also they were they're aware that there is a test and says are probably being more reflective ... on their minds date\nYeah it might be the case you're right uh that they may be more reflective because they're in a study about driving and and and the use of Kennedy's so again I'm thinking forward in terms of public awareness campaigns and if we can\nAgain I'm thinking forward in terms of public awareness campaigns and if we can if they can be targeted to sensitized uh the public and the young drivers I think that's an interesting way one interesting way to go\nGiven your research given what you found out what what would what would you advise and the way of trying to teach young people about marijuana and driving\nI think that that bought the ... messages that if you are under the influence of Kennedy's if you smoke or inhale you shouldn't be driving and you should wait a long enough period of time before a dry resuming you're driving in our case even after five hours\nA their capacity was still impaired so uh you need to uh wait to significant amount of time before taking the wheel again\nYou were looking at Eighteen to twenty four year old and you know you were interested in knowing how senior citizens who might be interested in marijuana for medicinal reasons as well as recreational I mean that are you looking to do some more studies like this\nI there are many needed but there are other groups that we didn't look at in our study so as you were mentioning a older I'm drivers or using a candidates for him it is no reason\nA daily users of Kennedy's um these are all different groups and I don't know that we can extrapolate our results to these other groups where the impact or the influence of Kennedy's may have different defect\nAlright well very very interesting information during this historical week so we are in the midst of the rest of the other no thank you it's a it was a pleasure thank you\n[noise] that was professor Isabel ... from the school of physical and occupational therapy at McGill University we reached her in Montreal\nJust her in Montreal\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDominic lived long is struggling to sell something that once seemed like a no brainer Mr that long is Justin Trudeau is minister of inter governmental affairs he took on the job this summer as what was once widespread support for liberals carbon pricing plan\nBegan to implode the Trudeau government has put the plan at the center of its commitment to combat climate change but Ontario Manitoba scotch one and the odds are all now oppose we reached inter governmental affairs minister Dominic ... in Ottawa\nTo buy you had a broad provincial support for your carbon pricing plan was ambitious and they're on side now you have\nCarbon pricing plan was ambitious than they are on side now you happiness would be premier is lining up to fight to even to take you to court what went wrong\nSo Carol from our perspective um we haven't been consistent with Canadians uh and with our international on global partners to Canada must take urgent action to face the real challenges of climate change we campaigned on that and plenty Fifteen\nAs you noted are referred to in twenty sixteen the provinces a ball signed a framework agreement which spoke about a number of measures\nAnd some provincial elections have created circumstances where different governments are now saying that they want to take a different approach we've also said publicly that our provincial election doesn't actually constitute or climate change plan\nAnd we have told Canadians and we've told ... the international community that Canada was going to take robust and serious action so we're continuing towards the commitment we made around for example putting a price on pollution making polluters pay\nIt back to what you just said because you said that they're they're taking a different tack\nYou have ... years as a painting of Ontario or they want to be premier of Alberta who quite possibly will be the premier who are not just opposing you taking a different tack\nThey are campaigning by fighting the carbon tax they are putting out rallies come and fight the carbon tax they're raising funds\nFor their campaigns on the backs of saying we're going to tear up this carbon tax idea so it's not just a little bit of push back you have a full scale wind coming toward you\nSo again if some conservative leaders are conservative ... want to run campaigns on particular issues they can explain to them\nSome conservative leaders are conservative ... want to run campaigns on particular issues they can explain to their citizens and be accountable for those campaign decisions I don't\nOr purport to understand or or speak for the campaign strategy of different conservative leaders across the country\nBut if conservative leaders and in this case Andrew sheer federally\nDoes not have any semblance or any coherent plans to meet the challenges of climate change\nWe're telling Canadians we do and and provincial premier is getting organized\nRallies if they want and say what they wanted those partisan rallies what we're focused on a is bringing forward a very clear and robust plan to tackle the serious challenge of climate change which Canadians see in their daily lives is very real\nWe saw Carolyn New Brunswick with a historic floods last spring the wildfires in British Columbia the tornados that hit auto and got you know a few weeks ago so Canadians notice Israel and they expect their government to take coherent and concerted action\nThan we have said that we will we are prepared to do that in the case of provinces decide not to be partners we\nHave a federal plan including a price on pollution which will come into effect on January first and we will then be in a position to give that money back to Canadians in those jurisdictions where we apply the federal plan because provincial leaders have decided not to take their obligations seriously\nI guess I'm asking you is that if some of these ... are\nActually campaigning on fighting the carbon tax or calling it the job killing taxes you know and they're being successful doing that isn't entirely their fault that people are buying into it that or is it the fact that possibly you're a liberal government the federal government has failed to make it clear to Canadians why you think it's necessary\nSo again that the job killing taxes that was a phrase Mr Harper used to use all the time in the house of commons\nSo again the job killing taxes that was a phrase Mr Harper used to use all the time in the house of commons I remember that when we were sitting in the corner in third place he used to accuse the liberals have having all these job killing tax secret plans\nAnd Canadians took us from from third place to first place with a majority government and implementing a price on pollution and coming up with a robust serious plan that deals with the real challenge of climate change is a commitment we made the Canadians and it's something that our government\nIs very serious about uh about putting in place and as I say I think we need to be careful if there were Thirteen premier of provinces and territories across the country just because one or two or three ... find a megaphone and go to a rally we shouldn't\nCross infect other jurisdictions that are working constructively and positively with us on a on these issues\nBut it's not just as you premier is is that you got for clean is against you you've got Ontario got one prince Edward island plus now Manitoba I buy in Palestine just a month ago destined to do was celebrating him as the conservatives who gets it\nAnd then you've got Alberto ... he could take other next that's not just a few years more than half the Canadian population\nBut again I ... and Kenny has to be careful not to assume the job of premier until he wins it in elections\nMr palace there\nAgain that would be a good question for Mr ... because if he decides to change his plan or withdraw plan that he had shared with us that included putting a price on pollution", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Reno", "day": "16"}
