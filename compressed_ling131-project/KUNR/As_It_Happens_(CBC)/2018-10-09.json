even bother to uh uh trying to answer [noise] but I couldn't get back to sleep I started thinking well it's unusual that gets bam at the time a morning so I thought maybe it was when my kids and then I\nThinking well it's unusual to get spam at that time a morning so I thought maybe it was when my kids and then I looked and saw that it was from Sweden and I thought oh I better I better give them a call back\nAnd how exciting it to get that news\nBut the moment that was really I really started to feel excited was I'd I'd check they told me you know and ... and I said but is it isn't shared with anybody and they said yes it's with Bill nor the house and then I was actually starting to to get happy because I think bill is a terrific choice and I've\nArgued for a long time that he you know he deserves the price so that that made it very special\nAnd the reason why the two of you do you do different kinds of economics at that you are it's combined together for your understanding of how economies can grow sustainably back from a different point of view right so\nI always hate to ask this question but in a nutshell can you describe your work\nA abducted will being held in the concept so uh from that point you get the purpose of this was to you know to to to make that case that he wasn't there so we did have a have a tour of the building as you say it's it's it's a pretty large building from the outside it looks like a regular that townhouse if you'd like it's a maybe\nA two or three stories but it goes there are two three floors subterranean tours as well so we had a tour of the consulate from the the absolute basement whether it was a prayer room where the sort of filing storage rooms\nI'm On the other five floors that include um a visa counters that include uh offices for officials with dealing with Saudi a fast you know Saudi nationals who are in ...\nUh the counsel's office himself um and and other offices so we did have an extensive to um to constantly going round she was in ... to sort of show look you know nothing to hide here\nUm but obviously we are a I'm a journalist I wasn't conducting a forensic such um I couldn't in at the end of that to say\nYou know there's there's nothing to be seen hit but but it was a very unusual move they said they've never done this before I'm a history of the ... from that perspective it was in ... I'm trying to go a long way I'm to discount any accusations that she ... she was actually being held out to come to the\nMotor bizarre scene that must have been doing going around like helping cupboards no nothing that he's not here is not under the table he's at the back room I mean that's that is really strange [laughter]\nIt's one of the more unusual assignments I've done ...\nIt's one of the more unusual assignments I've done setting the\nThe thing about Mr ... them saying that he is now here we don't have any hair he's not in Saudi Arabia it that doesn't exactly say that they didn't do something to him does it\nKnow that was that was simply somebody to say he wasn't a he wasn't ... on Saturday afternoon when when we visited and that there were no obvious immediate signs of of anything untoward that\nThere are a lot of political tensions between Saudi Arabia and turkey so it does that factor into your your your the questioning of the Turkish authorities and what they say happened to Mr ...\nIt's definitely onto the picture um as you say that the relations and not not great for a number of reasons a president I Would want the government itself is um his party has its roots in Islamic Islamic politics took he supported a government in Egypt that was a Muslim Brotherhood\nGovernment in twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen or the Muslim Brotherhood is that the movement which the Saudis have declared as a as a terrorist organization\nSo um they're all big political differences between turkey and Saudi Arabia president Edwin has has not\nYou know go on a one hundred percent on sort of attack mode criticism mode of Saudi Arabia\nThat may also reflect the fact that Saudi Arabia is an important a very important country in the region it's an economic power\nUm it's an important country for a for Muslims it's home to Islam to how the science\nSo it will be I'm a very major escalation if if he came out officially publicly an openly and I made a very direct accusation against the king of Saudi Arabia um that it had to liberty killed a citizen in in stumble [noise]\nLiberty killed a citizen in ... [noise] ... Dominique I appreciate speaking with you tonight thank you thanks very much\nDumb and Kevin is Reuters bureau chief in Turkey we reached him in his temple\nMm Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm Mm ... who\nThere are some things that humans spent almost no time and effort on like the signaling on the highway or fixing climate change but there is at least one thing to do which we are extremely sincerely dedicated to\nMaking alcohol out of every single thing that we can make it from the most recent example distillers have found a way to make vodka straight from cow's milk the product is called vodka out and it is the work of dairy distillery\nMe McDonald is the founder of dairy distillery we reached him in ... Ontario\nMay lead says vodka made from the cows now it tastes like\nA it tastes well my opinion is fantastic it's imagine a stat or not\nBut with absolutely no burned and the sweet smell and the a carnival he finish leaving no burn a you're off to college date a golf and often has said after the tone sort of\nTaste to it which many people don't like a ... when you drink it burns going down but ours has none of that it's a very smooth expect\n... nail polish remover egg egg\n[laughter] quite sibling delicately so what is it looked like who looked like milk\nOh no it's completely clear just like a like a bug could lead to Philip to Ninety four percent alcohol purity and then diluted spring water to bring it to for the ... so you could mix it with all your favorite cocktails by what people are telling us is that it's good to sit on its own which is pretty rare and about\nIt and made this with the regular milk or or what part of milk is using can make the vodka\nSo we're using um called new permanent so what happens is the milk comes into the little protests are from all the dairy farms in our case we're working with ...\nThat the largest protests are about an hour south part of what the facts are taken off to me fighter and ice cream and then there was a skim milk\nAnd what they do to make it cheaper to ship the proteins skim milk they concentrate them by taking out the water and when they do that they also take out the life toes or minerals and vitamins and that liquid is called no problem yet\nAnd what's interesting is right now they have very little use for it and the vast majority of it is dumped and that's why we're turning into all\nThis ... this is their the farmers just get rid of it is to think this is a waste product as a doctor now can tease and and thunder production\nStuff right I I don't like to call it uh we spent the something that's being wasted right now but uh but milk sugar recalled the sugars is it in that and that's right now the farmers out you have to pay for those safe disposable of this because like closes harmful to the environment so it's an environmental problem\nIt's a financial problem because it costs to dispose of it\nAnd also no one wants to see a good portion of what comes out of the cat wasted\nHow do you turn it into alcohol\nThat's where uh we work with the University of Ottawa with a professor there in the biology department to hide I ... that can prevent a ... most of these won't eat it but you know new Steve how are you will consume a lot to do some ...\nEat it but you know Steve how are you will consume a lot to do some gardening softball\nSomeone's distilled in big vats like a like any other alcohol\nThat's all right well it comes in we actually gonna milk truck that pulls up here are they pump it into our from intern so we have a large spill preventers\nWe filled up with 'em let 'em we pitch in argues they get to work they take about three or four days to divert the lot those into alcohol then we put into our struggles when we purify the alcohol right up to Ninety four percent\nAnd then uh we dog eat that with water to make about ...\nIf someone were lactose intolerant can they drink this\nOh that's a great question no not at all so the Big East will cleave the lock those flew into their basic triggers an equal sugars absolutely no lactose in the final product\nAnd is it something you have to refrigerate\nI don't know at a at the end of it it sounds like an hour or just the only difference it's are being made from a from low\nSo and not respect since ... variations like it's like ... guys that ... the nail polish remover and and do you drink it straight you mix it with something that's what's what what do you what are your recipes at this point\nWhere you can make food and uh we found that it mixes are obviously very well with milk from the ... are also make concrete which are so think of a bally's part of one hundred percent but there were a working hard and and but also for the sit ins Frank feedback is\nPeople like to just uh on ice so ah it's very versatile\nThey make a wet Russian I presume a very white Russia [laughter]\nOf course you're talking about the area because as a new trade agreement with the United states and what that means to dairy farmers they're quite upset about that is ...\nDairy farmers they're quite upset about that is ... is something that dairy farmers ... how do you think that that affects the dairy industry\nAll like for example right now on the street is the largest purchaser of Ontario green\nAt right now the alcohol in the outskirts of nothing from there so uh if we can make this a popular we could become a a significant source of burden or for dairy farmers which as you mentioned are huge pressure right now so if you want to support the dirt farmer ...\n[laughter] and and will you be exporting to the United states\nOf right now uh we've built to distort our sort of aren't produced probably for the alternative to that is we get larger we'd love to sit this Robert ...\nAnd what's to stop somebody else is taking your recipe taking this this system this method of making their own\nYou call yourself he said I'm I'm In uh nothing left to lose club I think you said in I interview\nRight right well there were a lot of us are back in the day I mean I was um when there were a lot of people who have lost children in the war and uh that's what we call ourselves\nBut you came to this point is it a forgiving housing collie at not immediately this is something that was it princess it took some months about half a year and you're describing that to us when we spoke to in two thousand and six I just wanted to play a bit of what you said at that time\nI have to admit that it took a little bit of time I never once asked for revenge against because I knew that that was going to fight song shade without a fight it took me a while about a half a point where I can honestly say that I for\nOne day I catalogue vacated now of course there by immaculate university oh that was titled for sure\nOf course you're by immaculate university that vision for the way\nI thought you know a lot of Catholic I'm not a Christian [noise] even very much of anything but I have to take the course of course and I learned what was his mouth\n[noise] at least two thousand six Michael what did that going to teach you that forgiveness\nWell I think one of the biggest things that they taught me was that to forgive someone is not to condone what they did I certainly don't condone what what Cirque our dead\nBut it's basically I ... I Would say you know not to hate admitted is process um the sister sister ... who taught that corset ... said\nUm forgiveness is like quitting cigarettes sometimes you have to do it over and over again so it's you know it's a ... it it is a process and ah\nShe was just so great in presenting things in such a way that anybody\nCould could accept them and explaining the nuances of the differences between condoning and forgiving and and other things that people often confused and ultimately\nForgiveness isn't for the person being forgiven as for the person who's doing the forgiving and it changed my outlook on life in general on my relations with people especially people close to me and uh\nThe people close to me and a inherits it's still a tremendous factor in my life\nIt fair to say that that could change the course of your life\nIt's certainly the it's very fair to say\nAnd Peter I I think it's safe to say that a ... interview Michael's words changed your life didn't [noise]\nUh yeah they did I I just got a muscle just listening to do it again and um I I mean it's funny just listening to it in today's times uh twelve years later and and realizing that that message is still more important than ever I'm at the time I was listening to Michael and as I was listening to this interview I [noise]\nI just wasn't expecting the way that it was going to unfold and the reaction that he was describing and as you know what I found out later in the interview that people call them a coward and had shot at him I just said\nI said hang on a second [laughter] you know the the the message that this man is saying is that the most courageous brave choice I've ever heard somebody ever make and it felt like\nThe antidote to this escalating hatred that was was happening in the world and just listening to it again today I'm just like it's still the answer [laughter] it still remains the answer it still remains more important than ever so\n'til you struck but do you remember the details the situation in which you listen to to Michael in this interview\nYeah I was I was driving along in my car and and a Canadian musician spend a lot of time driving across Canada a lotta time listening CBC and and I would always listen to as it happens and\nThe and and I would always listen to as it happens and\nAnd you know it's just sort of those things it's on and you're listening to it and you're taking it in but it's one of those interviews that I just kinda zeroed in on as I clued into what was being said and and to me the part that\nI was very moved you know just by Michael's reaction in itself I was very unexpected reaction but what really kind of jolted me into action was was the fact that\nYou know like I said that people shot at him and and and called them a coward and just put him through\nEven more held and then I ... I don't have a son I don't know what it's like to lose one let alone under the circumstances that Michael last Nick I'm so when I found out that that people were doing that to him I just said that to me is just\nJust unconscionable I Need to do something about that and and I need to somehow amplify his message and and yet the you know the context of it was you know ... or ... was this target and they were like hey we got 'em and gay victory um mission accomplished that kind of lingo and you know they were using\nA I mean I I I don't want to speak for Mike on this but they were using Nick in the murder of ... or ... as as a reason to justify what they were doing revenge yeah\n... and the lyrics of your son I'm just going to read the the course and they were going to hear it later on some people know they're not going to miss that so I guess I'm going to have to try forgiveness because men you know that's all that I've got left my boy did not deserve this but neither do the rest\nI guess in going to have to try forgiveness how did those words come to you\nHow did those words continue\nThose words came to me right away [laughter] um I think I pulled over and wrote down those words and then as is often the case for me with with writing I I kind of have the initial thing and then I knew I needed to be with that because sometimes the the sort of surface reaction is is not deep enough and I I immediately just\nCared about it so deeply and I and I knew that I was going to be singing in Michael's voice so I wanted to\nDo it properly um it wasn't just about channeling my own feelings about it I really wanted to amplify his voice that was the goal\nSo I wrote those words down and then I actually ended up seeking out to a copy of the interview that you guys had done and I I transcribed it\nI'm just so I could kind of practice putting words together in the way that Michael put words together and really than just kind of work from there and very carefully put it together\n... Michael ... when you first heard this on what was your reaction\nUh are as a reserve or calm ... turtle we overcome that um\nIn light of all the negative reactions though I had that someone would have such an understanding of what our men and these are kind and serve\nA generous in a in this respect or just overcame may still does Everytime I hear it\n[noise] the two of you because\n... the two of you became friends didn't you\nRefer to his door yeah [noise]\nWhat was the friendship based on was it just this moment you didn't do did you find it to the to deep replaced a Luke who\nWas a Knicks Knicks best friend organized to a concert and they created a scholarship in Nick's name they called it ... [laughter] and they are invited me down to come perform at that concert and so I went down to west Chester Pennsylvania\nAnd I I stayed in a guest room it leaks house where he told me that Nick would have spent much time and um [noise]\nAnd then we did this concert and I got to meet Michael we went for a coffee together in the afternoon and then I I played this concert and uh I stood on stage and in my view or nix friends and family and teachers and Michael and um [noise]\nAnd I got to play the song and um I my whole body shaking just thinking about that moment in and how touched I felt to be able to do that in and contribute in that way and then several years in a row I went down in and did that and\nAnd then Michael and I were also invited to give a symposium on forgiveness at a at a college in Philadelphia in two thousand twelve and we've got to spend even more time together then and I remember going for a long walk together in a park and just just so enjoying our time together\nI think it's I I Believe a generation difference isn't that mean you would be closer to Nick Cage\nDoes that mean you would be closer to nix age ah yeah yeah I'm In my mid thirties so um I I guess about things and that could have been is that right Michael record the forty okay so pretty close to five years younger yeah\nSticking the singer songwriter Peter cats who wrote a song called forgiveness and inspired by an interview on as it happens with Michael Byrd\nOr a man who's on the line from Norfolk, Virginia as someone who forgave his son's killer in Iraq and uh I I I think we need to hear the song I think at this point these so I'm going to ask you to play it for us yeah absolutely\n\nYes me to explain it does everything and nothing to say um\nSome things that happen and once they do then never go away\nThey tell you that this life is a man you know I think that's so that's why I Will not stoke the fire this thing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Reno", "day": "09"}
