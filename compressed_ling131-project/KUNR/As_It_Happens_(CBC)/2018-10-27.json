happening anywhere but\nYou know obviously being a representative of this community\nAnd being a person who is of this community raising my children in the community um\nIt's gut wrenching it's gut wrenching I\nI I just can't imagine that anyone would do this and\nWe did receive it to the official package in our office and my staff\nWho is trained to\nBe able to recognize a wet when we get a suspicious package it exactly the right thing followed the procedures and guy and you know obviously when\nYou you have a suspicion package from the rocket then you have back who has who has handled

screening and protection\nFor the people that are helping us do our job that\nAnd certainly have to ask you this but I'm ... can you tell me what you learned about what happened to your brother Nick at night in March and how he was killed\nSo the Hoover driver had only been in Toronto I Believe for four days or so so he didn't really know anything really was so he he gets on the highway but he's going eastbound instead of West bound you\nCan even really know attraction to you on so he gets off it's been a huge turned around to start going west on the Gardner and uh they're coming up with a turn off to the airport and his uh phone a lot of its cradle onto the floor\nAnd he pulled over set aside the highway\nBut he didn't fully pull over he was still partially in the last play the traffic and he Richard this phone and then when you re entered the highway without really properly speeding up or checking as mayor at the same time there was a BMW\nDealt with is changing lanes from the central him to the right lane and that driver admitted that he was a\nHe said he was taking the time on his phone I mean who knows if that's true or not but he was looking at his phone\nWhile changing lanes and the damned dog Schreiber rear ended the river and it was exactly the point where my little brother was sitting in the class so my little brother side of the car took out all of the impact and uh ... not cause was broken and he was basically\nKilled instantly thankfully his uh\nIt was basically killed into my thankfully his uh his girlfriend Monica I'm was only moderately injured\nSo sorry what what training to do you drive or had\nA nothing in twenty sixteen when city council was meeting to decide on what regulations there should be for a ride truck drivers what they ended up doing was just getting rid of safety training for\nNot just assure drivers a taxi drivers as well they lower the bar for everyone it was just incredibly reckless in stupid decision as a direct reluctant to death I think because this tribe or I don't think could have passed a the most basic safety safety test\nHe was just so incompetent and ah he had no business transferring the public at all so um we're looking for is just some bare minimum of safety training some safety attracts you to see that someone actually has a competent and safe driver before they're allowed to pick up members of the public because when you call it Hoover you don't\nIt's it's a complete stranger who's coming to pick you up you don't know how safe are are confident they are\nOr earlier this month Hoover candidate said that they think the technology they already have a good job of sensing a driver skill on the road and then its customers lodge safety concerns about driving the company will investigate what do you think about those measures\nThat completely ridiculous I mean it's the passengers are doing the safety testing for river if it drivers on faith and confidence and I guess he or she will pay a passengers for awhile give them an said fries and and the passengers will alert Hoover are raised a tribe or poorly I mean I'm sure this a driver would have actually been weeded out that way but in the meantime the public\nWould have actually been weeded out that way but in the meantime the public's being put at risk\nEven experience drivers sometimes do really stupid things how can you be that the extra safety training would have prevented the kind of accident that your brother was killed and\nI mean yeah accidents absolutely happen all the time in this case if you could have been some freak accident if you had done everything that would be understandable but the level of incompetence and the recklessness there's just extreme and we can't we kept preventive react to that from happening\nWe can take simple commonsense measures to reduce the likelihood of things like a ... and\nYou and your family even launched a petition to convince the city of Toronto that new bridge drivers require safety training um how hopeful are you that that will happen\nCautiously optimistic that common sense will prevail the whole um idea to completely got rid of safety training for\nAll the drivers and ... it was so shortsighted and naive I think it was just a bunch of a middle aged guys who wanted to see 'em like they were with the times and I do as someone who works in talk myself I Do just\nBecause it's new and flashy doesn't mean we don't need fifty training those rules were there for a very good reason\nPatrick just isn't it terrible year for you and your family with with the loss of your brother Nick how are you how are you all doing now\n[noise] um it's been yeah it's been horrible because uh the baby of the family he was a eight years younger than my sister and I and uh he was really one of all of us who really likes loves loves those\nOne of all of us really like love life most and lived up to the fullest had he was also just sort of conscious as we were all together is the last weekend before the accident and I actually took a metal he was very hard drive and\nI took him out in the car that you could talk to who he was so different cautious he was he was driving so slowly he was ... years and years after like Alex like to relax\nAnd uh for someone so conscientious and so a caring about there's three killed in this way just makes it all the more frustrating and five\nPatch again and again I'm Sorry I'm and thank you so much for speaking with the oh no problem with our father\nPatrick Cameron is Nick cameras older brother Nick was killed last march while traveling in a new ... the driver of that Hoover was handed a careless driving traffic sign yesterday in connection with the next ...\nNext parents Cheryl hawks in the late bill Kamron or

Philadelphia's city council has made up its mind ... last night it passed a resolution to welcome and owner these soft uncontroversial new mask off of the Philadelphia fliers here's a clip\nOf

Philadelphia fliers and\nBy the end of the resolution [noise]\nFifty year old girl born on the fire season ticket holders through second that alright\nMoving probably sick at all in favor say aye those oppose us having that ... [noise] uh\n...\nOr [noise]\nThe ugly [noise]\nGreedy is the Philadelphia players first ever mascot he is not a traditional mascot he's fine but he's also horrifying and because of that he has divided fans and the people around the world\nThey were human created and designed gritty he lives in West grove Pennsylvania but today we reached Mr Raymond in the villages Florida [noise]\nRaymond what was it like to hear a city council page\nMr Raymond what was it like to hear a city council pay tribute to gritty\nWell I'll tell you it's um this whole thing has been somewhat of a surprise when it reached a a different level of deaths of all if you will in terms of the acknowledgement and the acceptance because going in certainly\nUh we were preparing for it to not be accepted in any way shape or form in in terms of British Rule out and did not only that it did come in negative very early in the short twenty four hours at a completely reversed and now suddenly\nA gritty is a phenomenon and it's it's not something that anybody myself for the flyers explains expected\nWhy were you expecting such a negative reaction well have you ever been to Philadelphia [laughter]\nHuge bill I'm not sure who you're insulting [laughter] why on I'm going to take a I'm going to take a pedal bike [laughter]\nAre fans are are very very discriminating in terms they had great knowledge about each sport um and they don't like any fooling around you know they want to get to it they want to win so they when you throw some marketing at them they sense that this is some you know the way to get people to love the flyers\nUm they're against it in in Philadelphia it's been tough fans they do not like you know the furry creatures however the fanatic [noise]\nA kind of slipped under the radar back in Nineteen Seventy eight has become one of the best known mascots in sports\nThis is the Philly fanatic um for the for the Phillies baseball team\nCorrect and and he's probably recognize as one of the best mascots and all sports [noise] um and and I was the performer for this an addict\n[noise] um and and I was the performer for this unethical and he was Nineteen Seventy eight so they were frightened too but I can that day you could come out and that they just let the attic come out one night than say anything about him and he got a lot of positive response but today's world\nMake an announcement that this is going to get the flyers mascot an organization who never really liked mascots and we're clear that they weren't going to have a mascot\nIt they knew ways and we're going to say that the negativity was going to come first um and I think the reason why it worked was they they embraced that they knew it was coming and then when it came they embrace it and had fun with it and and that flip the switch\nNow you you you mentioned you know being outside and of course you're protests have taken outside of the Vatican and the Senate what kind of reaction did you get there there are just ten percent of the ...\nWhat kind of reaction did you get there\nThere are just ten percent of the participants are women within the Senate hall so on the day that the Senate began we had a witness outside the Senate gates and to call for women to vote within within the Senate hall basic they called the bishop that name and say we see what you're doing a near closing the door and making decisions without us\nSo we were able to peacefully protest outside the Senate hall I'm also praying of or twenty five minutes before the Roman police came and I'm asked us to stop basically I was held for simply by my arm and everyone was forced show identification\n... what about the reaction from the crowds were there any was there any reaction from pass or ... or ... people observing\nNotably two pilots from Ireland came and greeted us and and took our materials the fact that women cannot vote in a meeting in two thousand Eighteen is it's pretty absurd to most people so we got a lot of support from people walking by\nNow Pope Francis has promised to put more women and leadership roles and after five years there are only six women in you know what can be defined as leadership roles at the Vatican what more would you like from him\nWell there are things that he could do immediately and he could appoint women took the position of leadership I'm across the Vatican today that conditions that don't require ordination\nNow there's been a lot of criticism of Pope Francis a boat how slow he has been to understand the sex abuse issue within the Catholic Church and how he said the right things but has has has been very slow to act\nI'm there hasn't been as much public criticism towards him about women do you think he gets the issue\nWomen do you think he gets the issue of of why women should be included in in the Catholic Church and given leadership positions\nMany of us are calling for quality and are not satisfied by the slow progress at his papacy to bring women into\nYou know substantial leadership position mhm but do you think you get to you know I\nI really hope that he is able to meet with men who are called to be precise as the pastor I Know that he you know would respond to them with a a generous heart and they hope that he has a man of conversion\nYeah no I understand that that's what you hope I guess what I'm trying to ask you is do you think that Pope Francis is a Catholic leader who can grasp uh why it's necessary in two thousand and Eighteen to fully include women\nUm I guess we'll have to see so far he hasn't made any moves to include women in substantial voting positions or made tremendous steps towards women in the position so I mean five years in a lot of us are\nYou know tired of waiting um but I I I Do think that it ... it takes time for change to happen but you know why I Do think that uh he has a lot to learn can microwave thanks so much for speaking with me thank you\n... is the executive director of the
