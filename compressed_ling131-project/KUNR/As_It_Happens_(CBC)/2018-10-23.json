Germany\nMr Nouri poorer we just heard Saudi foreign minister reiterating the country's latest story about what happened to ... catch all get gee what do you make of that explanation\nSo well a vote Ninety two percent of our housing stock is a privately owned that is a very very high a percentage and so we're going to have to move to more housing that is owned and operated by the nonprofit sector\nThat housing will probably look more or less the same but the way we run it will be very different it won't be based on on a you know making profits\nWe'll be very different it won't be based on on a you know making profit that means we can offer lower rent and then those buildings still make revenue so then we can use that extra revenue to put it into social housing which would be kind of welfare rate housing\nWhich will be also desperately need because the number of homeless center city has doubled since two thousand five\nOkay now you've also said you'll triple the empty home tax why do you think that will be effective\nWell the previous council did bring in a one percent tax on empty homes and we know it's starting to fill units that were just purely being speculated upon really empty condos essentially are they are starting to fill up now is as the owners try to ah\nYou know avoid the tax but we want to accelerate this as well and actually we're finding now that some speculators are selling their condos to folks that want to live in them so the the taxes are proving effective and tripling it will uh just amplifies that affect them this\nOkay now into the race was really very tight\nUh your main rival can Sam has not even conceited and assuming he doesn't require a a recount you'll be presiding over not just a divided council but a divided city I mean how how are you going to push forward with these housing policies without consensus on council or or in the city more broadly\nWell or as an MP for seven years I actually managed to kind of the unsinkable as I got to measure pass through the house of commons even though it was opposed by the sitting majority harbor government which was to bring electronic petitioning to Canada\nSo I have experience working across the aisle others this kind of joke that I was the most popular and pee and all parties but my own\nThere's this kind of joke that I was the most popular and pee and all parties but my own [laughter] because I Would work so often across the aisle so I'm very familiar with how to do that uh\nYou know I was ah I I wrote a book with Michael Chong last year a who's a conservative MP and that was awful arrested a\nWith a lizard with me trying to stop the Kendra Morgan pipeline so I have worked across party lines often as an MP and I know I can do that in the city council have already had some great conversations with counselors and not really paying attention to what party they were elected with\nAn estimated two hundred and sixty five people have died from overdoses in Vancouver already this year your predecessor Gregor Robertson called for the decriminalization of some drugs enforced safe to supply that is making available clean drugs that aren't paying ten what will you do to address the opioid epidemic\nWell I Know Gregor was on the right path the problem is he didn't have a provincial or federal government at least under the Harper regime that was all responsive to specific requests from the city\nSo I think I've said that I Would strike and emergency task force with a health care professionals in the first line responders to give us immediate steps that we can take\nAnd then it's my job to help go and get that implemented so that would be to for example talk to the federal government about getting specific exemptions from the criminal code to talk to the provincial government boat some specific health care funding and to really focus on what I've been advised is the best step forward is this a substitution programs\nAnd new ways of uh distributing these substitute drugs\nJust one last question a voter turnout was thirty nine percent that was down\nTurnout was thirty nine percent that was down from last election what are you going to do to make people feel like it's actually worth showing up to vote\nWell we have the worst electoral system in the world here it's called an at large system it was an important from the United states are no other city major city in Canada uses it a and in fact it's been struck down as discriminatory based on race in in dozens and dozens of US cities\nSo I've said that this will be the last time we uh we used this type of system you can't believe the ballot it's literally falls off the edge of the table that so long because everybody's included on it we don't have award system like you'd have in Toronto or or Montreal\nAnd so we have to change this for ... for the electric to understand what's going on I think there was\nClose to two hundred names on the ballot without really much information about who to vote for so this does have an impact on participation and we have to change it it was the area specialty fair me as an academic at Simon Fraser university so this is what I'll be working with the province to get the changes here\nOkay Mr Stewart thanks very much and good luck thank you very much for your call\nKennedy's Stewart is the mayor elect in Vancouver and after we recorded that interview mayoral candidate can Sam did concede to Vancouver election Mm\n\n\n\nDairy farmers across Canada could use a little tearing up for the most part they are not happy with our new trade deal the U.S MCA but when the strengths gets too much they can pour a glass\nThat's when the transcripts too much they can pour a glass of buttermilk put their feet up and ... and new coffee table book full of gorgeous glamour shots of cops and not to be dismissive of their plight in any way\nThe book is a promotional tools for Boyce Thompson the owner an operator of each side holds teens in Prince Edward island and we reached Mr Thompson in Charlotte town\nMr Thompson these are not your usual snap shots of house can you describe some of them to me\nThere are some of our better genetic\nCows and other kinds of we sell breeding stock crime and so we just take them or to cool spots when we have the professional photographer in our area and uh it's kind of how we do our marketing doing these scenic shot just to kind of attract more attention to our firemen ...\nSo it's a form of advertising absolutely yeah so you can you describe some of them to me\nThe last ones we took a we're at a\nAt would islands prints are to Ireland and where the ferry connects P. I. and over Scotia and uh we tried to get a picture with the couch with a fair in the background and uh\nAnd we got a really good picture of that and then we did a few more other Senate jobs with the White House and\nIt was a really hot day that there was one of the hottest days in the summer so the cat was kinda overeating on us so we decided to take her into the into the ocean\nI guess [laughter] and uh the\nOften the photographer so this amazing a ... shot and she screamed hold the calorie air and she ran into the water\nScreen hold the calorie her and she ran into the water with her camera and uh she took that amazing shots at getting a lot of attention now\nThere is also one that we are super models that there is also one in front of the provincial legislature why they're\nAh it's well it's a it's a trademark of printed island in Charlotte town and uh [noise]\nYou just showed up on Saturday morning so we just went and took the picture and it turned out really good friends are out on the full of beautiful spot so we've tried to cover the island and um scenic pitchers so\nNow when you're taking the photographs of the cows oh what what kind of reaction is that as well is it some of the people around\nUh they love it or we usually do it during ... tourist season so there's always a people shopping pitchers and asking us what we're doing and then they they just admire it and they asked to\nIf they could at the cow and stuff like that so yeah it's kind of it's pretty neat reaction\nWe've done sunrise shots on the beach in the morning and uh\nWe've walked by a couple of sleeping on the beach and they kind of woke up with a\nPretty big surprise but it's pretty neat stuff that that was much more sort of a romantic shot\n[laughter] yeah that was the sunrise it turned out really nice\nSo it's sort of challenges or does your photographer having taking these pictures I mean you know you're not exactly as you say working with top model\nYou know you're not exactly as you say working with top models\n[laughter] to keep the cows attention is pretty hard because there's a lot of things going on which there are there out of their comfort zone or when they're on the news and uh\nBut most of them are show so they're very well trained and a ... a Halter broken and everything but it's just to uh you know you get them to look at the right direction she loves to get through years pop pop the head and stuff like that or\nShe is she's amazing Vicki Fletcher she's she's been doing it for Twenty years for us and this is your son yeah she's one of the best and are probably one of the best dog in the world prompted you to do this we've been known for Twenty years um\nPeople have done it before and you know if there's read magazines out there that we tried to get the cover of afraid so that's how it started I Believe and uh so now we just kind of do it for fun every year and a couple of times here will\nSlowly cow on a trailer and we'll go for drives everywhere we go where we end up\nHave you ever thought of doing a cow calendar\nCalendars or I don't know if anybody by scholars anymore but I think we'll do a coffee table book has kind of what we're we're thinking of doing for\nRight now this is coming when Canadian dairy farmers are I'm Upset and angry about the new trade deal with the United states and Mexico how do you feel about what's happening\nHad witnessed two of them\nAnd where do you all incidents that you had clearly remembered as well\n[laughter] right so that was the one of the extraordinary things about this email was I had not recalled I'm to the incidence he mentioned so one was the incident that I had written\nAnd to the incidence he mentioned so one was the incident that I had written about in the ... which was um it was a a group I was groped in the back of the car there were two other people there um and the other two were not\nAnything I had remembered one was another groping which had happened at a at a dance and the other was um [noise] he had said he had kind of a close the door and a bathroom while we were in their together and would not let me until I kissed him which he said I did\nSo I wrote him back and said you know I I don't remember these things I Believe you\nBut I don't remember them and I felt it was really important and kind of ironic if you think about it that I felt I needed to say to him I Believe you\nKnow in the course of the me too movement which has been just a bit over a year old now we've seen many men apologize after being public ... and for you what was it like having this experience of someone apologizing without having been named her shamed or in some ways sort of forced into it\nYeah so so there are two things about his apology one was um and this really did hit me the fact that she did not have to do this I mean he could have\nAnd I wrote this in the ... the follow up piece that I that I wrote he could have read the piece recognized himself and thought I Wonder what's for dinner tonight you know and\nAnd he could have been quite confident that I Would move on with my life as I had for the past Thirty years and not you know really talk about it anymore and he didn't have to fess up and also the kind of\nHe didn't have to fess up and also the kind of\nTone and content of his apology was\nIt was exceptional it was complete vulnerability he did not say you know I did this thing but I and I I was just a kid or I didn't know any better or that's\nJust how it was back then he said I did these things he lifted them very very clearly he said I have no excuse I feel terrible I have thought about this in the intervening years I've always wanted to reach out to you and apologize and he just said I'm Sorry\nYeah well and obviously he there was a level of trust with you and for him to be able to do that on some level I mean one of the things that struck me um in in reading your column about this is you don't say whether or not you accepted his apology\nThe the the the last line in in in your column and when you receive you're talking about receiving the apology and you're you're right and that is something I can guarantee I won't forget\n'em why did you choose not to let us know when and of course I'm curious do you accept his apology\nYeah so I I Do accept that I Do accept it and I think that's a big way forward\nIn terms of the me too movement I don't think all women need to\nNeed to let all men off the hook for their actions mhm and I I don't believe that however I think there is a lot of there's a lot of power that women have in freeing men\nThat women have in freeing men who are able to come to the point that this man was able to county which is to say to recognize the wrong to address the wrong ... making making apologizing okay I think it's a really powerful thing\nLeslie thank you so much for talking with me today\nThanks for having a little unsure\n[noise] we reached Leslie low in Halifax is low is a columnist with the Halifax Harold Mm\n[noise]\nIt was one small step for a marathon man and a big leap for the Canadian men's record time\nWhen camel Evans cross the finish line at the Toronto waterfront marathon yesterday\nHe not only completed his first marathon he smashed or record that had been on the books for forty three years Mr lemons time two hours nine minutes twenty five seconds was forty four seconds faster than the Canadian men's previous record it to our ten minutes nine seconds\nWhich Mr lemons sat incidentally after recovering from a serious foot injury this morning camel Evans spoke with Matt Galloway hosted metro morning CBC Toronto about\nIt's MORNING camel Evans spoke with Matt Galloway hosted metro morning CBC Toronto about the record performance\nAh I'm I'm a little bit for sure especially uh just the early turnaround are leaving this morning but I'm looking forward to a bit of a break here and uh I'm sure I'll feel great after a couple of weeks\nGoing into this race this is your first marathon you had had a great career before this point but a marathon is completely different um what were your expectations\nI knew I was a very fit and uh I thought\nIf things went well like it a run a good time maybe get close to that record but it's like you said the marathon is a different beast and uh they're just so many things can affect it outside of your control and especially being my first one I just is very very unknown to me\nWhy did you want to go from running shorter distances to running the marathon\nI think it's a natural transition for a lot of a distant athletes like myself running the five game tend to be on the track\nBut for me I had a very serious surgery on my left ankle in middle of twenty sixteen\nAnd um I actually had some difficulty doing track where it goes from that point on just handling the corners of track\nAnd so it was just sort of a natural fit that I could do a little workouts that the marathon required a little bit easier it was just easier on my body as a result I just ah really took to the training and as a continued on I I Love the corporation and I'm like I'm ... now\nIn that recovery me you had as you mentioned serious foot injury um do you run for a long period of time were you concerned that there was a point that maybe you wouldn't be able to run at all I\nDon't think I ever face that but I think that was very serious concern with the surgery I mean you can never do you want to come back from something serious like that back can't be an option but I I had serious doubts\nFrom something serious like that back can't be an option but I I had serious doubts different points in my recovery to vote whether I wanted to continue to do this you know it's very hard road to come back from\nThis record drones ratings record stood for forty three years and people have gotten close to the records they've almost beating the record and then because of the marathon and the fact that it's a long race and anything can happen some things have happened and it's falling apart at what point in the race yesterday or did you start to think seriously that you might have it in your size\nThe reality is I didn't know exactly how close I was into probably the last few kilometers and I knew with an absolute certainty that I had it with about five hundred years left but up to that point it was\nAnything good slap and I are completely blow it so but yeah by that point I was definitely just enjoying and they knew that\nThat was a runner now marathoner can lemons speaking with and CBC traumas mad Galloway this morning yesterday Mr Eleven's broke the forty three year old Canadian men's record low running his very first marathon in Toronto\nThat decades old record was set by drone drink and at the foo ... marathon in Japan and Nineteen Seventy five\nThe following year after he won that marathon for a third time Mr Dayton spoke with CBC morning side hosts Harry brown and Maxine cook about what it took to win\nA sunny day with her a bit on the show normally when I've been there and a pack side have been rainy or quality or or similar type of weather\nYeah I saw a picture where are you wearing sunglasses death or what [laughter] pretty unusual to him that\nWell on my either currently on here\nWell I my eyes are fairly unusually sensitive to ah to sunlight so when they found out I have to wear sunglasses\nWhat are you doing in Honolulu [laughter] thinking in the sun and the terror now you started off you ran for about cutting to the report I bet you're un for about five kilometers in the pack a yet that and and\nWhere are you sending up in your own mind what your pace would be at that stage\nUh yeah so my my plan was to run it as hard as powerful a well not ... but uh well on the five minutes from out of from the beginning a first\nFive ... they give you time uh every five kilometers mark ... for the first five kilometers should use to to warm up like the let the system warmer Bradley and then also to find out from the time to what kind of take Iran I was about ten seconds\nBehind that a marker a so I put on a a a harder effort\nFor the next five kilometers but I ended up with the same time which indicated to me right away that this was not going to be a very fast marathon I think the reason for that because I hadn't been able to do enough speed or a a a around twenty eight kilometers I started to feel really good myself and then I started to push there is a point a", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city":
