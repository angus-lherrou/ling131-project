as it happens\n[noise]\n\nTonight waiting on the swings a handful of US Senators on the swing votes who will determine whether judge Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed I guess is among hundreds in Washington pressuring her senator to vote no\nEnding demonic possession very soon hundreds of Canadians will have a criminal record for something that will not be illegal possessing pots so when he is set up to change that\nNever far from the surface a Nineteen Twenty one massacres still Hans Tulsa, Oklahoma and now the mayor says he'll investigates possible existence of mass graves of murdered African Americans\nNo exit earlier this week an exile Saudi journalist entered his country's consulate in Istanbul since then neither he nor a convincing explanation\nHas emerged covering a track the as it happens theme song challenges open to anyone who knows the music you're hearing right now backwards and forwards although you\nShould performers forwards and uh\nYou should perform it forwards and shoulder to cry on and on about\nActually her opponents have cried about each other elements keels arms pulls a which she is about the use of the world arm wrestling championships as it happens the Thursday edition radio who's guess sorry sometimes tough to come to grips with [noise]\n\nThe FBI probe is complete and today our by our US Senators from each party have had the chance to review the single and confidential copy of the bureau's report into allegations of sexual assault by judge Brett Kavanaugh\nOn surprisingly perhaps the two parties interpreted the findings very differently here is what Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell had to say earlier today so what are we are\nOne of the facts and evidence tell us after seven ... investigation [noise]\nThe fact is that these allegations have not been cooperating with al ... been corroborated by the seventh FBI investigation [noise] not in the new FBI investigation not anywhere\nSo none of these last minute allegations have been corroborated as his confirm Bobby\nIt was just going from Bob in seventh and layers that beyond us to go after\nThe Sherman ... side of this morning new to the Judiciary Committee or the FBI could locate adding a third party who can attest to any of these allegations\nIs Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell speaking earlier today Senate Democrats had a very different take here as Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nWe as many fears that this was a very limited process that will constrain the FBI from getting all the facts having received a thorough briefing on the documents those fears have been realized [noise]\nSecond I disagree having received this the ... a briefing on all of the documents I disagree with Senator Grassley statements that there was no hints of misconduct\nAnd his fiance was waiting for him outside is that right\nCorrect waiting for him outside um he had given her several numbers to call if he did not come out again indicating that he was a little nervous about going to the conflict in the first place and then uh he did not come out\nWhat did she do how long did you stay there\nSo she said it for several hours after the conflict had close even um and even the next day he went back\nAnd went back with a number of other journalists to a demand has release my understanding is that um she is a not well over the situation\nBut again and there are there have been reports of of journalists that have been gathering particularly the Turkish Arab journalists coalition that is gathering to\nUm to pressure and and demand answers basically\nIs there any chance that he could have left and she didn't know about it\nUm I I'm sure that is what is that when what's on all of our minds right now obviously I'm the Saudi authorities are maintaining that he left the conflicts and or the latest statement and the thing that they're cooperating with Turkish authorities to try to\nFind him on the Turkish official position from the presidential spokesperson is that they have reason to believe that he is still there\nIs that they have reason to believe that he is still there\nAs with all constantly to the local authorities who provides a police forces are those the countries is on the the host country Turkish police who are on the security at the consulate they say they check the security cameras and did not see Mr ...\nLeave the building on foot but they do say that a number of diplomatic cars had been moving in and out of the consulate\nSince Tuesday so\nIs that where your concerns lie\nI'm sure I think there's that and then there are just the concerns that frankly that we're hearing very very different conflicting theories and explanations from the Saudis and the Turkish authorities\nThem from our efforts at the at the post you know we really receptive both um Saturday in Turkish authorities and we hope that uh the Turks can\nPressure there Saturday counterparts for information for answers I'm I'm sure in an ideal situation a there are CCTV CCTV cameras and then you know show us that the tapes if if the Saudis are saying is true that a ... I'm actually did leave then there should be evidence of that\nWhy would Saudi Arabia take him I wouldn't be detained them all 'cause she'll be\nSomeone who's worked with them and in fact I just saw him a few weeks ago here in Washington where he's been living for about the past year or so\nI yeah it's been critical of the Saudi Government and in particular the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman obviously this is all happening against the backdrop of a wave of crackdowns a dissent in Saudi Arabia\nA just a few days ago some of them out of the economist was I'm charged with a terrorism after being detained for nearly a year as well um women activists plenty of uh\nCharged with a terrorism after being detained for nearly a year as well um women activists plenty of other journalists and clerics I'm so this is a ... a mystery surrounding demolish happening against this this backdrop\nAnd um you know we were publishing Lawrence's pieces\nAnd Arabic and I do know that that ah it's something that the Saudi authorities are sensitive to 'em but again I think what Jamal always told me that he did not want to be labeled as a dissident or as a a an opposition journalist\nHe really just wanted to write it off in a lot of his his work was even advising Mohammed bin Salman\nAbout here's what I think you should do we forget that that Jamal was a it was formally over a royal family advisor at one point um\nSo uh it is it is really quite stunning I'm quite studying to see what's been happening in the kingdom in general just sitting there and tolerance for dissent um could make Jamal the target absolutely\nAs you point of view was formerly he was an advisor to the royal family so what what ... what changed and why why was he why did he turn against this particular regime\nSo and it has the very first piece that I I commissioned and edited for him last September um the title was a Saudi Arabia was always repressive now it's becoming unbearable\nUm he basically just saw a lot of his friends getting swept up in the crackdowns he saw friends I'm being imprisoned or having traveled lands uh slapped on them\nAnd uh the time you know he he wrote in Saudi Arabia we deserve better than this and this is again a kingdom that is showing even under this new conference total and tolerance for any sort of dissent or or criticism of their policies\nWe know what it is Mohammed bin Salman has consolidated his power he has as you pointed out arrested hundreds\nAs you point out arrested hundreds of clerics activists business people numbers of them were detained outside the country what became of them is there any record of people getting released as there is there a pattern that you might be able to give you hope to Janelle ... my my to emerge from this if he is being detained by the Saudis\nUm that's that's the difficult part again we no we don't have activists fans and journalists and social media stars that\nHave been held for months a year even before being a before being charged with anything so yes I'm very worried but again it's just stay hopeful that keeping in a spotlight on his name and on this case both here in the U.S and abroad can can help for speedy resolution\nAll right we'll be watching herons thank you thank you so so much\nCarnitine is the Washington Post global opinions editor we reached her in Washington DC oh\nIf you go into battle with el material either you're going to end up wobbling down your arms or she will almost certainly do it for you\nMiss ... is an arm wrestler and she is strong in her weight clashes ranked second in Canada with her right arm third with our left\nLater this month she was going to be taken both those arms to turkey where was she will compete against athletes from forty five other countries at the world arm wrestling championships we reached I'm a kill in beach Berg Ontario\nUm uh did you inherit cheered talent for arm wrestling I did for sure who did you get it from\nI got it from both my parents and my grandma\nAnd they were good at arm wrestling they were amazing anonymous [laughter] did you wrestle them\nWell not my grandma but my dad and my mom that firmly and did they usually win well yeah it's more of a respect thing for me\nWhen did you start when did you start to smoke them\nUm well I said to smoke my lawn probably around the age of Eighteen and my dad well he's rarely heritage him\nSo good to practice with your dad exactly and what about that grandmother viewers\nOh she's the brick lane that her age how old is she no she just and their seventies and and to be honest I I'd rather live better age\n[laughter] and and you're you're not wrestling or because you're afraid to yeah [laughter] so you okay\n[laughter] so you okay so obviously comes in with your new inherited but when did you first get interested in competition in arm wrestling\nAbout Fifteen Years old actually\nHeard about ...\nOh my dad and I said well and my mom we were invited on this um it was Alan hit man for he was doing a fundraiser for himself and he said I Will give off camera whoever can beat me\nAnd I had like one free camera right so we went in that and my dad one the camera and they offered by parents to go and train with them\nBut they didn't really know much about myself but I wanted to give it a shot so my dad got me into the practice and they saw a lot of potential and they're like you know what Fifteen Years old and your polling this much do you want to continue with this\nWhat did you think about when they told her that\nIt really was um something huge for me I never really had something as big as this for someone to actually take initiative and me is just a a very a light in the dark hole basically\nWhat about why was the whole dark\nUh I I mean growing up I mean I I really hated my arms my arms were big big arms and I never really liked it because you know dress it didn't fit right church didn't look good I was a world they kid and I just absolutely hated my act\nBe heard that liberal cabinet minister bill Blair yesterday he said that once marijuana is legalized ... as you mentioned October seventeenth he said that the liberal government will address this issue of criminal records in quotes and appropriate way\nAnd we heard Ralph Goodell a public safety ms minister while ago he said the government would look\nTo ways to make things fair so what does all that that that did you think the liberals are supporting your private members bill\nWe're going to find out because I intend to ask them on October seventeenth but honestly I Do hope they do and this is not a partisan issue I think if they characterize it as I Do as a justice issue I'm hopeful they'll they'll do it I think they could have done and should have done when they introduced the kind of a spill in the first place California brought in similar measures Vermont did\nBut I get that they know what I'm saying let's wait until the bill comes into force\nAnd so I'm trying to use this private members bill it as an effort to kind of nudge them to do the right thing I'm hopefully will\nBut if it seems likely that they are going to do what you're proposing then why not just wait for that why why make this noise now has likely just going to evolve in that direction anyways\nMaybe you're more optimistic than I Am certainly talked about\nLikely just going to evolve in that direction anyways\nWell maybe you're more optimistic than I Am certainly talked about this and vague terms I Want to commit them to build this bill is country to several drops with the same kind of legislative draft ers who worked for the the government\nAnd I'm hoping they'll say this is it if they want to tweak it if they want to improve it and run with it nothing would make me happier but I Do not want this to simply linger it seems to me an issue that needs to be addressed because we imposing burdens on hundreds of thousands of Canadians that simply should not have them going forward\nAs we recall that Stephen Harper governance and posed mandatory minimum sentences in six months for uh any pot possession of six plants\nOr less a which I understand the number of people were affected by that we spoke with Jillian than you know that just while ago who is a minister in that cabinet too was supported those mandatory minimum sentences he's now\nIn the business he says that pot is a wonderful therapy for people and it's a great business opportunity what do you say to those who supported this in the past and now see it as an opportunity for them\nWell I'm not going to comment on business decisions that they made and what some would see as a slightly hypocritical position I understand that what you're suggesting but truly this has to be something that the liberals and conservatives support this is something that we should all pass ideally by unanimous\nResolution if possible so we can write this injustice going forward using the conservatives will support you Bill\nI've talked to a couple of the mind the co chair of the justice committees are dealing with the right people and uh I've talked to one so far and I hope that they will I think they get the basic point about the injustice and\nI'm hoping like me that they see that society has changed and the things that might have been treated one way back twenty Thirty years ago is treated in a very different way today we've seen that all over the place in other areas same sex activity\nThirty years ago is treated in a very different way today we've seen that all over the place in other areas same sex activity it was an expungement bill of as you know in the last parliament that dealt with that and those people who had convictions for that activity I think although very different this approach is very analogous\nAll right we'll be watching Mr rank and thank you thank you Murray Rankin is the ... justice critic we reached ...\n[noise]\n\nIn Nineteen Twenty one a white mob attacked a prosperous predominantly African American neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma known as black Wall Street it has been called the Tulsa race massacre and it has been described as one of the worst instances of racial violence in the history of the United states\nOver the years there have been suggestions that there could be mass graves in Tulsa and this week the city's mayor said it would be investigating whether that was in fact the case\nMichele brown works at the Greenwood cultural center and gives historical tours about what happened in Nineteen Twenty one we reach ms Brown in Tulsa has\nBeen has it taken until now for an investigation like this to happen\n[noise] you know that's a great question and I think that we finally have a mayor who is courageous enough to approach the situation in incident and\n... who is courageous enough to approach the situation and incident and to actually move forward and bring initiate the investigation\nWe're talking about an event from Nineteen Twenty one the spring of Nineteen Twenty one that meant that mobs white mob set fire to hundreds of businesses and homes whole city blocks hundreds of people dead ten thousand homeless\nAnd we don't know the whole story so maybe it just to start off tell us\nHow this begin began quite simply didn't\nIt did and it's a story that was all too common\nDuring that period the inflammatory accusation that a young black man had a salted a white woman and an elevator in broad daylight in downtown Tulsa when he got into the elevator as he did every day as a ... boy he was given special permission\nTo go into the truck for building and get water and use the restroom every day he encountered Sarah page on the elevator this particular day after the elevator doors close and\n... page are alone\nThere's a screen from the elevator the elevator doors open and Dick rolling takes off running he's later arrested and taken to the jailhouse slash court house and the accusation is made this our page had been assaulted and has the story circulated throughout Tulsa throughout the day it went from claims that she had been\nAssaulted to she was sexually assaulted by the end of the day they were claiming that she had been raped and this infuriated a mob of angry whites who were determined to take matters into their own hands lynchings were all too common in Tulsa\nDick rolling was arrested and whites began to gather in front of the courthouse angry and upset about what had happened about forty black man approached the court house initially and spoke with the sheriff at that time and offered to help protect the ... and he told them to going back to ... that he had everything under control and the problem would be fun\nAt that time and offered to help protect the girl and he told them to going back to ... that he had everything under control\nAnd the problem would be fine so they did return to Greenwood but some estimates habit that there were as many as ten thousand whites that had gathered in front of the court house last jailhouse later that evening angry and upset determined to take medicine to their own hands\nAnd a group of about a one hundred black men returned and this time a white man approached a black man with a gun and so what are you going to do with that gone he\nSaid I'm going to use it if I have to and they begin to struggle over the gun and during the struggle the gun goes off and at that point they forget all about ... page there's an all out battle in front of the courthouse blast retreat to the Greenwood district\nAnd whites slowly advance towards the Greenwood district eventually breaking through the barriers that African Americans had set up protecting their community but because they were so outnumbered and our gun\nEventually whites are able to overtake the blacks and invade their community and when they do so they invade\nUm Killeen looting stealing and within a short day by the following day more than thirty five square blocks of property has been completely destroyed a thousand homes burned to the ground\nThree hundred black owned homes up three hundred black owned businesses completely destroyed and not only were they were shooting but they were also dropping nitroglycerine bombs from airplanes that had been borrowed from a local oil company\nAnd this has been described in in two thousand and one report by the Oklahoma commission to study who serve race riots is that this was probably the only time that the United states has anybody community than bombs from the air\nThat is correct what\nDo we know about what happened to those those those those remains\nFor what we know is that the entire population of the African American community was ten to twelve thousand six thousand of those people were held in internment camps um that left four to six thousand people on accounted for and we know that\nPeople were held in internment camps um that left four to six thousand people on accounted for and we know that there were people that flat so there's no way of knowing exactly how many people lost their lives but we do believe that um the number is even higher than the three hundred that has been recognized\nWe do not know that there were several mass grave sites that were set up and a lot of that is based on oral histories and what we have been told from not only are survivors\nWe identified a hundred and sixty two survivors in Nineteen Ninety six that began telling their stories but also from whites that wanted to call and speak anonymously about the dump trucks that would drive through the streets of the Greenwood district pick up dead bodies and then go dump them in the Arkansas River\nWe know that there was a mass grave sided Oakland cemetery based on the testimony of a man who happened to be a young boy\nAt the time that the riot took place and he was playing in the area when he saw a group of white men\n... bodies into an open plot at oak lawn cemetery and we did some preliminary investigative work there um years ago and that geophysical surge\nI'm determined that there was a mass grave sites that there was reason to believe that there was a mass grave site where we were not given permission to do the archaeological work that needs to be done um and so we're hoping with this new decision that\nI'm from the mayor to move forward with that investigation that we will finally be able to do a thorough and very complete investigation at least with o clock cemetery we are almost positive that we will find a mass grave site there", "show_name": "As It Happens
