very\nHad some very dark roots Matthew ... is a journalist to cover the rise of ... we reached Matthew Reagan's in New York\n... you know there had been so many failed attempts to assassinate general Abdul magic how come this one was successful how did the assassination take place\nFor the details are still a little unclear but it appears to be um something has happened many other high profile assassinations where there was an infiltrate er or the initial information saying one of the governor's bodyguard actually carried out the attack\nAnd this was the he was shot and heading to a helicopter he was with members of the U.S military\nExactly this is a high level meeting with the top us general in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller\nA he was apparently harmed but outdoor I like the police people killed as was the um spicy or the province of them I mean and it's unclear what's happened with the governors all my we saw who but a ... at least been injured if not killed as well\nAnd so if we say is also dead and some are saying he is but he we we haven't had that confirmed and now the only time you just mentioned Abdul Rashid this is the leadership of Kandahar wiped out in one fell swoop\nYeah it's a devastating blow up for the Afghan government and its shore to make the already dire security situation in the south considerably worse\nSince Nineteen Ninety seven having minimum wage jobs but here's the question then I mean if the if your your belief is that if people have more\nDisposable income when it's all boats will float higher I mean that this'll be good for business why don't businesses and that's why a day\nOr why are they supporting an increase in minimum wage why aren't you pay your workers more the way you know we we we know that the old Ford motors theory was that if you pay people a higher wage they'll buy your product so why why should the government ... why don't you do it\nWell a lot of us are in fact on the ... the question came up and some of the some of the seals spoke today with the queen spark were foreigners minimum wage I I'm One of them some of them thought ... would be better but\nLet's look at the advantages of a basic income over a minimum wage and not seen that we should not increase minimum wage I think we should be screened come would be more universal so people caregivers are entrepreneurs people doing community\nIncrease minimum wage I think we should but the basic income would be more universal so people caregivers are entrepreneurs people doing community service work people doing the economy work what all benefit from the rest of the minimum wage which only applies to a an arrow sector of employment\nSo what's going on with the economy is that it's not that robots will come to take your job or what what is not like what happened to my dad an uncle who lost their jobs in Ontario manufacturing sector it today so today what's happening is that a lot of people just aren't being hired from the beginning\nWhich means which means there's not enough local demand is not enough local high paying work and all the experts I mentioned looking at the future of automation are saying that's going to get a lot worse\nUh so I think we need to look at ... as an economic issue none of social assistance issue it's a way to grow the economy create jobs make low paying work actually work for everyone and so they can compete on a global level and they can actually find find work that suits suits them\nKind of person to see you in your own family or something else when you when you write this letter\nYeah I mean I I have a quite a few stories intersect with me I mean I grew up in a household that had\nA hot domestic violence I Wish my mom had the means to leave and I think if she had to be I think maybe she would we actually see that in in the seventies the base can come in the U.S almost passed under Richard Nixon\nIt it passed in the house and Nixon was going to sign it into law except it some of the experiments running at the time in the U.S and Canada show to an end significant increase in the divorce rate\nAmong married couples who have basic income because women were able to leave abusive households and frankly I think that's a good thing we've also seen that happen in the trials\nIn Africa and Kenya right now a report of a greater marital harmony uh we we've seen in the trials in India for instance women in the villages are taking off their head pieces like dressing more liberally and telling that the researchers that The Elders and the village can't control them any more\nSo when I think we can come as deeply emancipated for women but for everyone because imagine if anyone imagine if you as the listener\nI think they can come as deeply emancipated for women but for everyone because imagine if anyone imagine if you as the listener knew that you would never start if you have this this money coming in and use no shame or on the money is it if everyone gets it if it's universal the wave roads and and and police protection at hospitals are universal there's\nNo shame and using that money to to stop to take a breather figure to think of your life and think of what you want to do next I imagine the confidence the self reliance the the ambition which we can unlock the entrepreneurship it can release if everyone can take a long term perspective on their lives\nWill be watching to see if the Ontario cabinet responds to that in just a man that's good I mean speaking thank you thank you very much\nFloyd ... organized the campaign CEOs for basic income we reached him in Toronto\nAnd we received a statement from Ontario ministry of children community and social services it reads in part quote the government for the people has committed to a one hundred day review of social assistance and poverty reduction strategies in Ontario to best assist the one in seven people in the province who are living in poverty\nPlan is expected on November eight twenty eight team unquote uh\nAbout a year to go before the next federal election many conservatives are on a push to introduce or ...\nServices are on a push to introduce or reintroduce I guess their leader to Canadians and that means that you are going to be seeing and hearing a lot more of Andrew sheer on this weekend the Sunday Edition we'll be hearing a wide ranging discussion between Mr Sharon Michael and right\nInterview covers a lot of ground here's a patch which in which Michael asks the conservative leader about the disappearance and apparent murder of Saudi journalist Jamal ...\nThe most concerning uh international issue at the moment facing Canada would face you prime minister of course is the the murder the butchery of ... I'm In the Saudi ... in\nIn the is the ... if you are prime minister how would you respond to that would you cancel any arms deals we have with Saudi Arabia\nWell you know I have to uh I have to be caught the fact that I don't have the same levels and briefings that the liberals have in the primary strategies aware of much more to the story than I Am through security and intelligence briefings and things like that\nI Believe though that this incident should be a wakeup call uh about uh the government in Saudi Arabia had about it's it's um [noise]\nAh it's the role it's playing in the world\nI'm I've been reading a lot in this recently and uh it is very disturbing and when you look at what the Saudi Government has has has done in this case the the cover up to follow that\nAh that this is alarming everyone should be concerned about this is that the idea that had happened in a in another country not not in Canada not to again\nAt ... the Saudi Government plays a very significant role in geopolitics uh\nHe's a very significant role in geopolitics uh there are a lot of concerns about uh the sanctioning of of of terrorist groups and and and where the money flows a lot of that has come through\nA entities within within that country and I think that this we all need to get together as as as western democracies liberal democracy I should say western cause effect structures all around the world for freedom loving nations should all come together and say we've got a big problem here if we cannot allow a government\nTo act with impunity in this fashion gruesome horrific ah doesn't begin to describe what happened\nThat is an excerpt of conservative leader Andrew shears conversation with Michael end right which will be on the Sunday Edition this weekend you can hear the full interview on Sunday [noise]\n\n\n\nIn the festivities in Toronto park yesterday there was one character who stood out a tall hairy creature that bore a striking resemblance to poke through the BLM character from the long running TV oh children's program polka dot door\nBut it was four twenty on legalization day in Canada so the creature it was not poker room at all it was to go to the creation of mark Scott who used to play poker roulette special promotional events we reached Scott in Toronto\nFor those who didn't get a chance to see him I just took a look like\nWell ... would be a play on the iconic\nTo see him what is took ... look like\nWell ... would be a play on the iconic poker rule which I've created a parody of and is a character who will talk about responsible drug use now that Canada has legalized candidates\nFor recreational use there can be more discussion about responsible altered states\nHigh and so that to get into the description Doug looks like poker for people who have not seen ... who don't have kids what is Tucker who look like\nWe'll poke who is a poker dotted kangaroo from a show called ... outdoor\nVery popular with everyone who has kids knows about ... ... and it was about ... he didn't know about token now so this is that this is what you you were ... and you I took ...\nYes I was the um ... out of route land for TV oh and they're affiliated agencies and I got to meet the queen as poker rue I'm Colin Powell came to bring a program called America's Promise with a little red wagon as their symbol\nAnd um ... when he had his twenty fifth anniversary Saturday Night at the movies I I got to be part of that\nWill that now we never got to hear your voice which is really odd hearing it now\nWell yes because poker room or in most of the time until Nineteen Ninety six when he came out of re land talking was a\nSort of in some ways and when I was told to talk I was given the instruction to be kind of like Julia Child and Kermit the frog [laughter] so it was a roof and yes mostly insinuating like this Merce did in their day\nRight now 'cause we didn't imagine ... ah smoking a giant split with\nNo and uh that would be the evolution of the next\nIt was smoking a giant split with\nNo and uh that would be the evolution of the next generation where token route and rainbow grew signature route who is death and does signing and radio ... who is a special needs character\nSo this was a project that I've evolved the character from in into an Internet program for eight to thirty year olds\nHow do people react you at the the the Ford twenty has today that said his well this big rally yeah and um you were there as token view as they may just mentioned you were smoking a giant novelty splits and how do people react to you\nAnd with the honesty and he has charged vice admiral Norman with is criminal region fast for allegedly seeking to keep the day the contact on of course you have a ... and colleagues since adjusted these charges ... based on what\nYou have a ... and colleagues since the death to these ... based on what I'm\nI have learned through the media that\nThere were investigations into leaks of cabinet secrets\nSurrounding the new Trudeau cabinet and their decisions and that apparently some cabinet documents were leaked but charges were not brought for breach of trust against some other civil servants it appears that\nThere was a targeted campaign against admiral Norman he is the one facing trial no one else is even though the investigation revealed there were several leaks around liberal decisions on on ship building he deserves\nAs any Canadian would do a full answer in defense writes both under section seven and eleven of the charter it you know the the Trudeau government uh talks a lot of a sunny ways and transparency they have the ability to ensure that all documents released we don't care what's in them\nThat will be determined by a court so that he can get a fair hearing\nAnd they know the story was originally published by CBC News journalist at that time was James had more who went to work for a defense minister ... ... just weeks after that story was published is that what you're referring to\nThe that's part of the intrigued with this story Carol and you know Mr cut more of a reported on defense issues and had served briefly in the armed forces I Believe was aware of of some of these discussions then went and worked internally I Know he wouldn't have been at the cabinet meetings what we're driving at his\nWord there any discussions involving a Mr Bryson Mr Trudeau other members of the cabinet with respect to this contract where they advancing concerns that they'd heard from interested parties all of this deserves transparency I think ah\nWhen someone's reputation and literally there's liberty is on the line we should air in favor of making sure his charter rights are respected\nVice admiral Norman is that these ended by Murray hadn't and very very good defense lawyer with ...\nIt's very very good defense lawyer with a reputation for success or is it possible that this political interference doing it's just a part of the defense lawyer my degree down in the ... case against declined\nThere is no question he has very capable council and in fact Mr Goodell said today in the house that our system works when things are left in the hands of defense counsel the trouble is the liberal governments are tying the hands of defense counsel\nBy not providing documents that are central to the case if the trust that was breached in this case\nIs the trust and confidence around decisions a cabinet sorry you have to release\nThose documents to see if indeed trust or minutes her cabinet memos were leaked the government can't have it both ways they basically ran\nA very respected senior officer out of the military on a rail I respect the fact he's standing up for his reputation he wants to return to duty if the liberals are prepared to release these documents they should ensure that the the charges are dropped because it's a farce\nI Will leave it there we will be following this story misspelled tool thank
