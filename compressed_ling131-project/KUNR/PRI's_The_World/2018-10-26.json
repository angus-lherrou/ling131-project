wearing lapel pin that had Xi Jinping's face on them or the Chinese flag they call each other comrade are sort of the patriotism fever among them\nAlso seemed as though they enjoyed dominating the spaces of leaders like in a restaurant for instance if there's a long wait for food they would demand that they'd be served first\nSo it seems as though they were taking up the position of the occupier or you know to conquer kinda enjoying the privilege that they now have there certainly are resonances echoes with earlier projects to control unwanted populations\nThe way they frame their final solution is lasting stability or long term security\nBut it's quite big we don't know exactly what that looks like it seems as though they're thinking that the whole people for a generation
