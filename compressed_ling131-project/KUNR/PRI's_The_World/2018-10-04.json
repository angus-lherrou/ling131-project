time today all of our cell phone started beeping at once and flashing this text message presidential alert this is a test of the national wireless emergency alert system no action is needed\nAlmost all Americans saw that on their cell phones today it was a test by FEMA the federal emergency management agency for a system that the president could use in case of a national emergency got us thinking about how other countries do the sort of thing and the world's Lydia amen Alito looked into that\nOr is this something governments do is this normal\nAround the world yeah it's it's something many governments do around the world I they use these systems for an agency announcements everything from natural disasters too missile warnings\nAnd I gather Lydia here in the U.S there have been a quite a few privacy concerns about how the government's going to use the system\nYeah that's right there was actually a federal lawsuit was filed last week by the people they want it to block that

government control loud speaker in the home of every person a FEMA has said though that the system will only be used in the case of national emergencies\nSo I Want to go to how other countries use these kinds of emergency systems but first I Want you to tell us how long the U.S has been doing this sort of thing\nSo the first national emergency warning system started under President Harry Truman ah in the early fifties the early days of the Cold War\n[laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\nIt was time to learn that Americans have benefited attacks and it had this crazy name a tunnel rad that

first time that system is being tested\nDo other countries ... include cellphone alerts\nYeah there there are quite a few countries actually uh in the Netherlands for example people receive text when their national emergencies Australia has a system where the government\nCan send warnings to test\nOr a voice messages if you have a landline\nEvents type those tornado for Lindsey southern called

their cell phone [noise]\nAnd one more example I Want to mention is France because earlier this year they announced a plan to start doing some to start doing some of this warning through social media a so that means that when you log on social media there's a national emergency going on that warning shows up at the very top of your feet so it's very visible\nBut at the same time France like many other countries I looked into still holds on to some of the more old school methods for warning citizens when there are\nNational nor do they have this uh air raid siren network or that\nThe radio and
