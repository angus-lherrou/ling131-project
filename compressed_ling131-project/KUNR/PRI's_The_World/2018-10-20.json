that all the migrants for traveling together but then it became so big so huge that it became\nSo big so huge that it became incredibly dispersed I write to Guatemala yesterday and I made my way to a shelter in a city called ... the main goal\nWhen I was told us that roughly seven hundred hundreds had arrived yesterday and so the idea of a caravan as one might think of it is not really accurate it feels to me more like a mass of thousands of people traveling right now to the Mexico Guatemala border\nI mean it sounds just like a very long line of people as many as four thousand though I mean that that's a pretty dramatic\nIt's completely a dramatic where I was last night was at a municipal sports center it was like a basketball court was bleachers and they were just hundreds of people in it sleeping\nEating and it was loud and it kind of smelled of human sweat and what really stood out to me was just how many kids do work\nAnd I'm not just talking teenagers are ten year olds I'm

think that's still the vast majority of people are ... I Know that there are also of Salvadorans and I think Guatemalans are also joining\nAnd most of them say they are leaving because there's simply no opportunities and also just intense violence that affects their everyday lives I talked to a woman this morning who said her husband had been murdered three months ago and and her story is not unusual\nSo aside from stories of violence what else are you hearing from some\nSo aside from stories of violence what else are you hearing from some of the migrants so I Know you've had the chance to speak with some of 'em [noise]\nWhat's really stood out to me is that this is not something that most of the migrants plans what they say to me as they saw on the news or they saw on Facebook that the caravan was passing and they said we're going to take this chance\nOr in the case of twelve year old Mario ... who I met on the road traveling alone he said he saw the caravan passing by and he decided to join\nHis father's out of the picture on his mom is sick and Honduras and I asked Mario I said to him you know what's your plan your here by yourself what are you going to do and this is what he told me\nHe had any time [noise]\nRight there what are you same to me is my plan is to get to the United states to study and then work and I asked him what does he want to go in the United states doesn't he doesn't know I mean his desire is to leave Honduras and I think that it's hard to fathom yeah [noise]\nAnd by babble a European made language learning program babble teaches practical conversation in Spanish French German and other languages\nAvailable in the app store or online at babble B a B B.

I'm\nIn a way that has kept it in the news every day\nSo how much of a problem is it for journalists both foreign and Turkish to report the Turkish findings when the people in charge of the scene of the crime the Saudis are not really corroborating anything right now\nVery difficult I mean that's you know and and it remains this mystery in many ways there's no thought now that's coming out in the Turkish press which we can't completely dark ...\nMystery in many ways there's no ... now that's coming out in the Turkish press which we can't completely dark five to one of the one of the things was that the record the audio recordings maybe came from his apple watch\nThat was quite quickly shut down by technical acts but I'm the photos that were released of the Fifteen Saudis who are being accused of being scored who flew in the sense that day and flew out that day we had teams in New York and they were checking ... to try and match them with\nOpen source materials social media and stuff and so on we found people who are easily recognizable from\nA you know the entourage of ah the crown prince of Saudi Arabia mum had been someone they caught on um you know photographs news agency photograph so those are the things we will to match up there are others that it's difficult to walk out who they are all\nThese leaks ah have gotten a lot of attention in part because the killing is reported to be hideous and a ... he was tortured some are going to see this as a threat not something that went around by ... in your reporting have you come close to understanding this\n[noise] um no not yet I mean I think the first we need to find what exactly happened and then perhaps we move on to why and why in this way but\nYou know this wasn't a a a shooting in a dark alley um that could be pinned on no one this was a very brazen attack and so I think the Turks have been tucked should that as a threat against them against our own government and president I'd run himself so that's why that particularly in range die thing\nAnd so now people are looking at the relations between turkey and Saudi Arabia which although this sudden diplomatic deference they do have differences considerable differences\nAnd so now you see in the pro government columnist quite a lot of anger spilling out a victory and demands that um the crown prince\nUm this quite a lot of anger spilling out um to clearly undermines the um the crown prince you remove so it's it's gone going very high\nCarlotta Gall to New York times bureau chief and assemble thanks very much for being with us pleasure to be with you\nMm\n\nHurricane Michael is gone but the recovery is just beginning Michael tore through the south east us last week a powerful storm likely made even more powerful by climate change\nAmong the places that took a direct hit tend to air force base in Florida to not just one of many us bases around the world that are vulnerable to be growing impacts of climate change\nBut as the world's Carolyn Beeler reports the military is not tracking those costs\n[noise] is it found that over the ripped off at building it in the air force base and swung sleepy air in ... like ...

extreme weather or climate change because that doesn't exist\nI think it is fair to say that the military does not know what the costs of climate change will be going forward\nJohn konger he oversaw environmental policy and managed facilities for the department of defense during the Obama administration last year the government Accountability Office recommended that the military start tracking\nLast year the government Accountability Office recommended that the military start tracking the costs of extreme weather and climate change at all their installations Brian ... wrote that

future adaptation projects\nLook argues it's a lot easier to justify the cost of an adaptation project like strengthening a hanger roof if you know how much you've spent repairing hang our roots in the past and how much more you might spend in the face of increasingly intense storms and he points out it's not just about the money\nWe have military bases to support a military mission and if the base is out of commission by definition is not supporting the military mission\nThe department of defense responded to the watchdog agency is called to track climate and extreme weather costs by saying no thanks actually they did say a little more they responded that quote associating a single event to climate change is difficult and does not warrant that time and money expended in doing

estimate how much more likely it is at a given building a experiences extreme weather events now than it was Thirty years ago and how much more likely it will be in the future and what the price tag is\nFiguring out how much damage climate change is currently costing the military nearly five thousand sites around the world wouldn't be cheap but Hauser says it'd be totally doable\nI mean I don't know exactly what it would cost but I'm guessing it would cost them washed then you know half of a wing of why they're sixteen fighter\nA department of defense spokesperson told the world they plan

know for kids it's never easy arriving at a new school and then you face these regulations that alienated from other classmates have you spoken with immigrant families and did they tell you how the kids are dealing with this\n[noise] I did speak to a mother you know do the she came from Tunisia and she was telling me that she fell you mediated she felt you know she was angry she was seriously you know disappointed\nAnd humiliated by a little sign by politicians were totally aware of the conditions for migrants in lowly so they felt the was injustice and it's very hard for them to express

cops but for ice as an immigration and Customs Enforcement you know show would follow ice agents around as they conduct raise looking for suspected undocumented immigrants\nAnd the purpose of this t._v. show uh sensibly entertainment you may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson has seen it he's Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality cop show in this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess these over stairs or people who are\nWorking against the terms of of their views in Japan and stake out people you're there with him in the car um they they capture them interrogate them and then um as the title of the show suggests there deport him in the next plane type\nThing wow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or translation and English\nIn Japanese it's called a hike during the shooting Kahn which I guess translate says Koch at the moment of deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show or in Japan called a ... ... which is like caught at the moment of harassed sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada\nBrian from for example uh we had a show like this that Canada border services agency cooperated with with the producers and actually the Kenyan government help funded and so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless and it was only taken off the air because of the uh\nThe contravene privacy regulations Canada\nWhat is the tone of the the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very literate and breath was um\nProgram and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very literate and breathless um when you eat you basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening it's it's it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and in writing pleasant so now the the immigration agents are on their way to a\nDormitory where some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of hiding out in and then they sort of narrative and say it's a very um you know cinema verite say you're you're with ... with them in the car there is a a camera\nYou know you're driving down the road and it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan\nAlso has very stringent privacy regulations you can't really show anybody's face so everything is blurt out including the like the neighborhood where it is\n'cause like like say if you show the neighborhood um the people who live there would probably complain in ... create a slash and so it's just like this is like an hour and a half of what worry blurred out\nImages you can't see people's spaces voices they're disguised as quite an odd program\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is that a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be um because ah the the program did to cooperate with ah the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl\nSo they leave I mean there's people who put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to an immigration agency and get more resources I'd assumed is going to be somewhere PR efforts like this too\nI gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan or what have active it's been saying [noise]\nI mean yeah I like on line there is considerable backlash from anti racism activists who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant anti racism a movement and so yeah they they basically said why turning this into the entertainment like why why you showing people being deported\nHow can this be entertainment and then um\nInto the entertainment like why why you showing people being deported how can this be entertainment and then um be the mainstream media picked it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot in front of 'cause I mean like the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstayed their work permits\nWell I mean I guess it'd be the obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have biases about people from other countries the uh they don't speak our language or they look a bit different and and they're coming over here and in taking our jobs type thing so I I'm but personally I I'd much surely a\nI think it's just a kind of a ... sensational kind of a cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended it by getting samples all over the place that they have a a catchy theme tune that everybody's not singing [laughter]\nYeah I mean I I guess you you might think also we live in a time when around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because of a say for example Donald Trump for\nBrexit or\nInvasion of Crimea so maybe people are just feeling I'm less secure in their own country and so perhaps these sorts of shows provide some reassurance that someone's doing something to protect us here\nNevin Tom Cindy Japan editor for global voices thank you very much for telling
