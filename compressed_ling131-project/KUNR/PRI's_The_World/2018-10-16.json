it gets more tilted the circle spreads out right now we're somewhere in the middle of that cycle heading closer to straight up and down so the Arctic Circle is moving north and for Iceland this means that it's slowly slipping away grooms he is currently the only habitable spot in the country touched by the Arctic Circle\nAnd that's drawn tourists here for decades as the Chrysler\nDescribes what they did his you know just when you arrived in the plane is that it was assigned the maid of honor many dots where the ... will walk from around the sign gives them a certificate and send them back home again\nIn twenty Thirteen the local government decided this simple Arctic Circle Margaret was due for an upgrade so they launched a competition and like Christian said earlier the information they put out said that the Arctic Circle is moving fourteen centimeters a year\nBut stores team told them it was actually moving a whole lot more than that an average of fourteen meters a year in the spot and at that rate the Arctic Circle only touched currency for a few more decades\nCharging more for them to leave the island and looking forward to show even within the country loses or more\nAfter that the Arctic Circle will leave all of Iceland behind for thousands of years until the earth access begins to swing back in the other direction this was not great news for the people have ... they'd always been told the Arctic Circle ran through the middle of their island\nWith when we moved ... than usual this is true [noise]\n\nSteven Christian realized they had a decision to make sick and ignore the science of how the Arctic Circle actually works and just make another stationary monument in the same old place\nMake another stationary monument in the same old place or they could that this new information reshape their whole idea for the monument and as you've no doubt gassed they decided the complicated facts were much more interesting than a nice easy fiction\nSo so everything is changing so often and he's only move so we had lots of different ways of representing just moments and then gradually it crystallized into something as simple as a sport because it's something you can move and it also represents\nWhat we're wrong because everything that we're talking about thinking about is actually affected by ...\nOkay so some kind of ball something that rules but also something that doesn't roll too much grins he is a really windy place\nIt has to have a certain presidents and certain physicality a certain weight\nSo an enormous mall of concrete ... tons it's three meters in diameter or about nine feet\nSo it's it's bigger than us now there was the thing that we realized that has to be\nBig enough to be something that you couldn't put your arms wrapped it even if five people linked ... it'd be it'd be having a struggle so it's it's something you you can't contain it has its own life does its own thing and we just have to follow them unlike now even though we know he's going north this summer it will go south\nYep you heard that right it's even more complicated the Arctic Circle isn't only moving in one direction the moon has an effect to ... says that has the earth's axis ways back and forth about twenty thousand years in each direction there was a much smaller faster wobble\nSouth in years in each direction there is a much smaller faster wobble happening as well this one is caused by the moon\nOn is should be the most Eighteen going to choose\nWhat it comes down to is this the movement of the Arctic Circle isn't a straight line it's a squeeze all a big line moving in one direction with a bunch of smaller little ... and then just when I thought I really understood what was going on or seen said this\nRegard it as one factor comes into his own people remember finger burger of Arthur used the movements of the U.S crushed this is something we called produced very accurately\nPieces of the earth's crust are also moving in that throws another wrench in the works I have to say as I was learning all this my heart kind of went out to Steve and Kristin and the competition organizers\nIt seemed like a simple challenge make a monument to the Arctic Circle on his tidy little line the human beings and drawn around the top of the earth\nBut the deeper these two went into it the more complex it became\nBut I think that's also something you accept as you get older you realize that you don't have a grasp on everything the older you get the more you realize you don't know\nThis kind of thing happens to all of us this moment when we learn something new that makes everything so much harder and more complicated than we thought and then we have to decide if we're going to take that in our turn away\nThis happens a lot with climate change as we learn about how our own actions are impacting the climate for some of us it can get so overwhelming that will grab on to any alternative story anything that helps us just to turn away and one of those stories is actually related to this story it's a narrative that says the planet\nThose stories is actually related to this story it's a narrative that says the planet is heating up because of changes in ... and other natural processes not our carbon pollution you may have heard this yourself and wondered\nCould there be anything to that so let's take a quick look\nFirst of all the earth's climate does of course change naturally the planet has always fluctuated between ice ages and warmer periods and changes in ... are part of what drives that pattern\nBut those changes play out over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years\nThe warming we're experiencing now is happening at lightning speed in comparison we can measure it in decades\nAnd the cause of that warming is clear it's us burning fossil fuels moves carbon into the atmosphere and not traps more heat this is a fact so we have a choice do we try to push it aside so that we don't have to change or do we accept the truth as difficult as it might be\nWhen it came to making this Arctic Circle monument Steven Kristen chose option number two they open themselves up to the more complicated truth [noise]\nAnd it turned out to lead to something pretty darn cool [noise]\nThis is a moving to information show which which is nothing you can touch or see lots of interesting because the object is following this or do\nThe ... is the least important about\nThe piece itself is a movement what the bull does is it represents the movement\nHumans don't really like change we like sharp lines from definitions but the actual physical world doesn't work\nFinish and but the actual physical world doesn't work this way it's really hard to find a straight line in nature instead they're occurs twists and blurred boundaries and always always change\nEverything every single thing that showed that\nEven it turns out the Arctic Circle and an eight ball of concrete both of which are scheduled to leave the island in the year twenty forty seven\nI'm not swimming Christian and I go up there with ... frames and kick it into the ocean\n[laughter] what it says Walker agreeing okay [laughter]\n\nSo the question we started with here is what is the Arctic the answer anything above the ... line which fluctuates between sixty five and a half and sixty eight degrees north which is so messy and complicated there's really nothing about the Arctic that all these are rules\nFor the world I'm Amy Martin frenzy Iceland [noise]\nAmy's reporting as part of our partnership with the threshold podcast
