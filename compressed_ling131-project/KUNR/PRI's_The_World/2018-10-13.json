sabotage of our country's defenses by people hacking into them it's a size five scenario but it may not be that far from reality that\nAt least is the warning coming this week from a new report from the government Accountability Office found that the country's next generation weapons systems could be easy targets for cyber attacks\nThat made some experts in the field think about the TV show Battlestar Galactica [noise]\nIn it an enemy civilization has taken out humanities entire fleet of fighter jets find affecting their computers the Gmail report found real life on her abilities and us defense systems Emily Dr ... has been covering this for wired Emily one of the weapons systems at the center of this report\nVery good an unanswerable question actually this report is written it is an unclassified\nGood an unanswerable question actually this report is written it is an unclassified report but these ... weapons systems are themselves classified so nowhere in this report or the weapons systems themselves named\nWe can do that these are everything from jet fighters to anti missile interceptors and an every kind of weapon system that the Pentagon is developing\n[noise] wow [noise] so so what kind of vulnerabilities did the report find\nAll sorts of vulnerability is the scariest thing I think is that they found that basically an entire generation of Pentagon weapons seems to have been developed without cyber security in mind which means that these aren't necessarily vulnerabilities that are\nOnly for high level hackers to take advantage of these aren't like really hard to get into systems some of these things were just that they found default password hadn't changed on the software\nOf the systems so the testers were able to take over these systems completely just by guessing password in one case it was as simple as guessing a password and nine seconds\nAnd in some in many cases\nThe duty weapons developers did not notice that the testers were in their system acting like hackers and they even didn't notice when the testers we're trying to be intentionally noisy to make themselves visible so that they would be found even then they weren't found\nNow to be clear these are weapons systems that are already deployed or are they things that are being developed and are going to be deployed what what kind of time period we're talking about so we are talking about systems that are being developed the reason\nWhy this report was done by the government Accountability Office was at the Senate Armed forces committee asked them to look into the uh what\nThe government Accountability Office was at the Senate Armed forces committee asked them to look into the\nAh weapons that the DOD wants to spend one point six six trillion dollars to roll out and bring a scales that they can use them so it is likely that some of these weapons systems are already in use but they are going to be rolled out further but many of these are things that are\nBeing developed and are not yet being used\nNow that sounds like one big giant and mess I mean how can this kind of stuff happened\n[laughter] um I think because there is still a real disconnect in understanding how important cyber security is especially even with physical weapons to the gym is report noticed a noted\nGood evening this is key when our eighty eight point seven\nThanks for

Ontario for a very long time\nOr family has been on this piece of land um since aging sixty nine\nObviously dairy farming has lost a lot since then it's also made a huge leap sends Armstrong graduating college thirty seven years ago today each of his three hundred and eighty cows where's the high tech color we watch is twenty four cows getting milk and the computer measures they're out\nThe call or have [noise]\nThe caller that they have on them is id but it also measures her eating habits on an individual count it measures for room in the stomach flu wants to make sure that that's going well it measures are lying down time and measures are activity\nCombine that technology with better breeding and nutrition and Armstrong says his cows are nearly twice as productive as for decades ago\nThis might seem great but it's also created a problem for the world's dairy farmers they're producing too much milk so to keep things in check Canada has a system called supply management\nEach farm has a quota and that's our share of the Canadian Marc\nThey match supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system Canada also places high tariffs unimportant dairy imports up to about three hundred percent that's what's enraged President Trump\nCanada does lead in some American dairy before terrorists kicking and that's part of the updated NAFTA Canada would open up a few percentage points more to the Americans\nYou go okay well it's not much but a role in in income we're giving up that allows us to modernize to expand so it's frustrating for us as dirty partners\nAnd perplexing the dairy trade between the U.S and Canada is a sliver of overall trade between the two nations and Armstrong is annoyed that President Trump singled out Canadian dairy as the problem\nHe was distorting the facts or maybe didn't understand the facts at all no and\n[noise] maybe didn't understand the facts at all no and so if we were hurting their dairy farmers well Americans had a six hundred million dollar surplus with us but he got injured fad that we were mistreating their farmers\nAnd many American dairy farmers agree with President Trump and applaud him for standing up for them they point out that Canada also recently read to find some of its milk products which could effectively shut out American products\nTheir pain is real thousands of small American dairy farms have shut down in recent years it's not all because of Canada far from it they'd been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices people are also consuming less milk a lot of male cat\nIn the past has been a dumped because it couldn't be processed and inappropriate time or sold and extreme discount\nBrian Gould is a professor of agribusiness at the University of Wisconsin well us dairy farmers maybe in a bad place ... says the U.S shouldn't be telling Canada how to manage its agriculture\nWe have no right to do that I I really think we're on thin ice when we demand that they'd get rid of their quota system\nGold says think of the reverse Canada telling us to dismantle its production system the U. S. government sets the minimum price for milk and provide some subsidies\nUs also has its own high tariffs on certain dairy products sour cream for instance it so I think it's I don't know exactly it's like grandma Lloyd the c._e._o. of the dairy farmers of Ontario couldn't put his finger on the exact amount\nThe U.S sour cream tariff is one hundred and eighty seven percent [noise]\nThe U.S sour cream tariff is one hundred and eighty seven percent and Lloyd says there are a lot of other us dairy tariffs on other cheeses and that you have like fifty percent tariffs Lloyd says this whole milk spat with Canada it's just politics\nWisconsin being a significant important state to the Republicans namely obviously Speaker Ryan and it was a state that carried Trump became a political lightning rod and that is what started the whole process\nBack on the farm fill up arms says the new NAFTA agreement doesn't address the fundamental problem American farmers are producing too much milk and Armstrong believes opening a little bit more of Canada will make a dent in that\nYou know I feel for the dairy farmer in the United states is ... what happened is lunar her a fear but it has no impact on their on their wellbeing it all\nAgain plenty of Wisconsin in New York farmers see things differently they're glad to have more access to Canadian\nMarkets still there's an ironic twist here many American dairy farmers and organizations are actually now looking into a supply management system of their own similar to Canada's for the world Jason Margolis Khalid on Ontario\nOoh this week we've been obsessed with what could be a murder story the victim Saudi journalist on October second Jamal ... entered the Saudi Arabian constantly in Istanbul and has not been seen since we're not the only ones obsessed\nInside Saudi Arabia and outside I think we're all trying to figure out what happens I had\nThought I thought um it is a Saudi journalist\nWhat has happened to him so how ... is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker who made a documentary critical of Saudi Arabia she also new Jamal ... like him she live outside the Saudi kingdom because she says speaking up can get you in trouble with the authorities there\nDissidents human rights activists or even just simple critics of what's going on Saturday for the past few years have been put in prison taken from different countries and brought back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd so your mind is the highest profile of something that's been going on inside tied to review for more than a year now let's say and that's the scary thing\nIs I tell us again what happened to you after you produced a documentary\nSo that the government officially accused me of supporting terrorism and so this shows a lack of understanding of the Saudi Government itself of what is independent terminal because there isn't anything called independent journalism and Saudi Arabia and so like for a lot of people even when I was being interviewed about the film\nThere were like how would you like to be identified are you a Saudi dissidents like no I'm a journalist was covering the story\nBut because there is no such platforms and fights had to read that where you can say these things we all become dissidents inadvertently and there was no other space\nAnd this is the problem with with with how the Saudi Government is dealing with everyone right now they are shutting down even the my oldest of comments and critique\nAbout their policies and so they've left no room for us they've left no room for us to be able to properly covers stories and then they love criticizing journalists for not understanding what's going on in Saudi Arabia and so it's a lose lose situation for us\nHas has the government clamped down harder since Mohammed bin Salman a came I Can't lose\nHer absolutely on every one of the ... I mean like ... before you could be a human rights activists on for example woman driving or being\nBefore you could be a human rights activists on for example ... driving or being critical of the economic reform in Saudi Arabia\nAnd the wouldn't be as much backlash as now we thought like a lot of the activists that had been arrested before the ban was lifted that that would be released now instead of being released a lot more pressure has been put on them and they're using them about you know let's say\n... I'm at is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker we've been speaking to her from Washington I think you saw ...\nOh [noise]\nComing up an American pastor goes free in Turkey but only after being found guilty of Karen you're listening to the world\n\nOh\nTo slow them down to that they could land safely they're not spending as they're racing to the earth or yeah they are [laughter]\nGod I've done what is known as a parabolic flight that's when you feel weightlessness for a moment to time and during the ... experience extra cheese and it feels like something is pressing down on you like a mattress\nI didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're ill so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\nAre there any new details about what might have caused this problem I don't know if they've traced\nThe exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separation so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters around the center core and they were supposed to break away\nBut Russian and things that maybe there was some contact between one of the boosters innocent our core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely this was the sixty ... of this particular sways rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter]\nI don't know if they know what caused that contact\nBut I think that's the leading theory at the moment\n[noise] none of us in Russia there frequently at odds especially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight why is that NASA has\nBeen kind of shiny beacon of hope in our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let your politics and\nIn our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics enter no it definitely creeps into other aspects\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine that\nKind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has had an impact on other parts of our space infrastructure but when it comes to NASA we just can't let those things get in a way we need then\nAt the moment because the soy is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not that Russia will let geopolitics getting the way that\nIs significant setback for the international space station\nI Would say it's definitely concerning about the nation's future we currently have three astronauts\nInto orbit on the station and they are going to have to come home eventually day got up there and it's the way it is as well and the Soyuz capsule can't last forever and or but they have a two hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days into\nThat so they're slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that to January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down soon or Russia could possibly launch an empty Soyuz capsule and send that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board but that\nHasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen it just depends on what the investigation finds\nLauren ... is senior science reporter for the verge thinks learn\nThings for having me this next story is also about Russia but guess what it has nothing
