far\nEmily Green it's been on the road with the migrants for the past several days today she's in ... just north of Mexico Guatemala border the very first thing I Want you to tell us Emily is just what you're seeing right now what does this very long line that stretched out over\nSeveral miles of now what five thousand people what does that look like\nNow I'm not an essential part in the city

four thousand migrants making their way north that number has now increased quite a bit [noise]\nYes now the outcome is right around five to seven thousand migrants and I think that's because there are many migrants that were already in Mexico and they decided to join the caravan\nSo the last time we spoke Emily you were in Guatemala just south of the Mexican border and the migrants were trying to cross into Mexico was federal police were sent down to the border just to kind of monitor the situation how did everything go when the actual crossing the border happen [noise]\nRight I mean they did more than monitor they fired tear gas\nThe migrants and then I think from there to make it into society they were going to take raft across the river that was right below\nImmigration checkpoint and immigration forces in Mexico didn't stop them\nSo this crossing did not go really as planned the migrants had to kind of find another route into Mexico\n[noise] yeah they tend to find an alternate route into Mexico when I left ... yesterday there were still about Fifteen hundred migrants on that bridge and they wanted to [noise] quite loud here so\nYou don't tell me what I [noise] I hear

let me ask you about something else the people who have\nLived in the U.S in the past there was an article in the Washington Post focusing on these migrants some left voluntarily others were deported and I hear some of them are actually coming back to the U.S have you met any form us residents among the migrant yeah talking with on the right and as Martin\nI did I talked to three different

the economy in Mexico city wrote about ... he bought a remarkable advocate for women's soccer in Mexico mysteriously and brutally murdered Nina thank you very much for telling us about might have a a problem thank ...\n\nIt's been three weeks we're still trying to unravel the mystery of Saudi journalist ... disappearance and suspected murder but Saudi Arabian authorities denied having anything to do with it now they admit ... died inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as a result of a fight\nFew are buying it all along President Trump is facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia if it did murder ... by the president had been reluctant to do that in part because he says American Jobs are at stake\nSix hundred thousand jobs maybe more than that and it would be very hurtful to this country if we said oh we're not going to sell his teeth\nSo how many Americans would lose their jobs if President Trump stopped selling weapons to the Saudis arms in security analyst William Hartung studies weapons sales at the center for international policy\nWe'd like you to crunch the numbers for as you've heard President Trump's figures he mentioned six hundred thousand jobs in that clip just a moment ago how many us defense jobs actually depend on Saudi Arabia\nWhile it's hard to know precisely but you know a year and a half ago the president said it was forty thousand jobs there hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed a deal since President Trump came into office so\nEven if they you know decided to get rid of some deals that made under Obama we'd be talking thousands or at most tens of thousands of jobs not six hundred thousand or even a million which he said or the other day as well you know in the economy with a hundred and thirty million people employed it's just a blip I mean obviously if you work in a particular factory\nOr things are built that are being solved the Saudis it's a different matter but it's for our economy as a whole it's certainly not much and certainly not a reason to arm of ...\nThe Saudis it's a different matter but it's for our economy as a whole it's certainly not much and certainly not a reason to arm of murderous regime that's not only kill the journalists but in his bombing thousands of people in Yemen\nThe president talks about Saudi contracts Boeing and raise the on you're saying that this contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals are currently signed in what had the Saudis paid for\nThere was some thing here in the Obama period where they offered sixty billion dollars worth of weapons all in a couple of packages so not all of us have gone through but at Fifteen fighter planes Apache attack helicopters those happened and those were worth tens of billions of dollars\nSome of that money is already slowed they've started delivering the fifteenth so the money is water under the bridge it's already been spent we're not going to see it again\nThat would be hard for them to interrupt a deal that's in mid flow because allegedly they need these systems so what's actually on the table that might change is the deal for a missile defense system called Thad which was introduced during the Trump period and then you have to agree on the details so in theory the size and say well you know this particular deal we're not going to go through with\nAnd is there any risk if Trump or to ... that in China or Russia would pick up any of the business\nSaudi Arabia's whole military has built on us in UK supplied weapons communications and maintenance and spare parts it would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us the big picture here how important is the defense industry like all the jobs from planning to production and how much of the U.S economy depends on defense goods and how much of that is reliant on Saudi Arabia\nWell everything the Pentagon spends accounts for about three and a half percent of our entire economy\nAnd not all that as weapons and then the Saudi peace has a tiny fraction of that less than a tenth of a percent I Would say so it's really for the national economy it's not really important at all it's marginal it's it's really important and very specific places where a particular bomb is built for a particular aircraft\nI mean it's hard to know why President Trump\nPlaces where a particular bomb is built around particular aircraft\nI mean it's hard to know why President Trump wheels out numbers that actually aren't totally accurate but if you had to guess why do you think he would be bringing those numbers way way up\nI think partly he likes to show himself in sort of a master dealmaker who's getting the best deal for the American people on the American worker and you can see that on his trade policy as well\nBut also I think he's trying to change the conversation away from the crimes of the Saudi regime because he wants to team up with them or in going after Iran\nWilliam Hart telling the director of the arms and security project at the center for international policy in Washington thanks very much for explaining this to us thank you [noise]\nThe day's top news headlines just a minute away this is the world\n[noise]\nAlaska Native people were told they had to send their kids to the new schools or risk having them taken away over time the population of this part of the coast concentrated on Sarah chap island\nSo this thing called development committed these people to a spot which turns out to be directly in harm's way\nWorse case scenario of course is a storm comes in it and forces them off that land um this\nYear that's Joel climate again at the Interior Department she set out to get federal agencies to help protect people and coastal Alaska from the threats of rapid climate change\nShows more off in other towns were already engaged in planning your own solutions but the sticking point was money moving a whole town is a complicated and expensive affair one federal study pick the costs\nIt's a complicated and expensive affair one federal study pay the cost of living ... a hundred and Seventy nine million dollars\nAnd ... doesn't have that kind of money they don't have any kind of money actually forty percent of people live below the poverty line many homes don't have running water but Congress was not supportive of helping them make the move many members weren't and still aren't willing to accept the human caused climate change is even real\nSo finding dollars was very difficult we did manage to get some grant money and some grant programs bone up but the boys just embarrassingly difficult to find those dollars within the federal government\nIn twenty sixteen right before leaving office President Obama signed an executive order protecting marine resources and the bearing sea and setting up a new structure for helping Arctic communities respond to climate change climate was optimistic that would finally bringing meaningful action for ...\nAnd he thought it would stand up under the new Trump Administration\nFrankly despite all the anti climate change rhetoric of these new folks ah I wasn't worried about climate change adaptation because ... you know you're\nYou're addressing issues that are very clear in front of you people are being directly impacted by climate change it's not a model it's not a theory it's fact and of course uh I was being very naive\nLess than four months into the new administration President Trump revoked Obama's executive order the project was dead\nIt was a clear shot across the bow that hey ah doesn't matter whether you're working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions or protecting people imperil anything that has a with climate change to it ah has to stop\nThen a few months later\nClimate change to it ah has to stop\nThen a few months later Clinton got reassigned to a totally unrelated job for which he had no qualifications and he wasn't alone\nWhen I found out that dozens more senior executives like me had been reassigned I realize that it was that I was part of a purge\nClimate found a lawyer and filed a whistle blower complaint which is still pending he also wrote an op ed in the Washington Post and started speaking publicly about what's at stake not just his and his colleagues jobs but the people of many coastal Alaskans communities\nI mean government should be scrambling to try and find ways and dollars to get people out of harm's way and find innovative ways to do that it's what government does and that's what's appalling about this\nWhat would you say to people who are like um well it's your problem why should a state of Alaska or the federal government or anyone else help you if you need two hundred million dollars to move go find two hundred million dollars and good luck to you\nYeah well they'll they'll be saying the same thing to Miami pretty soon right so I mean what happens up there\nAh in the face of climate change is an important bellwether for what's going to happen in the rest of the coastal areas of the United states right I mean we're all American citizens and we have some expectation that we're not on her own right and and that's one of the things that makes this country great\n[noise]\nI reach out twice to the department of the interior for comment but they did not respond\n[noise]

don't the residents just go somewhere else no are fair banks or Seattle\nThat's a that's a cultural death to these communities each one of these villages is its own distinct culture their own distinct dialect to ask them to just assimilate into another village somewhere a is to ask them to let go their culture entirely which I think is\nHorrible [noise] everyone I met in ... seem to agree on this
