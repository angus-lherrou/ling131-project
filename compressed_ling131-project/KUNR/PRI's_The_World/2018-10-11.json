politicians use it\nPatrick ... reports on language for us so people in the right Patrick of long attack their opponents for being socialists what's different than how Trump use the word today\nWas

well it's just been a Soviet spy like socialism was a political third\nRight you're right I mean even the way Trump used the word today kind of has its genetics and the red scare and the Nineteen fifties in the McCarthy witch hunt so what kind of support the socialism or democratic socialism if they call it that what kind of support as it happened to us right now well\nI think we'll get some clues from the results in the midterms\nBut through other indications too I mean for one thing you have people on the right attacking socialism formal frequently than they used to leave the idea of socialism has become very popular among young people like Ben Shapiro who's a relatively young conservative commentator he was barely alive when the Berlin Wall came down\nAnd they frame socialism as you know the opposite of capitalism\nCapitalism is good because capitalism is freedom socialism his dad 'cause socialism is charity not going to ask for the journey socialism itself is hearing\nAlso
