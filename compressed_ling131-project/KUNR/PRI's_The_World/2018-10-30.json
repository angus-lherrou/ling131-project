name became well known here in the west after he was targeted by the Chinese government for his activism before that he was working in relative obscurity in Beijing in the mid nineties and for some years in New York City I look back on those years now as an important season in his life\nIf you talk about the winter then you come to spring here come pool summer morning to more pressures of time\nHis new book capture some of those times it's called I way way Beijing photographs Nineteen Ninety three to two thousand three and several photos he documents the final days of his father I Ching what a China is fine as modern poets and an artist who like his son felt the wrath of Chinese authorities after he\nPassed away I feel you feel you're alone and they don't belong to anybody and uh\nAnd maybe that's the moment you want to act so that's really a psychologically ... parish and for me to become a new boss for myself a new boss of yourself yes this is like the godfather feel\nSo I'd like you if you would tell us the story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because\nThe story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because the Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that defense should really unfold right\nYes is this the companies to society Irish and have a clear\nHierarchy you know so he was a kick out from a Communist Party\nAnd even he wants the same generation is a state leaders chairman mall drawing the line of people\nThat were took either but uh but he was heavily criticized author writes has in some way against the party so your father was in that inner circle with Mao oh yeah yeah they're really core which is support to sort of ... or ...\nBundle eight of course have being kicked out or from a party has untied revolution and uh spend about ... years so yeah I ... well not just allowed to ride towards his name's totally disappeared in the public\nIt was a memorial how did that memorial first they decided to his body has to be covered by communist flack\nIs very high on there and that means you're a part of it is a revolution but I feel ... uncomfortable you know I said you know you should not do something to somebody already passed away which you know his may against his will\nSo I made that argument that says we don't need to cover his out a flag\nDid they resist ... yeah they they told me they said you'll find that doesn't belong to a family you know which is very good argument and they say are we sending arms to the Communist Party or state was it a convincing argument though no it's not his\nThe Communist Party or state was it a convincing argument though no it's not it's a ... is ... to some mind no one has suffered so much that they took being covered by that piece of red button kit\nWith this Hummer and a hundred and cause that sickle said cool yeah I'm All right\nIf it's brutal [noise] hurts me and then there were the flowers flowers in this kind of ceremony the I'll use the same set of a paper flowers you know\nIf someone you spend the next day is a week later somebody dies the oh yeah yeah yeah same I I Will walk in the room I feel no no no we don't need to use an isn't being used before\nSo they say why they're going to do I set out will buy fresh flowers my father's poet has artists and he he life us so much relate to the highest static judgment on a moral judgment\nSo I said I have to change it so they send out a A R people the bald owns I'll Fight forest in Beijing city well I Know they made a fresh for bad so he can sleep or in the middle but still covered by this red blanket\nWhile your father was ill you did this performance I that's all I can call it a you intentionally smashed teaching dynasty porcelain and a ... dynasty earn and you were photographed smashing another are and how did these ideas come to you especially well your father was was dying\nJust not really much ideas is really attitude or some kind of a stupid ridiculous uh action you see ... and all that\nWait a ridiculous uh action is the child to that kind of ... and all the time was your intention to shake up the Chinese public know was not possible you'll have no path for the rest of society is in the sleep they don't care\nIt was interesting something you said about smashing the vows you felt it was almost like a child acting out and I want to ask you about the middle finger because it's a photographic motif that you've used pointing your finger\nAt the Hong Kong's skyline appointing middle finger at the Eiffel Tower Chairman Mao I felt like when I saw this it's like a rebellious teenager has just gotten a camera for the first time what is up with the finger is\nJust so sad to serve your ... now I realize that don't do that anymore because I'm Me grow older you know and the U.S individual in this society what else do I mean it's just ... opinions\nSo you spent a lot of time in the United states do you feel you can still count on the U.S to be kind of the beacon of free expression around the world\nI don't really sinks outweigh you know we on the surface things on the shallow surveys yes us are defending individual rights are human rights\nBut deeply us also costs and a lot of problem for other people from other nations for broader human rights violations\nI mean I asked partly because you live in Berlin now but I understand you're moving to New York with your family right yes so I Know you've described to us as a country of immigrants which I think a lot of people would agree with but president Donald Trump seems to reject that idea how do you feel about this reality as wherever they moved\nEnd of the reality is about how you as a nation still have power to accept the difference\nAs a nation still have power to accept the difference still have an edgy are\nStill young enough to pick the challenge and have a vision and a and a half of the big heart so if they don't then there will push people way they'll blame other people and the it just shows that we can is\nAnd if that big heart starts to shrink while you're here are you going to turn your eye and your critique toward the United states or at least make your critics in your art of China more universal and maybe I'm to the U. S.\nI always protect the basic rights of freedom of speech and a human rights I don't see that's the only as a Chinese problem is universal problem\nI weigh thank you very much for your time it was an honor and a great pleasure to meet you thank you nice to be here [noise] check out myself the with I way way and the really cool thing about it I wake took it because you know skill you can see it at the world dot O. R. G. [noise]\nNews\nHeadlines or an ax here on the world [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd all around the Arctic it's starting to fall you might have seen some of the pictures roads that are sinking in buckling homes shifting and cracking and trees tilting at awkward angles giving rise to the label drunken forests in fact there's a lot of telephone\nPoles next to the ... and I are standing in one of them looked a little drunk and to\nThat one that is kind of tilting now that is probably standing in an area where the permafrost is just disappearing\nKind of ... now that is probably standing in an area where the ... is just disappearing now so they will have to\nDo that so for people who live in the Arctic these changes are really big deal and many northern cultures sellers cut into the permafrost have been a reliable way to store food it becomes nature's freezer now people can't always trust that their food won't spoil\nAnd thawing permafrost affects all of the newer kinds of infrastructure to not only buildings water mains sewage dreams even cemeteries\nCommunities are scrambling to adapt to the ground literally shifts beneath them but ... says permit process important to all of us no matter where we live because it's providing a globally important service keeping carbon out of the atmosphere free of charge\nSo the permafrost that we have here was formed probably in the during the last ice age so like eleven thousand years or so ago\nThat material in the ... is that old like it is made up\nOut of material from finds that used to grow at that time\nAnd the remains of dead animals are in the soil to not fossilized Bones Are petrified wood to actual stuff\nAnd all of this organic material has a lot of carbon in it in fact that's what the word organic means organic chemistry is carbon chemistry so when gates has said this soil has a lot of dead plants in it she means we put our carbon in the freezer\nWe have and now we're unfortunately kind of taking the plug out of the freezer and the stars and she's sauce and so then one from a frost it starts to truly thought than than carbon just kind of comes like how does the carbon get from down there\nThan than carbon just kind of comes like how does the carbon get from down there to up into the atmosphere um because my parents are eating it and they are aspiring so they are breathing basically and then they emit carbon\nSo it's micro breath that we have to worry about [laughter]\nBasically [laughter] microbes when living things die microbes begin breaking them down in the carbon that was locked up in a blade of grass or the horn upper basin gets liberated and floats up into the atmosphere as methane or carbon dioxide\nFreezing slows microbes down but it doesn't kill them stalling speeds them back up\n\nBack at the lake Matilda rose up close to a big funnel floating upside down in the water that has a big syringe fitted onto the skinny and sticking out these little contraptions look pretty homemade because they are\nThe way we make them flowed disposable using the noodles things from using swimming pool\n[laughter] [noise] so\nYou take your phone will turn it upside down rather piece of pool noodles around the wide part and put a plastic syringe on the top and you've got yourself a little trap designed to capture gases and bubbling up from the lake below Matilda rose us up to another trial and your team reaches over the side of the boat with a syringe and his hand\nSo he's pulling out the gas [noise]\nWhen did you find\nSome middle leaders of gosh they're just used to be losing the look so much a word from the from the global travel through the water and Georgia notes rooms are\nThey likely captured a mixture of gases\nMost of which are well look at them\n... says most of which will look at them but we're not sure so we take these to laugh and then we measure the actual nothing comes Russian\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas and these scientists have forty or these bubble traps on this lake and a bunch more nearby\nThey check all of them multiple times a week all summer long\nAnd this is all just to understand how much methane is coming off this one small area this year under these particular condition groups of scientists are at work around the Arctic studying sites that are wetter or dryer colder or warmers with more or less vegetation\nAnd they're all trying to understand just how quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nI think the the scary part that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon in the store here in the form of ... we're trying to actively to figure that out [noise]\nYour team says it's hard to accurately assess greenhouse emissions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex\nBut it's also hard because humans have never warned the planet up like we are now we have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective we're in what climate scientists call a new analog situation a massive global experiment\nThere's not that we turn on the big Arctic permafrost machine or we don't know what it does [noise] um and until we actually figure out what it does maybe you could do to stop turning up [noise] [noise]\nYou have a warming of one degree that makes all the difference in the world because it gets from frozen to thought and that is something\nScientists are really worried about because there are many ah thresholds if you might cross there\n... very says that in many parts of the Arctic the permafrost has already thought enough to start emitting carbon in other places the frozen soil is right on the cusp of that to the point where a change of one or two degrees can transform it from being something that stores carbon to something that ... that\nWe might tip the scales of these really large exchanges then it can have really traumatic consequences [noise]\nIt's not about saving the polar bear I think a lot of people when they think about how much it you know ... it's cute but but it's also about like us surviving as a species because if it gets much warmer\nLike the way that we have evolved with our agriculture and how we think the food we eat and where we live is just not adapted to [noise]\nWe don't know how close we are to a massive release of carbon from frozen Arctic soils but we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point\nScientists call it a positive feedback loop more carbon in the air leads to more warming which leads to the release of more carbon in the process just builds on itself [noise]\nAnother thing we know is that we don't get a second chance at this once our emissions potentially trigger this huge release of carbon we've put ourselves at the mercy of processes that we can't control and that will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and her own civilizations\n[noise] I ask your team if he thought there was any way to stop this experiment where conduct\n... thought there was any way to stop this experiment for conducting on the Arctic or if he thought the damage was already done and now we just have to ride it out [noise]\nNow we have an ability to stop [noise] of course we do we have choices and [noise] I think especially in the western world in which will we have choices and therefore we have responsibility [noise] um [noise]\nAnd one of the ways is to try and understand this experiment better and that's my part that's what we do here and the other part is acting on what we already know which is [noise]
