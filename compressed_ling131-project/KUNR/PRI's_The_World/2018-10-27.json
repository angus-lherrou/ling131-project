not\nOthers used the term extreme is for men who openly disparage gays and blacks and insulted women but when pressed for past remarks is presented to these both in our supporters some respond with a familiar refrain\nFake news is a ... it's just no\nTrue ... yeah I think it may lie about him that's all media they're just trying to not to get him elected which is not going\nBrazilians around the world can vote back home as long as they were born in Brazil regardless of immigration status where they live most Brazilians of Massachusetts confirm to relatively politically conservative areas in

roads exploiting resentment over Brazilian government programs for the poor and that appeals to me\nExploiting resentment over Brazilian government programs for the poor that appeals to many Brazilian immigrants here in the U.S because they see themselves as self made\nMany immigrants working very hard to make a living\nThing that having a government that's very much in favor of the giving help to the the poor people in this kind of think it's a waste they would vote for a minimum government this kind of ideology is very widespread among received a new immigrants in the U.S [noise]\nThey are the ... of the poor in Brazil\nNuts Alisa Tracy is executive director of the Brazilian worker center in Boston where some of her clients phrase possible deportation by the Trump Administration but

may and then they turn around and they say was ... when I say what's the difference between\nThe Trump and oh it's very different and I says well what about racism and discrimination and promoting violence I mean I don't understand why people are not able to see that the the two people are very similar and the message and the ideology\nTracy supports workers' party candidate for under what does

ordinary guy for the world full of mark Boston\nVoter turnout is key in any election some places like Brazil have mandatory voting laws here in the U.S ahead of the midterms their concern in some states about efforts to suppress voting North Dakota for example that's where the stand and vote campaign comes in it seeks to encourage turnout and voter registration among Native Americans\nActor mark ... is part of the stand and vote campaign mark you were part of the protests and sit ins that went on in North Dakota against the Dakota access pipeline which has since been constructed what kind of you involved in that campaign\nThese water issues as they pertain to fossil fuel extraction was hoping that I already been working on for years many of the people that I worked with uh in in New York or native people and when Standing Rock was happening or I was invited to to come and stand if my native brothers and sisters to protect our water\nSo now you've given it a bit I'm Still working with with ah natives and getting out the vote I Know standing voting is campaign geared toward native populations in the U.S and in a a big part of it it has to do with the Supreme Court upholding this North Dakota vote voter id law what does that last say\n... basically says that ah unless you have a a street address on your id in North Dakota you aren't allowed to vote\nMost of the people who live on reservations\nDakota you aren't a lot of most of the people who live on reservations don't\nActually have a a a physical street address use PO box is\nSo now that the Supreme Court has upheld that law one can people on reservations in North Dakota do are coming up on midterms say\nYou know they can they can give them a general St ... a street address 'em through the uh the NATO council through the tribal council in each reservation\nI'm just curious if you're an actor and I I just wondered you call on different strengths their talents or in your activism than than in your acting career\nThis is a function at our artists have historically performs\nBring light to uh those issues that are that are in the dark and\nUm whether you're doing it on stage or with ideas play right you're doing it a movie with um with the struggles of human beings and storytelling or you're doing it directly indirect action um like standing at Standing Rock occupy\nWall Street or getting involved with a campaign or the fight against the war in Yemen\nUm these are part of the functions of being an artist and a something that I I put a lot of good faith in\nMark ... is an actor an activist he's involved with the stand and vote campaign an effort to get the vote out among Native Americans in North Dakota thank you so much mark thank you so have you talk to you [noise]\nThe day's top news stories are minute away you're with the world\n[noise]\nWays that seems to have gotten a bit last year you know as soon as being more reported on as you well you know this is just another son the Trump doesn't do what he's doing that he's reckless that he's\nAs you well you know this is just another son that Trump doesn't do what he's doing that he's reckless that he's endangering the security of everybody and hasn't generated nearly as much heat and save the letter bomb story which is\nThe reaction that Christopher described in Greece is exactly the same reaction that's happened here without saying that Trump has brought this on himself he's ratcheted up the tension\nUm that's generating a lot more passionate about what each than the thought that someone's a hack Donald Trump's I thought\nOh I Can't have a journalist from Germany ... from Greece in an interview without asking you both you know your two countries have had some tensions in recent years you know over a ... and that kind of thing I mean Howard Harry your country is getting along these days [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I I think\nIt's a love affair slowly slowly let's start from our prime minister Mr chipper us\nWho um was elected in two thousand and scream\nWith tens of thousands of people gathering in the center of other ones on the repeating off him his very famous China McDonalds America to go home he hate to an end at the beginning this kind of relation\nBetween ... onto the cheaper ah was always at the core of our attention as journalists how is he\nPossibly going to confront too when you first meet in the European Union I'm gradually we we love that ... quite special relationship between them and it was not a closer look there by any\nMeans but it was certainly a kind of a mother\nTowards the child is a she seems to kind of educate them in the way it listen let's talk peacefully come here come to this room to sit by ourselves sometimes alleged tool it we know that he respects\nHere come to this room to sit by ourselves sometimes alleged tool it we know that he respects are very very much the situation the relationship between the two countries I think is I'm\nQuite good Jefferson how does it feel in Berlin yeah\nI I Would pretty much agree with that I mean I think I'm Greece's lot smaller than Germany so it doesn't commands or tension here probably as much as we command there tend to live but I think the sense is that you know the Greeks has\nDone a pretty good job of trying to get their economic problems on to control they basically done what's the Germans have asked them and that they should be given a break and of course\nYou don't ... medical has much bigger problems with some other European leaders you know main competitor like Victor all bond in Hungary you know I'm a going out for a meal with the prime minister of Greece is probably a walk in the park\nIf I may just add another fact that I'm sure the address and lose about that as well we we lost from a German uh my my favorite football team or just lost one by an ... days ago and I'm going to have you been\nBoth [laughter] I tap awfully on that up our\nTeam cost eight

with us today I'm happy to know\n\nOur next story is about a part of immigrant life in the U.S at sometimes goes unnoticed is the fact that immigrant workers are more educated than ever before\nThey're just as likely to hold a bachelor's degree as us citizens but often that education doesn't cross over which prevents people from continuing the careers they had back home are part of Ashley clique noticed this imbalance in the nurse\nEven the careers they had back home reporter Ashley clique noticed this imbalance in the nursing world where there is a labor shortage which she also found programs trying to bridge the gap\n... was working as a nurse in Haiti when the massive earthquake struck in twenty ten she rushed to care for women she delivers babies\nI took care of people with HIV to murder which they try to be taking care of their babies to\nDefine had found her calling but in twenty sixteen she moved to New York to be with her husband she left her country and her
