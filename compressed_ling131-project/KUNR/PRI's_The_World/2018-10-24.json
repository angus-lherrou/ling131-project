U. N. R. dot org [noise]\nI'm Mark a woman and misses the world\nIt is a huge number of people are walking together five to seven thousand migrants across the board of this week from Guatemala into southern Mexico\nFrom here in the U. S. it's become a political issue ahead of the midterms President Trump strikes they conspiratorial tone when he says hardened criminals and middle Easterners are heading toward the U.S those claims have no evidence by the way\nThe Mexican government is handling the situation as a humanitarian one Danielle beyond is a former spokesman in President Enrique opinion yet the government he's now a political consultant\nBeyond says Mexico's government is currently walking a tightrope\nOn the one hand you have your ally and your biggest partner putting pressure on you and also recall and I think the fact that you need to protect your own borders on your your only about ...\nYou're on ... and also recall and I think the fact\nThat you need to protect your own borders on you're you're only allowed but on the other hand there's like the whole movement in the public opinion on Mexico saying hey guys we should treat the Central Americans as we require the American roots are Mike Rounds up on the north\n[noise] what about right now we're seeing Mexican police in riot gear some of them look like they're ready to go to battle what rights do the Mexican immigration laws give the migrants right now we're traveling through the country\nLooked for decades Mexican southern border has to be very ... meaning that we have like four years hundreds of thousands of immigrants\nFrom South and Central America traveling through Mexico we have heavily invested is a country and our southern border to provide more facilities for legal crossing and to provide humanitarian be set for those probably to the north\nAnd yet Mexican police fired tear gas at some of the migrants enclosed aboard or did you see that as a serious effort or just ...\nWhat I see that Mexican police work or not they were having the shells and and the guy says but they were not carrying guns because that was the ... they said like they didn't want casualties from these clashes\nSo the Mexican police had no live ammunition could Mexican police and security stop the migrants if they wanted to could they forced them back south\nThey could do that my guess is that they Mexican authorities do will try to negotiate with them in order for them to apply for humanitarian beside us\nDaniel how do you think most Mexicans view the Central Americans passing through Mexico right now are are they welcoming them would they accept them if they were just stay\nOn the one hand you'll see that a lot of people that go among the poor even like working class people try to have that immigrants provide\nThat a lot of people like come on people even like working class people trying to get up to immigrants providing them with\nFood shed their what their we could be not do their own country for decades we were the country that receive so many Europe yes particularly Spaniards fleeing from CBS wires and World War two but you'll still see some sectors in Mexican society saying these\nPeople are coming to steal our jobs for Mexico is not so easy just to ignore or scrap the U.S\nPoints of view in this issue we\nAre countries that are heavily dependent upon each other Fifteen hundred billion dollars per year trade but on the other hand Mexican public opinion they are not happy with the fact of the government just taking orders from another government Mm So the Mexican federal taking\nOrders from the White House in Washington is certainly Danielle beyond is a political consultant in Mexico city he's also a former spokesman in the government of president Enrique Pena Nieto\nDanielle thank you for your time happy to talk to you Michael\nYesterday President Trump announced that he would make cuts in U.S foreign aid for three Central American countries Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador they've been receiving the said since twenty sixteen and it's expected to go down by nearly forty percent and twenty Nineteen that means cutting tens of millions of dollars in financial assistance to the region\nWe wanted to know what that eight actually goes to Sarah\nPeers is with the migration Policy Institute in Washington\nSo what has this aid been used for what what was it earmarked for and how was it used\nTo use wide variety of issues I mean one of the biggest issues when you're talking specifically about the night and change our country and the alliance for posterity these days\nThe lines for prosperity this is a program that arose out of a separate migration crisis that we had in two thousand fourteen when a lot of company in child migrants arrived at our southern border\nPresident Obama at that time and knowledge that in order to really address migration you need to go to the root cause and and look at what's going on in these home countries to cause people to to fleeing and really have this mass exodus\nThe alliance for prosperity is designed to increase economic prosperity in those countries and strengthen institutions because there's a lot of issues with corruption so that's one of our our major programs going into these countries and and one of the programs that the president you know in reality is threatening to the end\nSo regardless of how much eventually get stripped out of the budget line for a Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador ... the Trump Administration or any other administration without approval of Congress to slash an aid package to a country\nLooking at the law as it might be possible that he has the ability to transfer maybe ten percent of what has been appropriated but no he cannot do that unilaterally and of course because Congress isn't in session now if he really wanted to to end it to these countries he'd really need to wait until they come back in session after November\n... or how political do see the movie being as it's only the Trump believes will play well with Republican voters prior to the midterms\nYeah absolutely President Trump ran on immigration he saw that issue when him the election and I think he thinks that it is a good one for Republicans going into the midterms\nThat it is a good one for Republicans going into the midterms so this caravan effectively as a political gift to him and Republicans in that they can play this up they can play themselves up as the party that is hard line on immigration and that will save the country quote unquote from this caravan\nTrump made this announcement yesterday have you heard any news from Honduras or El Salvador Guatemala ... about what could happen if as much as forty percent of the state gets caught\nI think the northern triangle countries in Mexico as well are are doing a good job of trying to\nWeed through what's coming out from the president and what's coming out in the press and and try to stick to what's actually happening on the ground they recognize that we had a very eminent election in the country and they're just trying to stick with what they think will will actually come so I haven't heard a lot of\nReal concern on the ground up around that aid\nAnd just because it seems so unlikely that that Congress would go through with a threat like that\nAnd what is your organization for migration Policy Institute planning in terms of strategy to to take this on anything\nFor us we're really looking at those reforms to asylum like I mentioned earlier we actually published a report last month\nAdvocating for certain reforms to the asylum system including changing asylum for individuals who are applying at our border like this care of and so that and it operates more efficiently because right now if if anyone in the care of and apply for asylum\nThey'll likely be placed in our immigration court backlog which stretches on for years\nImmigration court backlog which stretches on for years so waiting in the United states and the way down the line and immigration court judge will have to pick up their case and started from scratch and see if it's in sincere asylum application\nIn reality we'd like to see a a more efficient system operating at the southern border so where we're working really hard to to kind of push out that idea and and stress the importance of granting asylum to those who married at\n... policy analyst at the migration Policy Institute in Washington Thank you for your time thank you for having me\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nThere's
