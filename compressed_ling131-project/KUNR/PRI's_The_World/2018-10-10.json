year he said it's been an honor of a lifetime to serve at the un and she ticked off a list of foreign policy accomplishments under President Trump\nThe United states for trees may not like\nWe I think what we think that if we think we're going to do something we follow it through in the primary\nWe're going to do something we fall when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO than that other countries have to pay their share I mean whether to trade deals with your main thing they did the business and they saw us for that\nHaley was speaking there at the White House seated next to the President Trump spoke to praising Haley's diplomatic work at the un\nSo that was really the thing I think she did best at the United nations you got to know

earlier this year she's now a vice president with the global business strategy from Albright stone bridge group\nSo Mali we're still trying to figure out why ambassador Haley resigned today essentially she said it was time what do you make of the timing of this resignation why no\nWell the timing was somewhat of a surprise mecca but I Do think it's no secret that ambassador Haley's influence had been in decline\nSince John Bolton took on his role as national security advisor Nikki Haley as not someone who folds\nEasily I Would say and so the idea that\nIf I were a significantly diminished by their rival the secretary of ... and John Bolton that she would depart I think is is a logical next step\nYeah I mean tell me more about the arrival of John Bolton Trump's national

got strong views of the UN to boot how well did he ... he would get along\nMy understanding is that he certainly exerted more as an influence\nIs a former U.S ambassador to the United nations and so this has somewhat of a pet issue for him and during his tenure he was famous or rather perhaps infamous for his dislike of the un and his skepticism of multilateral is more generally\nYou said her quote had been on the decline can you elaborate a little bit more on that\nDuring the early months of the Trump Administration Nikki Haley was really willing to push U.S policy in areas particularly concerning in Russia\nAnd Ukraine from her perch at the un\nAnd she was able to do that because there was a vacuum as Tillerson declined to engage with both allies and adversaries alike and so as secretary Pompeo moved over from\nThe CIA he has been much more willing to fill that traditional roles and I think that engagement has really close to the space for Nikki Haley to operate beyond just the un\nNikki Haley was pretty tough when it came to Russia wasn't sure she\nWas absolutely particularly I Would say in the early months of the administration there were several instances when she pushed the envelope in terms of the administration's rhetoric on Russia particularly speaking about Russian aggression toward Ukraine and settling down some markers for the administration on that issue\nComing up hotel workers joined me to return to the world [noise]\n[noise]\nGood evening this is key when our eighty eight point seven [noise]\nWe get support from the Reno chamber

hotel industry achieve the goal they'd been fighting for for a long time getting their employers to do more to protect them from sexual assault\nWas made headlines a few years back when a hotel housekeeper accused Dominique Strauss Kahn the former head of the IMF of sexual assault that case was settled out of court but the problem never went away here's the world's Alison at at a\nImagined is you're a woman working in an office and you're in the middle of the meeting all of a sudden your meal coworker starts to address it's hard to imagine that happening right well if you're a hotel housekeeper chances are it has happened to you\nYou know I'm not three times and I'm assuming oh no one's in the room so I'm going to put my key and I'm going into the room so this particular time you know I'm not answer this moment is gas is standing there completely ...\nThat's ... she's a housekeeper at a large hotel in Chicago she asked me not to use her last name or the name of the hotel where she works she's worried about how speaking out my impact her job she says that when this happened she was more than just scared\nLike it just it made me feel disgusted angry so I just kinda like bad or just left\nShe recorded a tour manager but she says nothing was done\nSo it's one of those things happen so much and housekeeping where your managers kinda feel like it was just normal and they just say okay you don't go back to the ground today\nAnd they just say okay you don't go back to their own today\nBut she did have to go back she brought another woman so she wouldn't have to be alone and fortunately that guest wasn't there but he wasn't asked to leave\nSo twenty sixteen when members of her union UNITE HERE wanted to ask her and her co workers some questions about sexual assaults on the job she knew this was her chance to make change happen\nI'm like oh okay and one of my coworkers within the next ... and she's like you know just kind of knows me like you know they come and talking about sexual harassment and I'm I'm like this is our opportunity to kind of share things that we deal with every day\nWith Tony and other housekeepers and the union set up to survey more than five hundred women about their experiences on the job nearly sixty percent of women they talked with dealt with some form of assault by hotel guest\nThat lead to action last year housekeepers in Chicago successfully lobbied for device to keep them safe it's called the panic button and it was part of a city wide campaign known as hands off pants on so this is one solution\n[noise] it's it's send a message that I was in danger in that room\nAlready for her age she's the head of housekeeping at the ... hotel she shows me how the safety device works press the button and hotel security is on the way [noise]\nHoge emigrated here from the nineties from what was then Yugoslavia she's always worked as a housekeeper her story is not uncommon according to a study done by the ...\nHer story is not uncommon according to a study done by the American immigration council the top occupation for foreign born women here in the U.S is housekeeping\nWas nearly nine hundred thousand women working in this sector\nFor judge having the panic button has made her and her staff safe I honestly think since the great think\nIt is great for Chicago hotels are required to give this device to housekeepers but sexual assault in the hotel industry it's a global issue so what are some of these larger chains like Mary auto tuned to keep their workers safe say in Paris or ... by\nSuch heightened awareness around safety and security so we're dialing up in the space but I think it's important to remember there is no one magic answer\nThat's Erica Alexander she's the chief lodging services officer from Marriott International she's talking about the new devices the rolling out in the U.S and Canada but the company has no current plans to put panic buttons into the hands of their workers in other countries\nThat for us it's a huge problem because we understand that you know the Mariette brand should be doing the right thing whether they're here in the United states around the world\nThat can be fined gold she's the international director of the AFL CIO she says that back in June housekeepers\nFrom Chicago presented at an international labor conference in Geneva they inspired other housekeepers working in South Africa and around the globe to push for hands off pants on campaign\nIf there is a practice here in the United states and Mary I can do it here in the United states they can do it in China where they had math and a ... fashion they can do it throughout Asia throughout Latin America\nBefore the me too movement last year housekeepers like with Tony I didn't have much of a voice when it came to safety um\nKeepers like with Tony I didn't have much of a voice when it came to safety on the job they've been trying for years to get their employers to protect them\nAnd then all of a sudden all of this stuff started showing up in the news and I'm just like this is incredible on my book could do like we we have all had the same family like we've started something\nAnd they have five of the major hotel chains have promised to install panic buttons in all their hotels nationwide by twenty twenty but for so many people around the globe or things housekeepers there's no button that can press to stop them from being assaulted on the job\nFor the world Alison had I had a Chicago [noise]\nPay enough already with the phone scams you know a stranger asking you for your
