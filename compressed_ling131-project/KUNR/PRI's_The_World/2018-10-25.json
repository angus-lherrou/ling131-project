was broadcaster made possible by generous grant from the EL court foundation\nIn memory of EL court pioneer radio broadcaster\n\n\nMm\nI'm Mark a worm and this is the world lately things have been pretty tense between the U.S and China and not just over trade and tariffs earlier this month and a major speech vice president Mike Pence took aim at China's leaders\nThere contesting America's geopolitical advantages and trying in essence to change the international order in their favor under President Trump's leadership the United states has taken decisive action to respond to China with American action\nOther areas of friction include the south China Sea Taiwan human rights intellectual property not to mention President Trump accusing China of meddling in the mid term election campaign David Rennie writes the sugar one column and the economy is so big question David here is this a new Cold War with China\nDoesn't have to be on China is extremely keen but it should not be they don't even want to trade will and they are pretty desperate to avoid one end to work out what America wants bought it used to be just a few hard line is here in Beijing who saw that America\nAmerica wants bought it used to be just a few hardliners here in Beijing who saw that America actually\nCouldn't be negotiated with the America wanted to contain China and still China's rise that fringe\nOf hardliners is now spreading an awful lot of Chinese leaders look at the speech by vice president Mike Pence attacking China for a a kind of laundry list of complaints they look at how Donald Trump isn't really engaging\nWhen it comes to winding down this potential trade ... and they're starting to wonder whether there was fear\nMight actually be what's happening to them which is that just as they were poised to become a kind of great superpower or the top of the sudden economic totem pole America in its last kind of\nDying vengeance is a kind of aging heck I'm On has decided to try and stop them and so that is the that is the question that Beijing leaders ... and they absolutely will not looking for this fight right now that busy trying to become rich and powerful and this has come out of out of the blew up and\nWell the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP that was supposed to give us some leverage with some of the dishes like intellectual property rights but Trump pulled out of it\nA try I mean those are those ... a retired very senior American officials in Beijing last week and it was all off the record so I Can't name but he was a kind of household name in this day and he comes to ... for business or an stokes the Chinese they take advice from him\nAnd he had a small dinner for a group of us in Beijing we're discussing what Trump wants on you know I was discussing having into the Trump the times about China went understood in\nDC I kind of put it to him and he was kind of uncomfortable but then said that maybe there's something to this the\nThe problem is that the machine in Washington has kind of systematic structural things but it wants China to do differently to play by the rules to try and fix the world trade older as you say Marco to you know to what was something like the ... everyone opens their markets that will do don't\nAs you say mark ... to you know to what was something like the ... everyone opens their markets that will Donald Trump I don't think is a systems kind of guy I think he has a number of very powerful very instinctive ideas and I think\nIf you look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if you know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate and that\nPrevious presidents in America's administrations were too dumb and to kind of kindly to charge enough rent to the rest of the world for access to that market and so it's like you know don't Trump's back in his real estate days he's he he he owns a valuable property this time it's called the United states\nAnd it's time to review the rent and it's not going to be pleasant for the guy on the other side of the table\nBut there isn't gonna biggest structural kind of vision of how to run the world trading older it's just it's time you pay the low will rent I I think that's the quote unquote on Trump is up to right now\nWhat is China's vision for the world\nSo he's a really interesting saying the Chinese joined the world Trade Organization Seventeen years ago and have basically been gaming the system ever since uh China\nChina is very interesting world power because China has an incredibly clear vision of where it wants to end up it has a very clear and gold and you know probably that's to be one of the world's most powerful to countries and so powerful that no one else gets to say no to them\nDoes to go how they get that\nIs not actually so important that quite opportunistic if one policy ... they'll try another\nIf there's too much pushback then there'll be nice for but that's very very kind of cross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of fries and and\nFor a long time they were game of the world trading system and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months to brew trade tensions and you get this when you talk to the European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing\nShe wants to build trade tensions and you get this when he talked to a European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing it turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike\nMore than an American led worlds trading older is no rules a tool and so suddenly the Chinese have be undermined the rules gave me the rules playing the system so then they realized that the one thing they don't want to do is to lose the system completely so suddenly the Chinese are\nQuite in the winter of reforming the WTO no longer kind of cheating so much so the result is kind of\nThose who these moving costs where you could actually see something quite positive ... the problem is\nThat you can also see some very negative kind of forces that could feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction\nOr an absolutely confident Chinese don't actually know how to play this and I noticed that because\nReasonably senior Chinese officials are now working their way down to list the people who can explain what comes to them they got so low down the list they are also people like me and I literally have conversations with what I say I'm a reporter it's not my job to tell you you know how to handle the Americans but they're all skiing everyone is this trade war avoidable\nGraham Allison over at Harvard coined the phrase a few cities trap tell us what that is and how the Chinese said so she said that this was an ancient\nGreek historian who wrote about when you had a very militaristic rising power sponsor coming up against the status quo ... Athens it ended up inevitably the war and so he's been analyzed a number of occasions I have a human history where the status quo power finds itself being challenged by an upstart\nAnd in a depressing number of cases that does trigger armed conflict I mean you could be an optimist in say the Chinese are busy trying to get rich\nThat trying to become more powerful they are absolutely not looking to solve the Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time even for trade will that lead in a shooting war so they're just not going to stall sentencing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is the protests\nPortrayed will let alone a shooting war so they're just not gonna stop sentencing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of the funds from Vietnam I think he's not physically a kind of war like person he's that kind of ... soft handed kind of New York real estate guy\nUm so I think as people age to go to war but the dynamics can get a bit away from you when you've got these two big big countries that no longer think that they are\nConfined win win solutions you know this does feel weird leaves zero some now it feels as though the American charges that China's rise is at America's expense\nAnd that this is a kind of wouldn't before trying to get so big\nThat it's too late to stop it it's it's a window to try and ... there was this extraordinary things on the Trump said I think it was the U.N General assembly speech when he said the previous presidents have\nBeen ready to watch China rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch that wasn't going to happen quite say see that's really extraordinary statement in a previous American presidents said you know if you're going to rise let's make sure you rise\nIn the right way you're going to rise as a responsible stakeholder remember that phrase that people used to use about China that it was going to become a kind of a member of the grace and the good a pope the international older along with everyone else but for Donald Trump to say at least as a piece of rhetoric\nYou're just not going to grow rice and the way that you thought you were going to I'm going to stop it\nThat that is an incredibly bleak thing for Beijing to hit\nDavid Rennie of the economist speaking with us from Beijing thank you pleasure [noise] news headlines are coming up and about sixty seconds this is the world and the world dot O.

I don't want to suggest that Brazil is different from any other place in the world but I mean is there a kind of a cultural thing here with the contagion of these these fake news stories\nYes we have um a social and economic component that need to be taken into account when you talk about fake news and what what are those cars I think we have a huge inequality in poor people are left behind in in

former president ... yeah I'm a native ... made people believing in and they don't believe in these tuitions anymore neither the government or the newspapers\nOr and I know there is no easy solutions that they would believe right now and and this is also very important when you study fake news because people tend to believe in the misinformation contains instead of believing in the institutions or
