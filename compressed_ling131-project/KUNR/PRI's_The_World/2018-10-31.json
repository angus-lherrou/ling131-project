S. a record low cap under President Trump to making the lives of migrants coming to this country miserable now Trump says he plans to eliminate birth\nCome into this country miserable now Trump says he plans to eliminate birthright citizenship that's the idea that if you were born in the U. S. you're automatically a citizen it's not clear if he can do that the concept is enshrined in an amendment to the U.S constitution for the president told actually as he could do away with it unilaterally\nYou can definitely do with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do and just with an executive order\nMartha Jones is a professor at Johns Hopkins university and the author of birthright citizens a history of race and rights so this is all tied into the fourteenth amendment and there was an interesting history behind that could could you talk about what went into forming it\nSure the fourteenth amendment comes into being in the aftermath of the U.S civil war for a million plus former slaves are now free people and the question is who will they be in a formal constitutional sense with respect to the nation\nThe fourteenth amendment declares them to be birthright citizens but it goes further of course because it extends beyond former slaves to all persons born in the United states making them citizens at the United states\nSo let's talk about that a more in a moment I'm up because it's all part of of your research let's just get into the president's for what we're looking at today or a prior case that came close to defining or interpreting this from the Supreme Court\nMost important case for thinking about this question is\nThat of a gentleman named Juan Kim arc um it's decided by the Supreme Court an Eighteen Ninety eight one Kim ark is born in the United states um his parents are Chinese immigrants\nWho cannot become citizens of the United states because of the existing Chinese exclusion acts at the period but one himself students in South to be a citizen because he was born in the United states he leaves states\nBut long himself assumes himself to be a citizen because he was born in the United states he leaves states to do business in China\nAnd when he returns he's detained at the port and refused re entry his case goes to the U.S Supreme Court\nWhere the court affirms that even as long Kim arts parents cannot become citizens of the United states he because he was born in the U.S pursuant to the fourteenth amendment is a citizen\nSo it seems like which is kind of centered on the parents to do the outcome at the Supreme Court essentially defined birthright citizenship as we know today\nWell it did it in the important sense that um it rejected the view that one's citizenship turned on the citizenship status of one's parents\nUm and so as a President Trump now I'm appears to be aiming for um those born in the U.S whose parents are not citizens Wong Kim ark is an important touchstone\nI'm just wondering what's to stop the government's revoking anybody citizenship I mean should that war is\nWhat we know is that in our system ultimately it is going to be um some combination of the Supreme Court which will decide the constitutional questions related to send us an Shepard will determine in the end\nWe have rivers and always full interview with ... for the way as a world dot O.

budget thank you [noise] uh what is the place of Facebook in the lives of most Filipinos like how much of the population has access to it and how much did they interact with each other by the up while it's remarkable the story Facebook\nAnd Southeast Asia is amazing that they pushed aggressively into south east Asia and to Philippines and demand more other countries\nAnd they are essentially the de facto Internet and a lot of those countries because they offer Facebook as part of a data plan where people don't actually have to\nUse the data in order to use it in the Philippines it's between Ninety and a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and Maria wrestler who who's uh\nThe Internet basically and Maria wrestler who who's a woman were interviewing in the film from the Philippines who runs the big news organization there she talks about the fact that it's their public space it truly is their public space in the Philippines um in terms of that their digital lives\nSo Maria wrestle we just heard from her more from her in a moment um we've reported on the store that uh occurred in Myanmar where fake news actually lead to violence headed Rodrigo Duterte day the Filipino president weaponize Facebook during the election campaign and twenty sixteen\nSo what happened is Facebook actually offered a lot of help to deter today during his campaign for president and helped him to really harness the power of the platforms helped his campaign really understand how to use it effectively and as Maria wrestle reports\nAfter he was elected he essentially weaponized it by turning all this campaign machinery all these accounts that he was controlling he had\nA network of fake accounts and paid followers that were just sending all sorts of lives about his policies and uh also going after critics in a rather vicious hateful way um and in some cases are trying to incite violence against people\nSo on Maria Russia or the this activist and she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook's attention in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dock here's an exchange between you James and Maria Reza\nWere you given an explanation as to why they weren't acting [noise]\nI think baseball one day and they were focused on what they didn't realize is that country\nAnd they were focused on growth but they didn't realize is that countries like the [noise] countries way institutions are clear corruption is rampant these countries don't have the safeguards\nWhen you bring everyone onto a platform and do not exercise any kind of rules\nIf you don't implement those rules for ... in the chaos says\nJames what did Facebook tell you about the way they responded to the Philippines and to Maria Russia's complaints well Facebook has set a number of things in response to it on one they said they were too slow and addressing the problems that Maria brought to them and it wasn't until Maria\nProduced and published a three part investigative series that exposed the fact that there were these accounts that were spreading hate speech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts but as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly\nRecently in as a as I think it was an April Facebook is pain Murray arrest US Organization to be a third party fact checker of things that are going viral on Facebook in the Philippines\nBut as she put it to us recently they're completely inundated\nAnd Facebook still doesn't really have handled in the problem there does that suggest you know hiring her as a fact checker ... does that suggest Facebook is going to pursue and due diligence or they were just trying to plug the hole I think that that there are fact checking project that they are trying to do all around the world um\nIs what they're seen as the first step toward a solution or at least containing the problem of hate speech and misinformation to have\nPeople on the ground that are fact checking materials\nAnd to have people on the ground that are fact checking material in the home country or in the language and um it's really an outsourcing of it and what's also fascinated about it is that where your rent Reza runs a news organization and\nShe's utilizing resources that would otherwise be put toward reporting and doing fact checking riots going viral on Facebook\nYeah [noise] um if you zoom out of the Philippines a for a moment I mean many of us are closely watching Facebook's operations here in the U.S and abroad and the the big question which you raised several times are they doing enough at Facebook to stop these campaigns whether it's disinformation\nFake news hate speech uh what do you think after spending a year investigating all this and actually being at ... you know H Cuba for Facebook\nWell they um it's an interesting question because what does it mean enough and I asked people at Facebook you know what's the standard for success here because there is no ability for us to audit them were really left in the position of having to take their word for it and whatever\nIt is that the standard that they set for themselves but there's so much that we just don't know but as a ... this this is a writer Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic ah says in your dog and it's really it was a really powerful quote the very things that divide us the most are the things that get the most engagement um talk about that a bit and ... where that's most evident right now\nWell we've got our mid term elections and um and we've had you know that the horrific events here of the past week\nAnd scenes that whether it's the shooter in Pittsburgh or the attempted bomber um these are people that are very radicalized on social media polarization and filter bubbles are are a real thing on social media and this kind of\nFilter bubbles are are a real thing on social media and this kind of reinforcement of world views that's the main discussion happening right now I think\nJames after a year of working on this er and investigating Facebook or are you on the platform or what if you were or you know off it\nI I'm On it I've always taken uh I I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way it doesn't mean much in terms of what they are they're collecting around you um but ah it's just um [noise]\nYeah I'm I'm torn and sign up to ... who's in the film was a scholar at UNC\nUm says I think one of the most important lines which is what are you going to do about the fact that all your friends and family are there it's this tremendous thing to be able to communicate with people it really is an amazing invention budget is so problematic so ... what are you going to do\nJames Jacoby with frontline part two of the Facebook dilemma airs tonight on PBS and you can find part one on line at P. B.

headline here tuned to the world\n[laughter] [noise]\nAnd [noise] and [noise]\nDidn't tell me a bit of a reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nOver all although there has been expressions of condolence inexpensive shocking to hire\nThe the new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of it\nCondolence to the next person the shock of are\nThe new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact that we've had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand that for American Jews and synagogue is a second home it's a place where kids grow up and Hebrew school\nWhere they hide as I did like you know hiding out from from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would play and kind of come of age and that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I ... a share a story I did I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from where Ohio and I'm\nOne of the stories that move me most was the story of Jerry\nRuben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who are murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that is when he was shot\n'em and ethical moral and Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this\nInteresting custom dream orders cottage which is a Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up for the cash and that is traditionally a time it only those who are mourning actually stand up and when asked why did he stand up every single time he said\nWell I have no children so one day there will be nobody's to stand for me so I stand for all of those who I've known to stand for them and on Saturday everybody stood up and stood for Jerry and in his memory and I think um\nThat standing up at that standing up together is such a metaphor and I think\nOverall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need a synagogue given Jewish community because they had their Jewish community\nWithin their own lives and and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to find a sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the walls of a synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't connect\nThe president does reveal are quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you\nDo you know the president does reveal a quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\nHere [noise] [noise] me think um\n[noise] than American Jews and Israeli Jews are two very different paths right now I Would say American Jews for the most part are liberal like I said I'm so very much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support rights for immigrants they tend to very much believe in the Senate that's repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant would just\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much once the stranger in Egypt and so there's this very strong desire to knowledge that you know American Jews have done fairly wealthy themselves in in America\nI'm and feel fairly successful and so it's a very comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lens them to sort of be more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews still feel under attack they feel very much sort of the product of sort of post traumatic has Holocaust world where they look at things very much and it sort\nOf the earth on game at times you know a person's them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know\nI'm fresh from within somehow an Israeli the trend toward sort of like circling the wagons in fear and American jury you have a trend sort of towards plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think you should those divisions coming more clearly now and Pittsburgh\nAttached tragically in some ways highlights those splintered\n[noise]

it to warming and at that time we were just starting to understand what global warming was\nOver the years gates became a beloved teacher and an eternal optimist in a field whose future looks grim until her death gates led a research lab at the University of Hawaii that's trying to figure out ways to help coral adopt to warming oceans friend Virginia was says she was also a regular and vibrant public speaker\nI Will remember her ability to light up a room and make everyone in the room feel like she's talking just to them she had\nThis wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon and she was able to tell the story of corals and she was brilliant at it she really excelled at it\nI Know you've described her as an icon of closet or feel why\nSo she was and I kind of class and a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of assisted evolution of corals very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster\nTo be able to tolerate the heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that and but others\nThat's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that and but others led by roots really feel that we need to try a variety of options\nShe's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try it\nThen we can't know but personally I feel very strongly shoes and iconoclast in terms of the way she approached science she\nDisliked pushing your colleagues aside to get ahead and she was much more about cooperation and encouraging all diversity brown people and women and because of that sometimes she ruffled feathers but\nShe ruffled feathers to make the world at coral science a more inclusive cooperative place\nSuch determination to help his coral reefs are in the face of the past few years several major coral reef bleaching events\nAnd the rest of the news isn't good I mean coral reefs

great question Marco I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her life she just looked forward and she felt like\nYou know we can throw your hands up and give up or we can
