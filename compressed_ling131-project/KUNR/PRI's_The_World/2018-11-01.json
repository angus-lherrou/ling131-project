Ninety six to observe presidential campaigns and I've never seen anything quite like that\nEverybody here and there is in their respective camp and it's almost impossible to find anybody who is sitting on the fancy they're all in one camp all the ... and have very very strongly held views about Donald Trump he is the story\nAnd I don't get a sense that Americans are very happy politically right now even those who are on either side I think this is science of disconnect and it upsets people it's the same story everywhere we go\nOn happiness that really seems to be on the painting a lot of what we see and said this quiet I think which is permeating American society right now even the people who very strong Trump supporters and we'll probably see themselves as being in the ascendency so that's a hard road that I think Americans are taking right now\nSo the big question you're trying to answer talking to American voters is what matters to you how varied have those answers been extremely I may pay\nSupport as as I say Trump is being somebody who's just shaking up the country in a way that has never been done before\nAnd they believe that he's achieving things and they'll site North Korea is an example of that the tariff wars with China and the other side of the coin it's division it's the shouting out it's the singling out of minority groups and individuals that people find\nSingling out of minority groups and individuals that people find very offensive and drives a lot of their intentions in this midterm election\nYou know I mean that trade weren't terrorists that's not necessarily a good thing for people in the middle of the country farmers for example are you finding what\nThat is a fascinating thing you know we were just in Breckenridge, Minnesota just a few days ago and we conducted little focus group that primarily amongst farmers and what they told us was that even though China's not buying their crops the down by about twenty five percent and returns\nThat were prepared to give Donald Trump a chance to sort out this war with the Chinese but then would speak to other ... that is well and good but ... now full and if we can solve this problem out really soon we got to have another habit snakes human not going to have anything to do with that\nSo it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal to cause can out why the hip pocket and as we call it in stride but usually motivates what people's biting intentions of going to be\n... have you ever seen that dynamic like that back in Australia it's very rare\nExcept in as strategy we do have something of a Trump phenomena and it usually comes with people who once calling the shots in a society where they feel they're being left out left behind\nAnd I will sometimes support candidates who don't represent their interests and that happened a few years ago when we had a woman called polling Hansen she's still around and she ran a particular one nation very populist and\nShe was upsetting Asians and Asian tourists to strike but people in tourists dependent electric was voting for her and say yeah sometimes people vote against their interests I read an article once said what took you\nPeople vote against their interests I read an article once and it said was ... Thanksgiving sometimes that it just happens to the question now I think that we're going to have to be asking in two years' time if we come back as well\nHas Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because right now what we're saying is that people who might be sitting in the middle I'm more inclined to cite will give him a chance we're going to see how you guys and that's my main that the cycle blue why that is coming might just be more of a trickle\nHow much does an issue like immigration or what we're talking about earlier ... how much did the opinions you heard from Americans vary depending on the region well\nIt depended to a large extent actually in South Carolina you cannot get away from rice as an issue\nAnd people of color they were very very distressed they felt that that will being singled out by Donald Trump and in fact we buy two Seventy seven year old man African American who grew up in the eyes of segregation in South Carolina had refused admission in the lunch counters in restaurants and\nSort it as roars and he said he had never seen anything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he had never seen such of racism and he's view coming from a president does somebody in such high office he said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but he'd never felt this roar exposure\nThat's extraordinary [noise] Bruce you've been in the U.S before and as you know the mid term elections historically have low voter turnout what's it like in Australia or greater sense there that you have to take care of the civic responsibility of casting a vote\nWilling to strike have compulsory ... at stake in that responsibility out of our hands and\n... that's taken that responsibility out of our hands and tell us we'll be fond if we die hard but estranged taken for granted really that they have divided on election day and we have Ninety five percent turnout\nAnd then of course changes the nature of politics ... it means that the politicians are much more focused on the Santa Robin having to energize the base all the time\nIf you are have compulsory biting your politician industry you know that your traditional voters are going to come out and support you it's the people in the middle you have to convince and that means that extreme politics even though it sounds very divisible times\nStill is much more inclusive in the basic tenants that I'm the pain the major political parties for example\nAh you know we have a national hills game which would never be touched by either at the major parties I don't think the model I've taught it just is not an issue that I Know that if I were to the pot from that that would be the end of the prospects of winning an election\nDo you get the sense that Americans are more motivated to go to the polls this year\nMore motivated everywhere we go we're hearing reports from journalists and others that turnout is greater with early voting mental so registration that the Kevin uh issue has motivated and energized democratic voters particularly women\nSo on both sides with seeing this remarkable energizing I'd be very surprised if we can say ... me too I'm voting turnout and we're also getting at reports that in states like Georgia where there's been allegations of vote as a profession\nThat that is how to read this effect and that there's been a very high turnout before the election day by people who presumably are offended by what's happening there\nAnd one of the things that are being doing is talking to young people and asking them well what do you\nAnd one of the things that are being doing is talking to young people and asking them well what do you think about Donald Trump in the priority says he has and they basically say\nThat totally out of step with what we are worried about and the number one issue that we get back is climate change because this is the generation that's going to have to deal with these problems and the other is intergenerational debt but they really do worry about climate and climate change\nAnd you can understand why you know I wouldn't be around to see the worst effects of climate change but they will not think that will become a bigger and bigger issue as this generation starts to assert more and more power\nBruce Walker is an Australian political strategists he's been filming a documentary called a hard road travels and Trump's America we'll speak with him again after the midterms\nBy the way if you're a new U.S citizen are voting for the first time here in America we want to hear from you what does voting mean to you and how does it compare with voting in another country\nEmail us at this address my world at the world dot org again that's my world at the world dot O. R. G.\nWhen the news headlines are coming up next year with the world [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nOr you had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end\nThe reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of\nWhat he asked me to do but at a point an news story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone magazine that I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job or not\nI'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border of five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans have probably says how we have an invasion coming a we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down there since the idea that we're going to be decisive flipper really defending what we ought to do is put in drones out to get targeting Hindu airstrikes on the migrant convoy and just stop it\nBefore it gets close but of course that's absurd\nAnd that's immoral and that's not something that we're even thinking about doing but we shouldn't even send the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the Alamo however in some ways it is a crisis\nIt's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of a number of people who want entry into the United states in many cases they have a pretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras or Guatemala\nA lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal with a moral issue so I think it's when we talk about putting military around we almost confused the issue because the route issue here is one of our immigration policy\nCause the route issue here is one of our immigration policy and in America's values and we've got to look in the mirror decide what our values are adjust our policy reflects those and it's got to be a compromise because not all Americans are going to agree\nSo how do you feel our country is being led laid off from me what is your take on the on the tone things up by the oval office\nI don't think our country is being led well it All right now but I Would expanded beyond the oval office I Would say on the left in the right there's ... to the rhetoric now\nAnd this gets back to what we talked about earlier in values we need instead of looking at the TV and yelling at whatever side we don't like we need to look in the mirror and we need to say All right what are our values what do we want from our leaders because I don't expect the president to have the answers\nI expect the president to create an ecosystem in which the answers can be reached but I expect the president to reflect our values I expect to reflect the values for me I\nI expect the president to inspire me to be better than I might otherwise be what I Am weary and impatient I expect the president to be the kind of symbol it says well I Need to be a little more patient I lead to be a little more energetic whatever it is I Need to be a little more courageous a little more compassionate\nI expect the president to reflect all the things that we hope we can be\nAn does Donald Trump reflect your values does it reflect American values\nWell I think each of us has to ask ask ourselves that question\nI'm Madeleine you dizzy reflect your values general\nI think I just answered that question I I don't believe that President Trump reflects the kind of inspirational leadership that I\nPresident Trump reflects the kind of inspirational leadership that I respond to but I'm One person and the real question is how each of us do and we need to we need to be very honest with ourselves first and then with each other\n[noise] General Stanley McChrystal his new book is leaders myth unreality thank you very much for being with us oh it's my pleasure\nBoat

least Seventy ritual ... like the one here in Exeter were performed throughout New England\nThey were attempts to stop the spread of the devastating and then little understood disease of tuberculosis\nThere are times in life when you need to have an answer you need to have a course of action not just sit there and what your family die and so folklore provided an avenue for this this\nParticular brand of folklore was a variant on a practice born in places like\nParticular brand of folklore was a variant on a practice born in places like Romania hungry and Germany\nThe idea was that one of the dead victim's was not in fact dead but keeping itself alive in the grave by feeding on the blood and flash of the living to stop it you had to find it and eradicate it\nThey would usually cut out that Oregon that had the fresh blood whether it was heart liver lungs whatever\nBell says these practices we're likely introduced a New England by traveling quacks and this seemed curious magical full practice also provided inspiration to European writers who develop their own version of the vampire myth one we know\nWell today to pop culture and fiction the vampires in New
