like you and I want to start with just what's going on right now what everybody's paying attention to which is what do you think is going on in the stock market at the moment\nA dollar more sellers and buyers strong [laughter] that was the question of more seriously uh it's essentially the movement of long term interest rates moving higher\nAnd concurrently the wage rights are being pressured but mainly interest rates and it's creating this a fairly significant adjustment a it's a typical not unexpected\nBut whenever you get to the spread between the five year treasury note on the thirty year bond opening up which is what has happened you have a significant impact on stock prices\nBut this is not a big surprise to anybody that the fed has been saying for a long time that that interest rates were eventually going to go back up again why do you think the market is reacting like this\nWell I think it's basically the combination of not what the fed is doing\nWhich remember the short term interest rates and it's what the market itself is doing\nFor the ten year treasury note and say the thirty year treasury bond they've moved up significantly and that's where the major business decisions are determined\nOut at the scale of other when it's ten years Fifteen Years out not overnight which is largely whatever comes from\nIs there anything that the ...\nIt comes from\nIs there anything that the government can do um about this either through monetary policy or a fiscal policy or should they do anything or just let things happen as they do\nWell we're in the process of adjustment and we've had interest rates in this country at the lowest level in American history\nWithout coming out of it and gradually adjusting\nSo long as long term interest rates were just I said is a critical factor continue to rise the pressure was going to be down would on stock prices but it's very difficult to say where it goes from here because the pundits have been right half the time\nAnd President Trump has been saying that interest rates should stay low that the fed is moving too quickly\n[noise] uh\nWas in the Federal Reserve and elsewhere for more than Twenty years and I

coming down from Georgia and it being battled over legal race\nPretty much what we had what we have here it is big industry and go but not really taking care of us down here and you know kind of like I got a buddy lives in Georgia this this\nAnd you know kind of like I got a buddy lives in Georgia that says the rain that falls in Georgia, Georgia water but then when they get too much crime they send it to ... down the river and I know that people have land is going to have water to drink and they will but\nUh they should have thought about this for years ago\nBefore I let them get as big as they are you know I mean that all men Tommy ... for about four hundred acres of ... and we spent tons of money about six years ago to you know when our lease but with the water we got coming down there just as it didn't work out\nAnd I would have never so when I was a kid that\nI was going to pay eighty nine dollars for a second old they are not at all if you needed any Eighteen hundred

that there's\nDefeat going on here so funny we're walking overly stuffed shells as we now\nI'm looking out on this day it looks gorgeous can we describe what what is the grass it's over there just got really healthy marsh is throughout the outlets Kobe that one of the protective factors in terms of talking about the storm that has come in\nMarshes protect from storm surge flooding so those are going to slow down wind and rain Florida waster population Ninety percent of it was coming from the Appalachian coal a bay ten percent of it nationwide and and that's changed dramatically over the past couple of years the oysters an indicator species right at the Keystone feces\nIf you have a healthy oyster population and the scientists will tell you guess while you're going to find out you've got healthy fishy about healthy\nIt's like you're going to find out you've got healthy fishy about healthy crowds you got healthy shrimp and so when you see this challenge with the oysters guess what you're going to probably find out you got challenges going on with their other parts of your system\nYou're the river keeper you're charged with the keeping of this river just your thoughts about the emotional importance of having a healthy river\nI Would sound very selfish if I was to say I was the only person in love with this river and really get why it is incumbent upon us to protect and take care of it this is the one of a ... place I could rattle off all the special environmental ecological designations for you\nBut you can just walk around town and talk to people and ask them what the river may mean to them and you will get\nYou will get many stories of why people love this place that are fiercely protective of it\nAnd they include scientists and researchers say\nWe've retreated to deliver keepers office a boat you had to be called off the bat whether Dr Felicia Komen director of Florida state's coast and we love her colleague Dr Sondra brook\nAnd write ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection join us I start by asking Dr column and that question we started with why do we care about this\nI'd say the most spectacular fishery collapses have occurred worldwide on rivers that have had tremendous re diversion of water because that that water bringing all his nutrients is not coming down into the selling aided water and coming down anymore such a really important component\nComing down anymore such a really important component I think that's overlooked\nWell and talk more about that Dr brook because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish growth it's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like well he's just like the conch which like the salty water\nYes when the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happen the problem with soldiers that encourages these marine credited such an oyster drills and ground called\nAbout these oyster drills that sounds like a horror film ducked Dr ... tell us more they latch onto the oysters and they like that come out\nA sit down on an oyster and then all of a sudden they always to his this scrape scrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and tickets for buses in and basically consume the always to from within and there's not a whole lot they always to can do about it it is rather horrific\nCan check it out on YouTube it's [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I think some people wonder why the bay wasn't just shut down so that it could replenish\nStart with the day and\nA an ecosystem because if we don't address the problems with the ecosystem if\nWe're constantly reacting one of the things that happened\nIn the wake of the oil spill was at a fisherman were allowed to go out and harvest all the oysters and the fear was that the spill would come in and kill the shows in a couple of years later and there was no brood stock left there to re populated I think about the function the set oysters surfaces beyond ...\nSurface is beyond the economics like clean water but they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevices\nThey help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry without that resource you can't have good sea grass beds without that the oyster resource you can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things\nBut you have to do it in a deliberate fashion\nOne of the problems with the bay over the last few decades has been\nReaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a water flow planting a coach out there and if that\nPaul ... is the only stir shell what they larval oysters settled on but distributing it without a plan you might as well be casting it all into the when what\nWould you recommend I mean we haven't even mentioned climate change and the drought that have been a part of the fresh water coming in from the river drying up ... you say it has to be deliberate what does it have to be\nTheir particular types of research that can be done that could\nRelatively quickly and the next couple of years make some very good decisions about how we restore the bay the fisherman really understand what's needed but they want their livelihood restored so there's a tendency to go for whatever looks like the quickest fix closing the best probably not a terrible idea\nI think you would find fishermen that fully support that will do to Brooke ... research and really committed effort instead of throwing short term\nCommitted effort instead of throwing short term solutions what about in desalination plant I think\nThey're up more problems in the bay unjust salinity you know they had the drought back in two thousand seven and nine and since then we've had decent rainfall but they always just haven't come back\nIt's usually want a system crashes it's not just one thing but there are also other factors in play you know the the ... they're not as high as they used to be we don't know where the lobby\nOf coming from or what does the ... the bay looked like you know how much of the coach sits where it is it's all these questions that will help us\nFigure out a way of making a comeback\nHe this is so interesting because after Sandy we did a lot of reporting on people who wanted to bring the oyster beds back to New York harbor it used to be filled with ... as a barrier against that storm coming in you know pass a statue of liberty is a solution aquaculture and we're all shaking your head to know\nYour environment window where it's not

resolving this rather quickly\nWhat does it tell you that none of these so far have exploded\n\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are Boston and carbon night offering secure data protection solutions for growing businesses including automatic back up for servers and computers I availability and disaster recovery solutions and automated data migration learn more carbon I dot com\nIt's here now\nMore carbon I dot com\nIt's here now and we're in Florida head of the midterms and also after hurricane Michael cut an unbelievable ... through the Florida Panhandle in the northwest part of the state just truly unbelievable to see a looming crisis homelessness\nFEMA and aid groups like the American Red Cross providing temporary shelter but then what especially for the poor and low income\nWhere we can McCarthy is a senior news producer with W F F you and me and I know you and your colleagues have been really pulling at this threat is quite a story\nMichael ... fold more than two weeks ago but so many people still displaced do we know how many\nRight when we last spoke with FEMA they told me there are more than a thousand people in shelters at this point and of course we know that not everyone who was displaced by the storm are are those people in the shelter so we can imagine that that number is much greater than not you know thousand or so people will\nSomebody with family or friends or in cars uh your colleague Lynn had her spoke with tons of Denise Graham she was a victim from a low income housing project in Panama City because of the storm damage was listen\nWe want to make\nMoney [laughter] [laughter]\nWillingly life [laughter] I don't know what I Want [laughter]\nAny more\nSo you multiply her I'm sure by many and she has been approved for FEMA rental assistance we forget about it I mean she was in low income housing but there are all these renters who don't have any recourse she got to see ... rental assistance and his waiting on a check\nTo see ... rental assistance and his waiting on a check 'em but but then what I mean where she's supposed to she can find housing but we're supposed to find housing\nRight that's that's the difficult thing is that there aren't a lot of places available right now for housing and FEMA\nHas made some hotels available on their their vouchers said that you can use to stay these hotels but many of them are outside of the hardest hit areas so people have to have transportation to get there really there's about twenty that are accepting those ...\nAnd did you say you know trailers are on the way people think about those FEMA trailers\nBut there seems to be a you know some slow down in the process they say they need to work with local governments they can't just come in there and say here we come we're putting these trailers here the local governments need to ask for it and of course those local governments are are still putting themselves back together and so I think that's why we're seen sort of this slow response and\nThey're also shelter is of course yeah ... well a and by the way\nWe see FEMA people all over the place in their boots teachers they're working very hard you spoke with Michelle chestnut though she was staying in a shelter in a local high school and just when I listen to how\nWe say we're in charge and maybe it was just like all the windows busted out back\nAll the trees come down and landed right beside the church though you know I'm I'm a at her house was destroyed a brother in law does houses destroyed you know a lot of wealth or home\nWell so first of all clarify for us because driving around this has driven home or in the panhandle people might be picturing in Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes are beach homes not\nThis is a part of Florida where we have a lot more rural people a lot more low income people and so these is there even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are homes that have been handed down\nWho maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are homes that have been handed down for generations and so since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have health insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have that way chipped to begin rebuilding their homes\nWill and rebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from ... or Walmart manager in Mariana who said people are showing up for work even though they have really trying circumstances let's hear\nWe're getting some company called one of them is the ability of loss loss we got here\nAnd so I've got like I've got a system as we call him Dr loss is allowed\nAfter three days he's in here\nThrough smiling and grace is going to just write he has a job that he can recover from and the law says that there's more calls\nWhen he says we got air he means is he conditioning air conditioned right how are people getting by they have no income I think that it's\nTough I'm hearing from people who who are very concerned about eight Gilmore had opened his store and it wasn't open to the public but he was allowing his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup process so that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck there is some unemployment like specifically storm related unemployment assistance available through the state\nBut again that's difficult for is a fisherman who maybe don't have a good way of tracking\nWhat their income has been and so they don't have a good way of applying for that assistance\nWell running water mostly back in some places it's not drinkable communications as we have discovered are still pretty spotty um it's just really I have to say it's just remarkable to see the trees uprooted\nIt's just really I have to say it's just\nRemarkable to see the trees uprooted everywhere even hear it you know inland Tallahassee ruse off high school fifty miles inland it's really a quite humbling a as I say F. S. W. F. as you senior news producer of Reagan McCarthy thanks so much for sharing your appointment I think you\nWould have been talking about housing even those able to return to homes and it's unbelievable again will have pictures that here in our dot org are having trouble hearing those cars Bentley went to the coast and brought back this luck [noise]\nMuch of\nThe area between Mexico beach in Port saint Joe looks like a hurricane went through yesterday not two weeks ago cars in boats are turned on their sides strewn across the street from the bonds homes are split wide open there's debris everywhere but for those able to return to their homes just part of the Florida Panhandle as one big construction sites [noise]\nTroy Bryant's watches as workers tear the shingles off his room [noise] they're they're born all changed I just had the new route but all last September\nBryant and his wife ... bought this beachfront property and moved here from Georgia earlier this year they stayed in a hotel in Mariana Florida during the storm in return two days later to find their new home intact but severely damaged\nWell when I first drove up I thought well that's a you know the garage doors with money but I thought was not so bad [noise]\nOutside to the back door the garage and it opened up and then this is what you're saying here [noise]\nI had a white picket fence that we just built all around the front of the house are part of it in the back part of it in the garage [noise]\nThat house right there\nUsed to be right there\nBrian says that house is forty feet from where you\nBrian says that house it's forty feet\nFrom where it used to be innocent Allen Cronin live a few blocks from the beach they were on vacation in Tennessee when the storm hit and when they came back they found four feet of water swept through the building they also saw whole houses lifted off their foundations and swept into the streets by the storm surge and high when\nThis second lock most album\nHave some sort of damage course they there's was pushed up for it got kind of total you know\nAnd there is a house in the street in front of your house\nCatty corner that block\nAnd stuff when the storm surge came up and started flooding of course and it just ... around\nOf course you'd say our neighbors car wound\nThe Cronin are spending their new retirements repairing their house by hand living at a camp or in their backyard they're determined to stay but Allen Cronin says this area will never be the same\nBase a large percentage of these homes that were owned\nBy grandma grandpa\nGrandma and grandpa was not going to rebuild and your\nGrandma and grandpa squirrel settling\nI keep in mind that a third to half the houses here we're actually built you before Nineteen Seventy they were literally not built to any hurricane go they were built for\nAnd people have lived in them for years\nNow they're not going to live for many more and in five years this will be the same place it was\nLifelong resident Clark downs and his daughter Kimberly downs Norton rode out the storm and carts house\nI was confident on a category one and two but then after I realized it was going to be a three or four it was too late\nAnd likely we will survive today\nAnd luckily we we survive\nToday they are helping their neighbors clear down trees from this yard Clark says Michael was a historic storm\nThere's a history here ah of even when I started school here in in elementary school there's a book called the great time where the city was destroying three pounds one's a far west by yellow fever and wants a tidal wave which was really a hurricane so Ken this is number four combat what he said I just know that people are combat that and I'm Sorry\nYou're already building well yeah I've got three for ... and I've got two people come in to straighten some of the messages out so yeah oh yeah what do you think it really\nHow do you think decisive change or for well I don't think it'll change and I was thinking of a market for all we can say more at the stars at night now [laughter] you know we had so many trees at four in the yard and we couldn't see this ... now and see all the stars that are\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

up just right to make it work properly\nOr I got a four point seven six to ... were nuts yeah you're on it on okay good good\nI'm Dr Andy ... with your solar research Institute and we are at the edge of a pit that we're excavating dating from modern stuff right at the top all the way down to potentially maybe Fifteen thousand years ago some of the earliest occupation\nNot only in Florida but in the new world wow we're kind of just getting to the the good stuff as we get through the earliest Holocene material and get into the end of the ice age the end of the terminal places the material\nWill be looking at things in the twelve to fourteen and it's like I said as much as Fifteen thousand year old range [noise]\n\nBuckets are lined up shovels gently first class tickets for ... thousands of years that every ... castle exacting work you never know what you might\n[noise] we've been finding stone tools just somebody knock the big flake off it was really sharp on when it so they took a little um a piece of amber or another\nHammer stone perhaps interest sharpened it up a little bit more a drill the tip of broken off of that and we're probably guessing and again in the\nFive six thousand year old range part of today's excitement has been that we had a little lens of charcoal and as we dug it out this morning it started to have some structure to it on Tom said perhaps corn cob it a corn cob shouldn't be in nine thousand year old dirt share but it's conceivable\nSo so that'll be the that will be the excitement this afternoon is removing this little pedestal that's got quite a bit of charcoal in it\nRemoving this little pedestal that's got quite a bit of charcoal in it [noise]\n\nThe scraped material is dumped into the buckets and poured out over what looks like a screen door laying on its side on legs now move over here to have a a screen everybody knows what this looks like it's framed and you're brushing that than through what are you looking

an I'm an ... or an sharpening arrowhead or a projectile points and then make these little tiny flakes\nOkay you sound went down there a larger one larger when it's a half a quarter of an inch long yeah that's a big yeah that's a big one\nHow do you know that's what they were doing that\nThere is there is a man for the call these primitive arts festivals where people are making arrowhead today and this is a Denver ties that is what's on the floor after they get through making a same during appointed except ... this is probably ten thousand years old [noise]\nI just touch something ten thousand you know right this is cool [noise]\nWell that may it wasn't my hand that Dr heading who just wiped out a few hundred years of history with one says oh there's so many ways to mess up here [laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nIt's funny\n[noise] [laughter]\nIt's funny but the reason he slipped may not be\nArtifacts are most beneficial to archaeologists they reveal their story best when they're found where they were left and storms like recent hurricane Michael can disturbed that if you stand in a\nPlace long enough you can feel the same ... you know a little bit and it's caused you know it's no into problems and education's\nDo you think that's the rain as you as you shake your ... with the elements to just now\nIt importantly [laughter] um\nBut these things are thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nSure if they're in place and not currently ... and that's really why we were so very concerned is that we have an open excavation pitted almost a meter deep with soils would have not seen the letter day for the better part a nine thousand years\nWe've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered this with tarps sandbag the whole thing and we we got off awful like\n[noise] and so they continue the work that was started by an angel devoted his life to saving the history beneath Florida soil and found this site when a sewer pipes was laid\nThe original work was done by the then said archaeologist Calvin Jones just along the sidewalk outside the large in Nineteen Ninety four and that's when some of the most important earliest fines were made\nCalvin Jones isn't he the one who got a wheelbarrow of loan delivered to his home and he's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he yeah the Jackson has and he's the one who said wait a second this there is more than dirt is part of this ancient burial site yeah here\nThey had a delivery of dirt and\nA search and within the ... there were\nThat is archaeologist Barbara causes a Florida public archaeology network\nAnd we've traveled to the place where Calvin Jones got his loan and realized it held treasures it's now the lake Jackson mounds archeology state park in Tallahassee a beautiful carpet of lung leading to grass covered hills rise like the facts of green elephants one bigger than the others said\nOkay we walked across that vast lawn and there it is I mean how how high near would you say this ... this is the\nTallest of the southern mountains it is thirty six feet tall these mountains were built basket by basket load of dirt\nAnd let's just backup what exactly is the mound this\nSite is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern regions version of the Mississippi in culture known by many as the mount builders\nOver time they would build these mountains and their leader would live on top of the mountain a hut when that person past they would then be and hurt are buried in the mountains and their home would be burns and then they would cap it off with more soil\nAnd then the next leader with live on top of it so overtime became taller and taller and you can actually see those different layers of soil if you were to kind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burn homes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplit us climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral\nOr is that it's a place that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just\nYou you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die today it's definitely a very respectful kind of foreboding place\nI feel that but we are going to climate stairs to the top of it as a as a leader would've done hundreds of years ago so here we go [noise]\n\nAre there native peoples who are direct descendants of the people who lived here the\nDescendants of the people who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana and come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we're not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up\nThe mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty I Know there's concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking since the year one thousand AD\nThese mountains and we're right on top now these now have weathered when did a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mountains would be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part of the mountain and then you have an open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains here we are ready on\nTop of the smell and we have all this growth so the leader of a community would get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now\nOn the big long where they'd all be living this was strategic\nOn the big long where they'd all be living\nThis was strategically placed over here to our east we have a lake Jackson I always tell people when you're looking for archaeological sites you look for your basic needs food water and shelter there are other sites similar to this throughout the south east all the way up through the Mississippi Valley up into Ohio even when they were excavating here at like Jackson\nThey were finding copper brass plates or ... ... it's we don't have proper in Florida\nSo it was evidence of trade with those other places\nUnderstanding this mound when it was excavated there would be a family there was a dog at one point\nThey found women they found one child I Believe he was about eleven years old and yes there was a dog burial\nWhy is it so important is again a thousand to Fifteen
