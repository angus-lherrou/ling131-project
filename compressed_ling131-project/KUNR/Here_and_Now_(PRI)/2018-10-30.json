S.\nAnd Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says he will introduce legislation that mirrors what the president wants to do\nJoining us now is Alan Gomez who covers immigration for USA Today Hi Allan Hi German and birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment which ah reads all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and of the state where in their reside\nSo how could President Trump a undo that by executive order\nTo very good question um you know you just read the fourteenth amendment that was preceded by the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty six and both of those were affirmed in Eighteen Ninety eight by the U.S Supreme Court\nWho to throw in one more quote wrote the fundamental principles citizenship by birth within the dumb Indian was reaffirmed the most explicit and comprehensive terms\nSo it's a pretty high legal hurdle to to climb when something is in law in the U.S constitution and upheld by the U.S Supreme Court but um there have been some concern\nAnd upheld by the U.S Supreme Court but um there have been some conservative I'm sort of anti immigration groups in recent years who have seized on the phrasing that you said subject to the jurors to extend their of\n'em they're claiming that somebody who was an undocumented immigrant in this country is still a national of their home country they're claiming that people who come here through birth tourism so a Chinese think of a Chinese national coming to the United states when they're pregnant\nGiving birth here just so that their child has US citizenship and then returning back to China they're claiming those kinds of cases um do not fall within the fourteenth amendment um but as we've heard from those from the amendment\nAnd from the Supreme Court it's very very high legal\nHurdle to climb one there are many who will look at this and say we're a week before the midterm elections and this is just a political move that he wants to excite his base even if he doesn't have any intention of actually doing this or he knows that it will go nowhere in the courts\nYeah the timing is incredible because it's not just this I mean you look at the fact that he has been hammering on the migrant caravan coming up through Mexico for weeks now I'm declaring it a national emergency and just this week and his administration announcing that they're going to send five thousand\nActive duty military troops down to the U.S border to stop them that's on top of already Twenty one hundred National Guards men that are down patrolling the border to stop what is now about thirty five hundred migrants um that are trying to make their way up\nI'm so there he's really seizing upon immigration I mean this was a strategy that worked for him obviously in twenty sixteen and when they're trying to combat what many are predicting will be this blue wave in this midterm election\nHe's just going back to the playbook that worked for him and saying hey\nHe's just going back to the playbook that worked for him and saying hey let's just hammer down on immigration over and over and see if that works\nAnd those migrants are that you're talking about by the way they're a over a month away from the United states by walking and that's if they go about thirty miles per day\nData O'Connor will be into hosted through\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

Krueger combination of nine or ... during which remember short term interest rates and that's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note until you're thirty two year treasury bond very moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts it already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nTo impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with him about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America a history which he co authored with Adrian ... rich I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more than two\nIt's more directly related to a structure of somebody for example the so called rust belt who's popular\nThe so called rust belt is populated largely by industries which are very old\nSilicon Valley for example is a classic case of a very new\nThere are very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation\nThrew out the country and it depends obviously whether Iran is Gregory in areas where as soybeans prices means something or whether you're on the west coast to\nWhere the issue of high tech stock prices a little everyone talks about so one thing about this country which is very diverse at a depends where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge added this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of a new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell on the lookout into the future all we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity\nFlying uh well basically because fear you know when to deal with fear it is very difficult to classify it\nBut you can you can look at the consequences of it I'm a consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment\nAnd uh just inclination to take risks in the book and suddenly I might add discussing what are the lowest the long term outlook is all about\nShe was all over the long term outlook is all about\nUh we say that the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements as having a significant negative deterioration over the long run the reason for that is what the data under critically show is that\nEntitlements which are mandated by law a gradually and inexorably driving out gross domestic savings and the economy\nDollar for dollar and so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit and uh we're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners\nBut what this is causing this is largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging\nRight now the official actuaries of their Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds and balance they'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent indefinitely into the future to do you think they should do that\n[laughter] for civil or do I think it's going to happen I don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there\nSo long as you don't do it could cause the debt overall total government that go over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation\nAnd that is an unstable situation where\nYou say inflation ... it's a big problem out there who we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nBut that's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about uh for example interest rates and fifth century bc Greece when not terribly different from wherever they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we kept rates low as ... unemployment rate so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace the dot com boom which no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't see that the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below a brief usual expectation of like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept falling below four percent\nRed kept fooling below four percent with no impact on inflation\nSo if those low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand\nI think that what we specifically learned strangely for the first time in two thousand mood is there a two conditions as crowded for a crisis\nWarnings or talks as like a security has to mortgages but the critical issue is how those mortgages and financed and one day or finance or by liberal reached that that's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now no not in any area\nWell I don't want to be a general\nI don't know that that was a very extraordinary period in court narrowed it would've been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve to keep rates down during the period of very low unemployment that was what the period was\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said that one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nA for jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that is going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's not\nAbout that well basically it's it's not lower productivity but it's an issue or when you get the sort of tight labor market\nWage rates begin to rise of necessity and it's the wage rate rises which affect the cost of production and hence induce corporations to start raising prices basically because their costs are going up\nThat's where the problem is that as a really big on that\nI Want to ask you about one more big thing that you talk about in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all I explain what that means\nA creative destruction is the process by which people do two things they continuously invest but the investment is displacing\nOlder equipment but more importantly it engenders unemployment and uh\nIt's to process which unfortunately is a necessary condition for growth and standards of living\nYou have to let bad things happen in order for the overall picture to be better in the future\nWell because the very nature of progress economically as we point out on the book\nIs the result of creative destruction which means essentially for example when uh they open hearth ... been in the steel industry a whole slew of procedures within the steel industry so called best of my furnace\nWithin the steel industry so called ... furnaces they became obsolete and they were scraps but also workers associated with those

which has been in the news because of this tragedy it's leafy streets and historic houses much of the population is Jewish\nBut it's also Mr Rogers actual neighborhood it's we're Fred Rogers lived when he was making his show\nA show we wish we had help us through a week like this\nWere British ... is executive director with the Fred Rogers center she's with us\nFrom ... Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was born a he moved to grow hill when he got married uh Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell they this is really sad day in the neighborhood [laughter] um I Know that ... ... ... the community that ... there's going to be in the community and we're all hell and um he loves walking down the streets and\nHell and um he loved walking down the streets and\nI'm noticing the trees and then the various temples and synagogues and churches um that own made him feel at home um that they grief that delicatessens and he often commented that you could hear yet ... Hebrew and a dozen other languages spoken\nAs he walked down the street of that community\nHe actually learned uber to me\nHe did yes ah\nDo you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on squirrel hill\n[noise] um\n[noise] then the Mr Roger's neighborhood I think I'm a certainly had some of the philosophy of the squirrel hill neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighborhood the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another\nWhich certainly I think with reflected to him through the ... community and probably also taken the lead probe community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence\nOr we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination that word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and the puppet Daniel tiger I had this question for lady ...\nFascination me [noise]\nHave you heard that word a lot today\nHave you heard that word a lot today\nAnd I didn't know what it means\nWell [noise]\nIt means\nSomebody getting killed in a\nSort of surprised way that's what happened you know that killed that other man\nI Know in a lot of people are talking about it right now too many people are talking about a lot of people are\nSad scared about it you know [noise]\nI'd rather talk about some other day whenever you like [noise]\nThat sound are courtesy of the Fred Rogers company laid ... lady Evelyn goes on to change the subject to a picnic but Daniel tigers as he doesn't feel like a picnic\nA she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh\n[noise] well I think one of the things that he taught us how old is that it's All right to have these feelings to see a fad and to feel angry and to be afraid that there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nGrown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to grim naps were\nListening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often sets\nWhat they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area what we saw where all the helpers the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses everyone\nUm have surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with said that they identify with the\nThe helpers and not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen that line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days looked for the helpers\nYes\nAs part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence whistles and\nI've been terribly concerned about the graphic display of violence\nWhich the mass media has been showing recently\nAnd I plead for your protection in support of your young children\nThere is just so much that a very young child can take with out of being overwhelming [noise]\nWhat do you think for Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of that is to find\nIt probably is helpful is for all of us to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but he also think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good next attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermine that message so looking for the helpers helps the see the good that is still around us\nFrank Rogers said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean this life and be hateful or we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children it and and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative ways\nTo were British ... what do you think Fred Rogers and you knew Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nWell I think he would be horrified by what happened and and he would\nHe would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions to the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn that the feelings are normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express anger and find ways to express sadness\nI'm In ways that are not harmful to other people um and you know I think that that comforting neighborhoods um I think he would also say we need to turn to our neighbors and\nUm I think he would also said we need to turn to our neighbors sand neighbor in the greater sense of the world and everyone who lives on this planet is a neighbor I'm ... and and to provide support\nTo our neighbors to people of all backgrounds from all faiths symbolic rates that we can live together on the third and very productive place\nWhat's this been like for you living right there outside Pittsburgh\nYeah it's um well I think very hard I've

G. of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but uh he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big uh ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMike DeWine was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor\nOur former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties um and served with him\nOr so but he has been very staunch up against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed against a a filed in a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea\nOf having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions but he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nAll right let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we are going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminals\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let ... it's my turn an outrage and ... and they get out it's my on your program and they get shot out or it's like OK here's Cordray getting a word and\nAre the worst states in the nation the Trump Administration CDC report should we have the highest increase in ... last year and he sees in the nation\nCDC reports should we have the highest increase in November of last year and he sees in the nation are if so what we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day of because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand\nAnd one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes and take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say um you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but\nUh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so\nThere is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment\nFor them is that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or order people what's on their minds\nIt seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it um Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and would they keep\nIn conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and would they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you well at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind that the most recent polling shows us that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters uh we do have in this election that can vote\nAnd um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal at Ohio\nIt is a big deal it's always a big deal\nThat Ohioans have approved at a ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to\nPlay out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good opportunity to get in there and help draw those lines and I have some effect on it\nAs joined goes who covers politics at Ohio public radio talking about the governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you\nRepresentatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plane manufacturer Boeing to discuss what caused a seven thirty seven ... a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning the plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash joining us to have said Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\n... and we know that shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down well\nA lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people are saying that the plane was essentially going a radically doing things that we don't usually experience during fly my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like\nSomething more than that something perhaps to do with air speed indicators\nAnd a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know if that played into this uh you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going you could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that has happened in my mind goes to a\nA crash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil or back in two thousand nine Air France flight more for seven yeah uh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things uh a mechanical issues some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but\nUh you know as much a cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes\nOr which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly and the pilots\nUh you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so a very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened day before that\nSomething like that based on what seems to have happened day before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that it'll slated flight\nNow when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new airplane it had flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out enough and and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nAs it's so new I ... and and yeah you know legitimate to say that on the other hand you know we've all flown on on brand new airplanes and in fact you know this this max aid is is the newest kind and there are already hundreds around the world\nOf flying you know for that matter the airlines like American in southwest here in the U.S airlines like Air Canada and west jet just north of the border\nAnd and you know of course this is also very rare for something like that so sure at this point you can ... you could construct all kinds of ah you know ideas about why this could have happened\nUh but you know the newness of an airplane in and of itself shouldn't cause something any more than ... ... you know a very old airplane as long as it's maintained properly\nBut we're not talking here nobody is talking about pilot error nobody is talking about whether anything like that they're they're looking investigated it appears or looking mostly just at the mechanics of this airplane\nComing up Saturday the tens of November details and tickets at Great Basin Brewing Company dot com [noise]\nFunding
