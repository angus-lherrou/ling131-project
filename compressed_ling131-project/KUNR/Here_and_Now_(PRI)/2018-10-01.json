I was working in the place and I was told to go to new Scotland yard and get some testing done with don't just Davis because I was doing very well often find people from close okay television and uh I didn't have a clue ... to that point\nReally silly and and how does it work for you if you just see a little bit of someone's face like the un ears sticking out from the cap for instance or or an eyebrow is that enough\nIt leaves you'd be amazed last year and a lot of people from the back of the head from above who's but those are\nThe very strange ability but when it when it comes off you are very excited the thing is every single time I look a fight sucking up into the conversation on now is someone is going to be in a row style and you'll find well it's a rock star Donald ... put me in a room full of people and pitches last amazing\nYou like that I Love it and those who prepping all just a it's not a burden so in other words I see\nAnd those who prepping all just a it's not a burden so in other words I see thousands of faces everyday to I wouldn't want to remember each of the details that I pick up\nIt can be a burden speak on it because you could be walking down the street and someone would walk into what would you they might smile she think oh I Know that person because you recognize the face but you don't actually know them ... and then like a a don't we know you if the problem is because if you will in the same area coughed and you'll see the fights you recognize that the vice\nHuh do you have to commit that face or the details of the face to memory or is it involuntary\nIs involuntary um you don't really have to try you can just be walking down the street you'll see that face sign many times I recognized them years later\nAnd you didn't know this until you were working with the police as a as a grown man it wasn't something that you recognize when you were a kid that oh my gosh I've got this strange talent\nNot us to talk to the correct or did not have a clue awful that everybody could do to yourself though it was a natural but let's see if everyone and so I didn't have a clue but the second ... found out what a super recognize off doing the test with ... ... that's ...\nHuh you are as you say took these skills to your police work and let's talk about this case of the Russian spy poisoning or insult very of course you were not involved in this investigation but take us inside that department how would this have played out behind the scenes\nSite firstly I Know the are the guys dealing with it would've been very excited because the whole point is they're going to get lots of footage to view and ... that's a very exciting thing because that gives us time to review the CCTV would never go look for certain people or if not with ... people from the footage\nSo would use many different techniques like links to attend is ...\nSo many different techniques like links to his identification Web I Would take time for the footage until we notice and normally scientists and appearing mostly because of a super recognizes were recognized that person that got some memory than if we see that person to get enough of it if the ... and then we can start seeing is that the person we're looking full\nNow London as you well know is one of the most surveilled cities in the world there's some estimates that there is something like a million CCTV cameras capturing hours and hours of footage every single day of the year how important is that trove of that evidence for you is a detective in ... in that unit\nI think is absolutely brilliant it's estimated about one point five billion cameras now in London and I think is absolutely marvelous because\nBeing on that said ... which I was we used to get so much CCTV come fruits wasps\nAre pictures of suspects oath I Would always look into the suspects sometimes we'll have to look for the victims were looking for missing persons and having all that say CCTV available to you where do you help solve ... fun people will will kind of cases did you crack a really good one was there was a male who would want to Scotland Yard ... most wanted\nAnd he was believed to be out of the country of the time so I was in London and I've seen a ... just a suspect I'd never met them before about seeing a picture of them will solve going around in the ... you give me ... we lost at the same\nAnd he'd been stopped several times of the police officers who hadn't recognizing the on London's most wanted but luckily ... cops um when we took it back for fingerprinted it comes down to the same\nPeople probably shocked when you tell them how you found them\nDid get ... often as we even had one guy right from prison\nWe did get actual often we even had one guy right from prison and I can't believe you me for that one sided I ah like the ... is a very unique skill\nWow Josh Davis let's bring you in again from the University of Greenwich what does the science say about how this works\nThe science says we think that she sort of a night we think that super recognizes a less than one percent of the population very very few people have this ability\nWe found some very small differences in the way that their brains function and I think that's the sort of direction that the research may be going and future\nIs it a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nWe think it's a different function is it's quite an interesting question that because people have done research on a world champion soup and memorize is who passed can count hundreds of ... something like this\nAnd when they tested that face recognition ability they found that they would not very good at all on the other hand super recognizes seemed to have average IQ they seem to be average at recognizing other types of objects recognizing sort of streams of numbers in words and things like that\nSo it does seem as though it's a unique skill that he's a specific to faces\nWould there be an evolutionary reason why humans might develop a skill like this\nNot in fact almost the opposite because as you could imagine and ... and sort of pre history people lived in very very small communities needing to know a large number of faces wouldn't being very necessary\nA large number of faces wouldn't being very necessary so so that's the sort of strange situation as far as the science is concerned it may be the what's happened is the policy of the brain associates it with other\nAspects of object recognition as somehow change slightly to in these super recognizes to become very very good at face recognition but that's a hypothesis ... the sons definitely well look\nComputers can be trained to recognize faces as well how how does the human brain compare to what artificial intelligence can do\nLike I said with very very good high quality images computers are operating at about the same level as an average human being super recognizes a still better than the best computers in the world\nBut we low quality images which most CCTV footage is a human beings still beat to computers\nI think in the future will what the situation has gotten so bad it's the best algorithms working with the best humans to super recognizes to make the most accurate identity decisions\nWhat are the limitations that people like Kenny have\nAs a human being leads to sleep unlike you to uh we get tied fatigue there must be limits to how many images and how many people Kenny can say I'm big before before he does get fatigue so that's one limitation of humans\nWas really I think ... impressive about Kenny scale is he's ability to rule out the huge number of face\nRule out the huge number of faces the Hindus and they'll say ... to him because obviously when they're searching through CCTV footage for ... you know for a suspect Fritz ... most of the time they're actually looking at face these people they're not interested in vaccines ... asleep recognize that can do\nIs Josh I Know you've worked with Scotland Yard in the past uh we know they're recruiting people like Kenny from within the force to be tested for this skill but but what about other places\nFunding for

to use the body's immune system to attack cancer Allison is the chair of immunology and executive director of the immunotherapy platform\nAt the University of Texas empty Anderson Cancer center and joining us now is Dr Peter pastors who is president of empty Anderson Dr ... welcome and congrats to you and your colleague on winning a Nobel Prize\nThis is fantastic news of course for Jim for MBR sin but most importantly for cancer patients around the world will tell us a little bit about\nJames Allison's work in immune therapy to attack cancer\nDr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his uh research career to us\nWell Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and his uh maintenance I was to understand how to block a protein on T cells\nThat acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably at Dr level [laughter] well\nIn our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells\nAnd those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or cause autoimmune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Allison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what has that meant for cancer treatment in general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call them you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery chemotherapy and radiation\nIn creating an entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments are sometimes used in isolation alone\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nI I Do believe that this will lead to insights and two opportunities to see this as a ...\nThis will lead to insides and two opportunities to see this as a soul form of tree mad and allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer what\nKind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular results including patients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated\nBy the drug that gyms team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond these are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nGenes Allison started his career at ... or send in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nA the Andy Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving you a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how hopeful are you about that\nDie of cancer this year how hopeful argue about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combinations of targeted therapy immunotherapy and the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer affect\nThis change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations that are heralded in today's a Nobel Prize awards really open up avenues that create great opportunities for cancer patients in the future\nIs Dr Peter ... the president of the University of Texas Andy Anderson Cancer Center thank you so much and again congratulations thank you so much\nWell now to Spain and the city of punting ... population eighty thousand where you're more likely to hear chirping birds than honking horns\nThat's because much of the city is now car free no parking spaces no traffic lights and in Ninety seven percent cut in auto traffic since Nineteen Ninety nine freelance journalist Stephen virgin wrote about this he joined us on Skype from Barcelona welcome\nHigh and did they ban cars entirely in ...\nWell they they ban them from the initially from the historic part of the city the medieval city which is about three hundred thousand square majors and then they extended that to a slightly bigger\nA area which is sort of the the Eighteen Nineteen century part of the city so the city center is calm free and then it it's it's ringing to buy a areas where you can drive and also where there are a lot of places to park and how's that working out\nUm it's when you know very well I think you know like most\nSo where there are a lot of places to park and how's that working out\nUm it's working out very well I think you know like most of these things that was a lot of resistance or people you know associate having cause with their\nPersonal liberty um but I spoke to lots of people while I was there and I couldn't find anyone who criticize that even though you know this is a part of Spain where it tends to rain quite a lot that's on the Atlantic side of Spain um people tend to get into their cars whenever it's raining and\nLots of people said to me that just change their habits are they\nWhat about emergency vehicles police fire ambulance as\nWell you know all all of them can get to sit there and they're also taxes you know the rule was is quite strange to me the mayor said to me if you want to get married and the old city the bride and groom can come in a car but everyone else walks\nWhat about businesses or are they happy with this because you would think that many people would want to drive to get to a ... shop or a restaurant where they want to go\nWell that was you know that was a business where I was opposed to it exactly on that basis although in these old says she's just very very difficult to park so the reality is in fact businesses survive better\nThan in some small towns or where you know they still allow cause a pony because it's just simply nicer to walk around the other thing is that the than the than he is our T's combined the policy of banning cars were those also banning\nThe building of big shopping centers on the outskirts of town which ten destroy small businesses within the town\nSo you spoke with the mayor of punted ... what did he say about why he wanted to do this\nWell you have you know he basically said that the old city was effectively a dumb thought it was a that people didn't like going now that it was full of abandoned cars that were on drugs and he and within the first month of come into office basically\nIt was full of abandoned cars that were a lot of drugs and he and within the first month of come into office basically he cleaned it up and buying cars which is you know clearly something you know he said he'd been you know has been researching into those for some time before he took office\nAnd I think partly because he doesn't swiftly was you know that was kind of a fait accompli\nWhat about CEO to emissions or what happened to pollution as a result of this\nWill pollution according to their statistics went down within the city center by about Seventy percent or accidents went down a\n... to ... uh to almost zero and I think in the past four or five years\nIt's been zero of either either people injured or killed so you know these are significant gains obviously you know it's also you know general game for people's health and people walk or people cycle I'm you know this is what everyone is to some extent aiming for in cities\nNow punting they dress a small city many people probably haven't even heard of it but there is a larger city in Spain

maybe day five Mitch McConnell really can't do that until Wednesday at the earliest\nThe question is if he goes ahead before the FBI investigation is complete\nIs he interrupting disagreement with Jeff Flake Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nOr if they they are OK with that and they're like yes okay this is satisfied it hasn't been a week that's fine let's go ahead\nThen everybody a you know is is cool with that that's fine but if if the he's perceived as jumping the gun that's a problem that could be viewed as a violation of the agreement ... and you know just like got a lot of criticism from some conservatives over the weekend or who you know criticized him for saying that you know he was delaying all this\nThey wouldn't have a chance of getting the votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh were not for Jeff Flake they're basically sitting right now about forty nine years\nAnd with this deal they could potentially get Collins potentially get Murkowski maybe Joe Manchin a Democrat from West Virginia\nMaybe Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat from North Dakota maybe get his highest fifty three days but otherwise they're stuck at forty nine so they can't move too quickly in the Senate they have to\nBe careful that President says he wants what Senate leadership wants to the question is what does Senate leadership one\nLeadership wants to the question is what does Senate leadership want I mean who is on that list of people that will be interviewed by the FBI\nAnd that's the question you know what does columns want what does Murkowski one that is a big unknown and that's why you know Senate timing around here is not exactly Swiss when they tell you that something is going to happen seven days from now or six days from now usually happens in about eight or nine maybe ten\nUh the only thing I Do know is that once that clock starts to run ... once McConnell files cloture to end debate that will take that's a finite period about four to five days at the most\nDies down or you can also college for four or five eight six Seventy eight eighty seven eight for four five six seven eight eight seven and thank you\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are

independence one year after a historic referendum\nWhich the Spanish government called illegal an invalid in fact the government tried to stop the election from even happening police fought with voters as they cast their ballots on October first twenty Seventeen\nJoining us now is the BBC's gabbing lead he's in a busy square in downtown Barcelona where there was a moment of silence at noon local time to mark the anniversary of the boat a gab and tell us more about what's happening there today\nWas the what what we're seeing has become sort of the most effective tools of independence movement which is a physical numbers that the colors on the streets that that the flags fiesta allotted a flag of independence and there are people who own around me hundreds of mainly young independence\nAround me up hundreds of mainly young independence activists who have been sleeping outside the\nCapital and politicians saying that for the next few weeks or months later to try to protect the general states have the government the regional governments until they declare independence so they could be here for some time well let's hear from one of the activities that you spoke with this is a man named Roger Espanol who was shot by police\nIndy I he was actually he was blinded by a rubber bullet last October first and you asked him what has been achieved by the referendum the friends that\nWas the first of all do and\nI'm sure we're going to make it yes\nEven if we're going to have the political power in our\nGabbing to these protestors believe they still have a shot at independence\nSome of them do one of the grassroots group called a CD onto the campaign for Democratic Republic who this morning touch 'em some of the major ... routines about surviving a stop to all the traffic they they have managed to break into the train stations to high speed train running from\nOne of the major cities to fulfill their activities in the new regional presidents and uncle Kim Toyota\nHas said today that base activity is working keep pushing it so I think this will be seen as provoke us have certainly by the main government in Spain and go down saying\nThe socialist government to the prime minister Petro Sanchez there is no chance of ever a referendum on independence it's against the constitution but they could have greater autonomy and last night I put that to\nThe spokesperson for the cattle and separatist government here\nAnd to join the PKK he said to me categorically no and they will continue he said\nAccept disobedience like be illegal referendum if they don't get an independence choice and he\nSaid when and how he said not now I'm telling you will do something well you know we should point out that their recent polls that say that people in the region are split on the issue so there are many people that you've been speaking to still want independence and there are those who\nDo not um how how divided in Catalonia [noise]\nWell I think that's a fascinating thing because it in the in the year since we had him really pivotal moment the polls hasn't changed it's divided fifty fifty and I think that's the interesting thing when a loss of the analysts who look at the situation now they believe\nThe wrong thing this increased it is the bitterness between both sides and that is that you nailed it divided front gel sense it could very easily spark off again on the streets\nBut to be received Kevin ... speaking with us from the streets of downtown Barcelona Gavin thanks so much for your time we do appreciate\nKnow Mm Mm\nMm\nWell now that we're into fall and the weather's a little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy guns does here to warm up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved to make I Know and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spent a week after week in the studio telling you\nHow simple it is to make various foods and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it isn't solved deep frying at home is completely\nChicken it is involved keep frying at home is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire started to fire but you want to hear my first step yeah I use a walk\nWalk the ideal shape\nFor holding the oil knows flattering it's got the high sides you want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a mom and her because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil you put that their own or in the hot oil right so I have my walk\nI also use a cast iron skillet okay ad\nAbout an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Crisco you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix\nAnd I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there I can constantly see why it's getting close to four hundred or oh no no it's down to two hundred\nAnd I am always adjusting to keep it around three twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some butter led fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken American so I can listen to that crunch alright would be good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good butter milk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender rises chicken it at some of that is ... flavor but it also does tend to rise the chicken\nI take it out and then I dusted well in a combination of\nI take it out and then I dusted well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little suspects you see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's kind of great texture and then I fry it up and\nHere's another track okay to go if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the best pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for a different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there\nYou're not going over or under cook it now you got a little bit of money here in some lemon so I didn't do so you would yeah I don't I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the fatty and this of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey adds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken\nFried chicken and what's right with the hunting isn't the hunting has really brings out the sweet flavor that's there\nBut it's subtle and a kind of pulls it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left over oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answer the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end\nAnd was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having not greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's okay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean\nVersion and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go ... and\nSoy sauce ginger little catch up sesame and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nThen you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried\nOh so you fry it you cool it down and they might try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy knows that's just for ... is it yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra ...\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate I similar it down again the chili paste the ginger and\nI spread that on the chicken and Dustin with sesame seeds and I don't know what do you think it's delicious and and by the way I sent well and and I remember we talked to David Chang chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history a involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans\nI've also eaten at past schools in Atlanta which is where Martin Luther king used to go and how it is fried chicken\nBack in the day so there's a lot of history lots of history and David ... did a whole series for Netflix about right did a whole episode on fried chicken and what ... the big takeaway is that it's eaten all over the world but I did talk to Michael ... he is the author of the cooking gene which won some James Beard awards he\nSaid fried chicken goes back deep into the middle ages in Africa during the slave trade it's emblematic of the afro krill innovation that gets\nIt's emblematic of the afro krill innovation that gets co opted time and time again and he goes on to talk about how it's southern and the soul identities come right out of this collision\nJoined us as we're a special one hour program from our partner station KNPR in Las Vegas\nComing up at two o'clock right here on\nFrom our partner station KNPR in Las Vegas [noise] coming up at two o'clock right here on occasion\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

recently found that in several rural and suburban areas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty twelve and twenty Seventeen\nAnd ... why the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years across the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening at a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming\nWell it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington one of the districts trying to figure all this out currently welcome yeah thank you for having me those numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing there appears county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years two years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have\nJust this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why\n[noise] yeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but\nI I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom we never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened um there's many different factors that are leaving these family is just on the edge of becoming homeless and\nReally it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nNo you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing a an issue where people are getting priced out of a of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community as what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or as cheap as they can\nA lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or as cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and\nLike I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath them\nAnd it's a symptom of a good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm\nFirst off there are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go with out until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every\nDay and you notice that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nIt's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter]\nBecause they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it I go out in my community and I do drive by is to go to address that they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lot of times I\nJust go out to the house and cold and knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers are experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho they've got the highest number of homeless students they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska\nThis used in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause\nA each one of these places or something different\nIt's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different\nEmployment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with um just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families it's like we're not keeping up with the need so what kind of help where you get it [noise]\nWe um Bethel school district is not connected to a city title so it's very difficult to\nHave the resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide 'em funding and donations\nI Believe vessel we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families 'cause we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them clothing that they need some time to be these are ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we um send food packs home with every homeless students on Fridays so they have food for the week\n... where we um send food packs home with every homeless students on Fridays so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported but it's it's like a band aid to every crisis it's happening\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and so we got is not is not going to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team at Bethel it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help\nThe big picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness in school or eighty seven percent more likely\nTo drop out of high school and as you well know then becomes the cycle of poverty you see this every day and your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle with the class work\nIt's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students\nUm their self worth and their self value and what they believe they're capable of doing is so low that it the bill ... them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be\nI'll just give you an example I had one young man I was working with and he had no self value\nCould care less about doing his school and I had asked him I said what do you want to do what do you want to be when you grow up and he's like I don't know\nHis probably just end up like my parents and be on the streets and I'm like no you can be you can be something different I said what do you enjoy so after a couple meetings with him over the next week um\nDifferent I said what do you enjoy so after a couple meetings with him over the next week um I had discovered they loved animals so it was simple as hooking him up to a veterinarian it took they took the young man under his wings and started showing them the ropes of\nWhat education you need to become a veterinarian doctor and here why don't you come after school and help on tearing cleaned the kennels for me and do this it gave that boy purpose to have a hope in a dream after high school
