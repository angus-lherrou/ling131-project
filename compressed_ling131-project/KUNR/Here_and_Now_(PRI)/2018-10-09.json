I always say you have a new reds thousands of government documents about this what did you learn from them about how the citizenship question came up out in the first place\nAbout how the citizenship question came up out in the first place\n[noise] all these documents were part release in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question and I really key document is an internal memo written by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who as commerce secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty senses\nAnd it didn't he says that he initially thought about adding a citizenship question to the twenty twenty cents is as soon as shortly after he became ... the Senate confirmed him as the commerce secretary so this would be late February of twenty Seventeen\nAnd then a over those months he\nWorked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the census and this is a question that asks is this person a citizen of the United states\nIt's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been a there's been a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey that's now known as the American Community Survey\nWhat reasons then does the administration gave her why it doesn't want secretary Ross to testify about it at least once a thing about its reasons\n[noise] well the Justice Department or which is representing a commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and the Trump Administration these lawsuits\nTheir attorneys are saying that the judges should\nDecide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that have been released as part of the lawsuits and not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intend his mindset but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens\nThat's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed they say they really want to a better understand exactly why commerce secretary Wilbur Ross wants to add this question because the Trump Administration has said\nThey wanted to add to because of the voting rights act and he wanted responses from a citizenship question to better enforced section to the voting rights act which has protections against discrimination of racial and language minorities are essentially to make sure that those groups have the right to vote\n'em that the law the federal government has relied on other\nAnother kind of citizenship data from the American Community Survey of 'em and uh the Trump initiation says that data is not enough is not accurate enough\nUm and it needs it on the descending on the twenty twenty cents as\nPlaintiffs are very skeptical of that and they're concerned that there are other other motives here involved or one of the internal memos or one of the emails released as part of the lawsuits include\nA communication between a Kris Kobach the current Republican gubernatorial candidates as well as the former vice chair of President Trump's now defunct\nCommission on voter fraud he wrote to Wilbur Ross are trying to lobby Wilbur Ross addict citizenship question and his concern was that undocumented unauthorized immigrants are counted in census numbers used to divide up\nThe congressional seats are among the states after the census\nOf this comes at a really pivotal time for the Census Bureau itself or the Senate has not yet confirmed President Trump's new appointee to lead the agency or the Twenty one twenty cents as it's going to be the first to be conducted in part on line so with all of that going on\nThis is going to be the first to be conducted in part on line so with all of that going on how prepared is the Census Bureau for what does a massive undertaking\nOr the uh the Census Bureau has really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross edible at stay or will it go and we probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really pushing up against a deadline that the Census Bureau spacing of what to exactly prints on the forms are this will be the first online census but paper will play an important part for live households that may not be comfortable or don't have access to Internet and so they will need paper and so this is a really big question right now and that hopefully the lawsuits will resolve\nA from the Census Bureau perspective now the question will they the sense of being able to hire enough workers to collect them or information from households around the country\nOkay thank you NPR national correspondent ... thanks a lot\nYou're welcome the anonymous British graffiti artist

time no one knew that there was shredded built into the frame you can imagine the shock and horror no interest in that ... everyone's eyes are not painting of that time\nAnd for some people listening

known as the ... of the uh swelled and he's a basic he's an enormous English artist he's a street and graffiti artists that he kind of gets name as a political artist as well I'm kind of showed up on the scene by the nineties um\nAnd he's black originally highlights the loss of a corruption and inequality and society but he did it in a very humorous way nowadays it's humid slightly less and he takes them a series pain in his walk and as you say he's never been on mosques that there are\nHundreds of theories as to who he could be um and we still didn't name has a big theory that he was in the ... when the painting the shredded\nWow so let's talk about some of the theories then what do you know because there are people who who think they've seen him at work do we wouldn't have been installations on a wall somewhere or enlarged but you know we don't know who he is so um what are some of the theories about about who this ... this mysterious artist might be\nThey have ranged from him being a painter and decorate to another graffiti artist named king ... and people say he's Damian Hess people even say that you know banks he may well be a woman and there's another theory that he's and not just one pass any\nAnother theory that he's and not just one person he is a collection of artists it's just because he's such a a an icon of mystery the the theories range from what could potentially be the trees to something very outrageous and I think there was a bond that they said he was the from mine if the bonds\nAnd because every time that bond performed in the late ... see the poll pop\nThe guy had to come out and say um it's definitely not me I have a creative bone in my\n... [noise] what what do you think he was trying to say by Schrodinger painted\nIn my opinion and I think he's trying to say that his wife is not for sale it's not the first time his what has gone up for sale um and it's something that has been done without his consent\nThis time I had to see I I this is just my personal opinion on the opinion that certain people I ... that the painting and the shredding if the painting was away at him saying my ... for one pass and it's for everybody and because this painting you know eat it shut it off to\nThe humble wet and it was a way of him saying they swap doesn't belong to anybody he never paints inevitable his graffiti odds in a place that\nCan belong to one pass and he does in public spaces he does than in places where it would be very difficult to remove them or anybody to claim that that all walk and I think not what he did he wants his message and he wants his\nWhat to be for everybody rather than ... take ownership is at other theories I've had a he wants his ... to have a great ...\nThe times I've had that he wants his wife to be priceless\nOther times I've had that he wants his wife to be priceless that could be it could be a number of things and and my personal opinion is that he just doesn't want anyone to end his message\nNow one of the questions people are asking is how do you hide a shredder inside a picture frame without anybody noticed the auction house was in on this\n... and because he has ...

oh good afternoon Peter I wish it was better circumstances that we are talking but good afternoon yeah and what are those circumstances and a lot has changed in the last twenty four hours and so it has it has and let me get right to the point about something this you know when we talk about hurricanes and we've talked a lot about several in the last two or three years\nUh we always prepare for what could be the reasonable worst case scenario this one more than Florence I think a potentially it could be a a worst case scenario or it could achieve that status for some locations in the panhandle of Florida I say that with the most\nStraightforward tone and my voice as possible uh this hurricane is continuing to strengthen it could have winds of one hundred twenty five miles per hour at landfall near Panama City or just to the east\nAnd we are talking about potentially a catastrophic storm surge event and some of the coastline that's the most vulnerable in Florida to a storm surge stretching all the way through Appalachia bay the big band and all the way over to the nature coast\nA close to cedar key So Peter I Can't stress enough you know Harvey was an extreme event for in terms of its rain Florence was also an extreme event in terms of its rain this one has the potential to also be an extreme event for wind as it comes ashore tomorrow let's talk about that storm surge\nYou mentioned at the geography of Florida and the Florida Panhandle they're locals call it the Big Bend area what is the geography have to do with how bad that storm surge could be\nWell two things are really working against a are working to enhance the surge in that area but get shallow shelf waters so think of a\nA bath tub being pretty deep it's pretty hard to to you know splashing water out of a bath tub because it's so deep I didn't think of a you know something that's a little more shallow or the water can easily move out of it and the winds are going to\nSomething that's a

entire state of Alabama is under an emergency declaration and it could this storm could eventually track over the Carolinas which of course we're still cleaning up after Hurricane Florence ... what are you watching for outside of the Florida Panhandle\nWell we just a touch base with our partners in South Carolina 'cause we provide weather coverage for them as well and they're preparing for\nUh some flooding from this it's going to the storm's going to be moving in a fast enough pace but any water right now in eastern portions of South Carolina and southern portions in North Carolina is bad

Justin Paul hello there even ... hello\nBench I understand that this is all based on something that happened in your high school\nIt's not directly based on something that happened in my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well\nAnd he passed away and everyone in the school community after his death really began to sort of claim that they were closer with him than they actually were a myself included and I was sort of struck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how\nSimilar phenomenon like a\nOur generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular feels the need to kind of ...\nWhy our generation in particular feels the need to kind of public we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just\nGets up every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself deer Evan Hansen you know kind of telling himself about how he's going to have a good day\nAnd what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmates but he presented kind of a bully he finds one of the letters takes at home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your Evan Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for Evan Hansing kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Stevenson\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with the story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also about the people around him are shields by the story as well I um she feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who of course is and I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear Evans mother a struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they can\n\nJust how you were able to get the feeling the new song [noise] what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters\nYou know it's true or something that we talked about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was you know how do you take the would become a sort of temple moments in the musical how do you take that in translated into a book\nIt is an interesting process of how do you get inside a character's head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as as a novel because\nThe book allows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way that a song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we want to just to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow really any a sweaty palms this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... and really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel [laughter] yes lots of ... students were the ends in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In ... first monologue and the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say Evan also had sweaty hand\nRight he's trying to will in his hands not to be sweaty but by even thinking about them being sweaty they're becoming more sweaty\nNot to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being sweaty hair becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before there but I felt like I knew how to do this or emotionally I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to heaven and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you Erica I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nFisher um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know I'm just the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nThat we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of theirs and and the mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's the him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all you know I'm darkness\nWe don't want to get anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out it's a crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYeah this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to\nA tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about counter but do you really want to know more about countered you want to imagine more about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us that it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for our times of what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media ... and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know\nWhat can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nBut a bench pass it and I just didn't Paul I understand that while you debated what to do how much to do more in a book than you did in the musical your fans we're already doing it than fiction they were they were writing about Evan Connor what might happen\nThis is Justin you know that that was something that was inspiring to us in terms of doing the novel adaptation was\nSeeing that there were a fence around the country around the world who had never seen the show maybe they listen to the cast album or read watched a clip on line or something and\nThey were beginning to create their own stories with these characters and interactions that might have been between evident Connor and and I'm a particular curiosity about Connor which is you know partially what inspired us people wanting to engage with these characters and that's what gave us ...\nUs people wanting to engage with these characters and that's what gave us the confidence to do this and the first place\nIt is a conversation starter for families you know moms can see elements of their kids that their kids won't talk about you know out loud and and and kids will see elements of their parents said that humanize them and ultimately it's really about how we relate to our family members how we hide ugly truth about ourselves\nIt's twelve forty four twenty minutes away from BBC News that we're hearing now continue [noise]\nWe're twenty

and children mostly from Syria Iraq and Africa have arrived in Spain Italy and Greece this year every day more than one hundred people arrive on the Greek island of Lesbos\nThe first faces they see are those of humanitarian aid workers to help them reach the shore clothing and food and health care and temporary shelter\nAid workers the trauma up close nearly every day for months and that takes a toll they have high levels of depression exhaustion and even pi TST that can last for years\nNow the George Washington university global mental health program is drawn up a version of the Hippocratic Oath to address the problem\nThe ancient originated increase it calls for new physicians to swear to abide by ethical standards Philip can deal is is one of the doctors behind this new version\nStill the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mistress\nOf caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits keeping confidences that continue to this day\n... professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training that we were doing\nSo we were eager to that people take care of their team take care of themselves recognizing that there was a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams\nThey have to make sure that they stay within their areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a Syrian section on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult uh in in desperate\nAs you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to have I Can't\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work to do\nSomething that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point uh our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying\nThat it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that we're going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\nOne of the things that you and your colleagues had noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores of Greece a pretty high margin is quite community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've\nBeen impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more western or European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa the middle east\nSo we learned that many of them\nHad grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange with populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the ah follows me or not they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seemed to have an immigrant story they had married someone from outside Greece these ... workers you talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes on a a shared a humanitarian motivation\nJust have one more question um I have no need for quite some time and I know you're as you said Greek American you go to Greece quite often\nAs you said Greek American you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for I mean personally what is like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned here in the states and to get back to the origins of my family's migration\nIn the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two and to be able to go back\nAnd offer what our cat we were just there in September [noise] talking to folks in so long ago and from above the work that we do and a recruiting help from the Greek psychiatric community so being able to collaborate in this way has been both professionally I'm personally fulfilling\nPhilippine deal is thank you thank you Lisa\nThat's Dr Phil ... who is part of the George Washington global mental health program that's drawn up the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian aid workers\nBack to the U.S now and a story from the American west walk through forests of that region and you're likely to see centuries old pine and cedar trees\nThat have had their bark peeled off in a special way as un sees ray Ellen ... reports archaeologist don't know why ancient tribes peeled some of the bark away and they're running out of time to solve the mystery\nTen CEO

for the southern you Indian tribe these special ponderosa pines are scattered across the Rocky Mountain region and they all have something in common a big chunk of bark missing from one side peeled away by people sometime in the last few hundred years\nDoes Israel\nAt places a footprint on the landscape as you people as a tribe\nThere are a bunch of them here on the edge of a meadow south of the San Juan mountains\nHome they're right there\nArchaeologist mark Mitchell walks up to in our old tree about as wide across as to people it's thick red bark is curling into reclaiming exposed area that looks a lot like a telephone pole\nWe're looking at a place where the native peoples of a movie out of there\nHe says they did it to get to a spongy white material inside called ...\nSome people describe it as a little astringent I think it tastes kind of coconut\nMitchell is a research director for a nonprofit archeology organization called the ... cultural research group they teamed up with the forest service to study trees like this one volunteers start taking measurements sodas one person started screwing a hollow toll into the trees as thin as a drinking straw area\n\nSample will give a date for when the peel happened or but there are a lot of questions about these ... trees yes\nPerfect there are a lot of questions about these peeled trees\nYes there are a one of the biggest questions we have is what precisely was the purpose of the floor window it's edible\nBut he says where people eating it because it was a delicacy or because they were starving within medicine or part of a special occasion Julie Coleman wonders if these trees might reveal patterns about how tribes like the you were moving across the landscape she's an archaeologist with the San Juan national forest\nGPS unit get point pots and each tree and then hopefully we'll see a pattern and you might show trails and all the ways\nThat mark Mitchell says they're running out of time to study the peeled trees\nWe feel like the clock is ticking now it's been taking for a while but we really feel the urgency of now\nDrought could kill these trees or in expanding beetle infestation could cripple them with the fungus called blue stain or wildfires could erase them\nSome of the big fires that we've had in Colorado in the last five or six years have taken some of the streets we know that\nBut time could also get them some of these trees could be five hundred years old like this one\nOh wow that is cool\nIs neat that is amazing I was hoping we would find all of these\nFor this treat people
