I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's start looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were saying what people are we're even seeing our impact\nOn this planet\nSo we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people said we're always talking about stars riding but it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was a day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this then shimmering layer of light that is our atmosphere it's this planet that warms us in cools us and enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and then while we're connected to the greater universe which I'm very much felt I felt like I Belong to this\nFirst which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet and we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nSo it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change [noise] well\nI Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because here's the thing\nToday we have these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected than we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we wasted and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster\nWe really care about each other but that carried only happens when we're come face to face that\nI can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to the sky something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of of human about astronaut like you and think that you have a different view of\nAnd think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you now as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have\nNo I actually have\nA view of earth that I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up\nAnd and imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable it felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way\nWe were calling the ... that we have that's completely free we're calling it\nA ... ... is a sky selfie and that sort of like our connection between the sky you know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here now dot org and learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of uh this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions why we have you because you you were in space you're the principle of the one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth in the next hundred years\n[noise] so let's I when I hear your starship is about making sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of\nOf governance in terms of you know\nIt is in terms of you know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to send right right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet welding counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it is really change fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form in what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship\nAnd the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out ... as a crew how to live together that means that we don't foul our planet through\nPollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happens to other people that we understand that we have to live on this planet in our behavior makes a difference [noise]\nThird now are a number or a small number but a number of African American women who have gone to dispose\nYou'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you\nWhat does that mean to you [noise] so ... it was really interesting to me because not only was the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color in the entire world to go up into space and\nIt's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time I got old enough to go into space that I Would be the first anything [laughter] because I would've thought that we would have had lots and lots of other people going up\nBut being that being the the first one was called her in the world is going to say what I realized that my responsibility is including other people\nBoth in yes being space explorers whether it's being the the rocket scientist to suit technicians you know are being a crew members to involve them in space exploration\nYet even as important is making sure that we understand that individuals on this planet have a right to be involved with space exploration that they understand the impact\nOf this technology and how profound it can be to help us build a better world do you want to go back into space again [noise] [noise] well you know what we're in space right now\nC O on your smartphone and K.

power could be out for weeks and we're learning how far inland the storm reached some of the Tadic Rodney and Jason is emergency management director in Jackson County Florida he's in Mariana\nWhere there was three deaths\nAnd Rodney a year in our north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened where you are\nWhere there were three ... and ... a year in our north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened when you are\nRight we we took a direct hit the when it hit us it was ... at a high cat threes low cat for which is somewhat unusual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm although a lot of places and people will realize that they're stolen does affect people that deep inland\nAnd when you've got a storm of this magnitude and moving as fast as it did it held together a lot better and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impact included you land and you're home run hit\nYes it was it was a heavily damaged and pretty much it it it is destroyed the the structure stood the house basically over pressurized and blue part on my roof off and we're hoping to get some some adjusted today\nYou know well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us a thumbnail of what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like a you know I have a I spent Twenty one years in the military and it it's the damage is it just off the scales bath and buildings down almost every tree has been affected snapped off halfway up and it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that have used to live here and come back so they don't even recognize a town well\nThe county appraiser Carlin he can't tell the Tampa Bay to be in that she's guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of the homes and businesses in the whole county ... county we damage she's using actual an aerial pictures that you sent\nA sense that we ... we had a\nCrew go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plus are completely destroy so you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nOr with Gulf Power spokesperson said this to restore that you're heading to rebuild the entire electrical grid and we understand is a patchwork on city and a cooperative utilities and then after big storms in two thousand five and\nCity and a cooperative utilities\nAnd then after big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were tone do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do I can tell you on a critically they do an unbelievably awesome and difficult job\nAnd they have had very aggressive programs to bring back those trees to upgrade the grid and I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you have done it absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nOh what are some of these issues because I I think we heard in one report that horizon is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does ruin the twin towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood is just they were so much to breed though they could not get back to ensure the propane tanks refill for the generator so the generators stopped and so they were not transmitting\nNow you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to find a study on storm response failed in the state legislature and twenty Seventeen\nDo you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level of emergency convening on what to do going forward\nWe're looking at an infrastructure in this country that is fifty some of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast look at all are critical infrastructure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike asking Romney just briefly um does Iran have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nI I don't know if it was so much climate change\nYou meant that that something is happening because of climate change\nIs she'll which climate change is it is just a natural process that occurs over the years\nYou don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast ... a town\nWiped out and you know every scientist worth their mental saying that uh this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me in my level there's not a course of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I can almost guarantee you this will change the climate of my community and the attitude of those in this area\nWell uh Rodney and reason there in Jackson County and Mariana Florida we wish you the best\nCase thank you very much [noise]\nWell parts of the country are lucky enough to be in Paris season so we want to take a closer look with here now resident Jeff ... who is in the studio Hi Hi Robyn you don't have to say I'm One of those people I Love\nPears I think they are an art form I have ... cookbooks pictures of pairs\nAnd all I Do use them and salads we blue cheese okay well your whole pair world is about to get blown out of the park and I say so I Love writing okay well\nThe most common one that we see in grocery stores is that on Jew or mans you um there is a red and you and then there's also a bright green one which is kind of an egg shape\nThey tend to be soft juicy they're great Rob they hold up to poaching and baking as well and you're going to find as I describe these that\nIt's an incredibly versatile fruit most or all of them can be cooked as well as eaten raw and they are somewhat if not completely interchangeable how dark brown ones that seem to have a tougher skinned okay so that's called an Asian\nDark brown ones that seem to have a tougher skinned okay so that's called an Asian pair and I went up for you right there they are very crunchy very tart sweet also these are best eaten raw to me and Asian pair tastes like\nPair and meeting with a water chestnut and it's got that wonderful crunch and a little bit of juicing is and wonderful and salads wonderful graded also Bartlett another very common for a ride him very sweet red and green as well\nThey are ... they are wonderful texture for poaching what I Love about them is they retain their shape when you cook them\nThere's also boss pairs same deal very earthy flavor and ... parents have any long gated neck which is really fun because when you poach them it has this elegant long to talk about the poached because we have when we did it seems so hard\nI'm really glad you said that because I\nAm going to absolutely show you how wrong you are okay All right here's what I did read ... I peeled the pair but I kept the stem on yeah okay I peeled it okay with me and they can make it ... I took a couple of sugar ... and a couple of white wine and two cups of water and I boil them ...\nI could add a cinnamon stick I could add some fresh ginger to that\nI let it cook down that's called the simple syrup mhm\nI place my naked as you call them pairs into the syrup\nAnd I let them cook for about twenty five to thirty minutes and what happens is the parent releases its Jews into the syrup\nAnd the pair than cooks in this week delicious ginger syrup it can be made well ahead of time it keeps in the syrup\nIt can be made well ahead of time it keeps in the syrup you can eat that for breakfast and you could eat that as part of a salad but you certainly could serve that for dessert you don't need whipped cream it's healthy it's light and I think it's so refreshing\nLine right now but the other thing about Paris is that they swing both ways they're savory and they're also clearly sweet so I made a savory salad that's a little bit different than a normal pear salad I took 'em in this case I Believe I use\nA Bartlett pair my peel did I put a tiny bit of olive oil salt and pepper on it and I roasted it in little wedges and\nThen I have fresh spinach and fall greens\nAnd I put my roasted pear around it and I took some French bread or bad get toasted in thin slices and spread blue cheese on top\nAnd I ... in a little bit of maple syrup so you have crunchy green tart\nPungent from the blue cheese and sweet and voluptuous from the pairs and the phone oh and there's also sun dried cranberries seasonal specialty in the vein of grad okay we have this what is this\nThis is an upside down ... that you probably heard of upside down pineapple cake and it's very similar I used to variety I use comments I use a um\nFor a rally pair which are smallish that means trout in German and it's got a wonderful from heart flavor and then I also use the boss pair so I melted some butter and brown sugar and let that cook\n[noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

Corrine maybe not a household name but some think it should be and that's where we turn for this week's DJ session a ba Corrine edition [noise]\n... is host of plastic mornings on W. I. O. L. in Urbana, Illinois Dick welcome back Jeremy it's great to be back thank you and you wanted us to start with the menu at from the string quintet in eat major this is played by the Smithsonian Chamber Players [noise]\n\n\n[noise] very\nFamiliar tune that this was actually made famous by the Nineteen fifty five movie the lady killers about a group of these that rent an apartment from a widow in London and they say they're a string quartet that just want to use the room to practice or this is a song that they play I've heard this and a lot of movies since that tell us about it\nIf anybody has ever said they haven't heard anything of Luigi ... have in the day throughout his peace and in our time it became famous in the Nineteen fifties in that film but I understand that in the late Nineteen century\nThat they were arrangements that were made this piece went viral and it's time you could say there were range means for\nA Mandel lesions for piano for saxophone for ... choir with a Latin text added so this piece has been popular will before Nineteen fifty five and the fun thing about the lady killers and the use in the film\nThis is a word that's written for a string quartet to violins viola cello was an additional cello no there is a joke about the film it's either an error in the film or it's an additional joking that these crooks pose as a string quintet with an additional viola\nAnd not with a cello so somebody should have been on to this and that those guys are walking around without a second cellist\nYou know the other film that it's in one of my favorites is Ferris pillars day off this is what they play when they go into the fancy restaurant in Chicago I Try to get in [laughter]\nWhether or not supposed to be but it's it's been in a lot uh I Wonder was it actually too\nTo be but it's it's been in a lot uh I Wonder was it actually to another version of the same piece this is the saint Paul chamber orchestra with Bobby McFerrin conducting an on vocals [noise]\n[noise]\n\nYou know when I said Bobby McFerrin on vocals I was waiting to find out what that meant exactly but there you have it he's not singing necessarily but he is a humming along to the to the tin\nBobby McFerrin is being Bobby ... and I think it's a fascinating arrangement other for our time if you like this piece you should know that Luigi ... wrote over a hundred string quintet this is one simple minuet from one quintet so there's a lot more there to explore\nHe was writing these for the younger brother of the Spanish king dome release and while he was doing it he was writing string quartets for royalty and playing the additional channels himself so he was doing this so that he could play along with them and then he would also right\nStream queen tests for depression king who was a cellist so he had a lot of opportunities to write to stream queen tests and string quartets in addition to other cheaper music [noise]\nWhat do we know about what influenced\nAnd the other cheaper music what do we know about what influenced Corrine who influenced him\nWhen he was a cellist early on he learned the cello he also learn singing his father was a double bass player he and his father were playing in orchestras and you realize city couldn't\nMake a living just by being a cello virtuoso that you had to compose music so he began to compose music\nAnd he ends up getting very wealthy patrons who demand a certain kinds of music and that seemed to influence he's writing chamber music rather than say a president at the time\nWell let's get to another offer ... and this is the cello concerto in gene major performed by the Canadian ... orchestra and on her bills ... on the cello dusted by Jean\nWhat the ... or something you have to admire\nThis it's it's a lot of playing and then the can sure does there's a lot of\nIt's it's a lot of playing and then they can sure does there's a lot of virtue wash stick writing as well and I think those two things sort of defined bill Corrine in many ways that he was a virtuoso and wrote\nParts for a cellist in his country or does and he's also known for having been gifted in writing melodies kind of wonder if he if he would have ever written more than a couple of operas that he wrote late in his life whether he would have been a great opera composer but here we get both sides of them in a in the cello concerto is\nOkay now to one of his symphonies this is the symphony number three in gene major played by the London Mozart players [noise]\nOr\n\n\nOne of the things that I hear they're at that this was obviously recorded in a big hall or which I Love that you can tell that by listening there but what do you hear that tells you something is a book or in a piece\nYou can hear again this gift for metal and he's writing this in a symphony heightened was writing symphonies at the time it's been suggested that book read was sued detail oriented that maybe he didn't have\nAn ear for the architecture of a full symphony or if it's funny there's a contemporary book greedy violinist composer ... ...\nTemporary book greedy violinist composer ... ... and his famous lined\nThat if the almighty wish to speak through music it would be that of heightened if the almighty wish to listen to music we'd be data book read and book really had that gift for melody and had the gift for the detail and you can hear that just in this a portion of the symphony number three by ... why\nDo you think then that he is not as well known as Mozart Beethoven Chopin Tchaikovsky and others\nIt could be that most of his music is cheaper music\nAnd I would say that the appeal of chamber music is not as great as see the appeal\nFor orchestral music and it's not that he didn't write orchestral music and I think it's becoming a little bit better known but I think compared to those other composers or there isn't as much of it I think that's one of the reasons why it's not as popular in our time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Reno", "day": "18"}
