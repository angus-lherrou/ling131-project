in Georgia and for some the danger is not over here's FEMA administrator Brock Long\nRight now the focus is truly on life safety uh and making sure that uh we're helping people who may be trapped and are pushing through and doing damage just as much to make sure that we fully understand where we need to coordinate our response efforts\nJoining us now is Jeff Hoffman chief meteorologist with the Florida public radio emergency network Jeff whereas Michael today\nA Jeremy Michael's moving into the uh North Carolina region it has quickly moved to South Carolina this morning and over the next few hours from the heaviest rain from this will be near the Raleigh Durham area Fayetteville Greenville North Carolina the center of that storm passing near Charlotte still a tropical storm in likely will stay officially a tropical storm all the way to the coast there at the mid Atlantic states\nAh with wins in the forty to fifty miles per hour range and some heavy rain\nWell and as Michael passes over the Carolinas this is the area that was already hit by Hurricane Florence what are the concerns there\nThe heaviest rain from that thankfully is a a little more located further inland end to the mid stated upstate region still very heavy rain flash flooding concern big time in the hill country but it is moving quickly us so Jeremy that it's going to mitigate the flood risk they're still going to be some runoff rivers that were of course are at their craft\nMitigate the flood rest they're still going to be some runoff rivers that were of course are at their ... a week or so ago from Florence have come back down they may come back up a a bad but we're avoiding an extreme event in the Carolinas because it's moving quickly\nAnd what about further up in the northeast\nWell we have to watch out for tornadoes there's a tornado watch in effect for eastern portions of North Carolina southeastern portions of Virginia 'til nine o'clock tonight I Believe\nAnd do that risk will continue up into uh uh the Delmarva area this will become a nor'easter so there's going to be some coastal impact in New England or the center of this though should stay just offshore but I certainly this will be a far reaching storm all the way up into the coastal regions of New York in Massachusetts and up in the main even\nA Michael at its strongest point was a category for hurricane with a hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds very close to a category five this is the same a wind speed that we saw with Hurricane Maria when it hit Puerto Rico one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the U.S family and how did that happen\nVery warm water on the Gulf of Mexico very light winds aloft a this has been a season where conditions in the central Atlantic have not been particularly favorable for tropical development but it's just a goes to show it doesn't really matter where a storm forms as long as the conditions near an over it at the time\nOr can allow it to develop a it will develop very quickly um and yeah it is the intensity and the pressure was lower than Andrew when it came ashore um and it's one of these circumstances Jeremy that it was still kind of been a strengthening phase as it approached land and we've had several hurricanes in the last decade that have weekend as they approached land\nA ... it's a reminder that that can happen but the other the opposite can happen as well they can be strengthening as they approach and that's what that's what Michael did\nHow well they didn't hold up in terms of the forecast of of where it hit and the impact that it had well\nHow

Edgar says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nWhen you look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal\nFrom our perspective we wanted to go and take an option to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going in challenging us on that issue\nDo you respond to some of the opponents of this who say that by not having a sanctuary city or\nBy not having a sanctuary city or a sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation\nYou know what I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around all is telling me to stay in the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal\nThankful for what we're doing because we feel that uh or they feel that basically by us not abiding by these things where he lives what happens is these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community\nAnd so from their perspective they are very thankful I think a lot of this this is the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on on the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and seen a phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um I probably the best example and the real life example I gave us my wife is from Iran\nShe came when the shah was overthrown she's a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait in turn to get into the United states that so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I actually you know with my wife is an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or racist\nMore than a dozen cities in California has\nImmigrant or race is more than a dozen cities in California has sided with loss Alameda in defined the state law marches Ito is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest high\nHe says the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nI feel that this has become a political issue and it really should be it it should be a nonpartisan issue and it's a public safety issue ages I is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nAnd if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be where we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nA lot of these immigrants that come across illegally or abused I've met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help\nThese immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or they were talking about criminal organizations that are doing this\nBut he says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system\nBut other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary la ... Vita is is a city\nThere we believe in the dignity of all people\nWe believe in the dignity of all people the city of ... or ... about eighty percent Latino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in another country so\nAre the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city insurers that we send a message to all of our residents that they're going to be treated respectfully ah with dignity and at the city is here to serve them\nWell we we spoke earlier with the city manager from Los Alamos who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that's not about racism why um why I'm doing this\nUm [noise] I don't hold back my uh laughter there it it it is a frankly a pretty\nShallow a response there was no need for the city will selling me to take the position that they did\nOther than to send a political message or they're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not a welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope and we believe in the\nDignity of every person who answers our city and that's what it means to be a century city and when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor the criminals you say what\nThat he\nA liar and has no idea uh about the laws and and the law the land he oftentimes talks about a violent criminals and I do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable\nI Do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city's downtown I Believe that any violent criminal should be hounded ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time\nHowever if you're only crime quote unquote is leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to uh survive being able to provide for your family that's not something that\nI see that uh the city should be looking to arrest somebody for\nSo what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is a lot certainly when we do here that's not what my mandate is to my officers um we respond to behaviors respond to criminal behavior irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from I say it makes their job more difficult what do you say to them so federal authorities\nAre you know that they have the mandate 'em to enforce federal law or we do not\nAnd so it's like lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide services to the folks live here um they have their mandate to enforce federal law in there and they do that so um the other pieces it has to do with community trust and others\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to call us for help\nPeople to feel comfortable to college for help if they're not calling the police who are they common right so um the ideas um to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in in what the residency status we're going to respond and it's just the folks that call for help\nSo that's the chief of police in Santa Ana there is done Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail systems in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what administration Bush Obama and now Trump when there's somebody in our custody roughly just about ten less than ten percent of our inmates in our custody for local crimes not for ice issues\nAre here undocumented of that ten percent ice only really wants about one percent of those individuals those are the ones they place at the Tehran\nSo but isn't everybody in our custody it's just a small population of inmates ice has said they want that we can no longer communicate if we can communicate we release them back in the community\nSo you'd think S. B. fifty four is making this community less safe\nI Know it is making the community last day first a lot of the individuals who we do who are arrested or being returned to the communities in which they originally preyed upon so we know that's happened\nWe know of as of since January first we've had seven hundred and Seventy two through September this year individuals criminals in our care who ice had place to detain are on that we could not\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

Center for politics\nI found that your support is actually highest among the thirty seven percent of likely California voted to approve of President Trump or so I mean do you want do you want that support do you want to be the the darling of the right as well as you know being a Democrat\nLook it's a it's a bit of an oddity that's for sure and my values on my values and my values of the youngest child of a single immigrant mother with a third grade education my mother had the courage or convictions to come to this country to seek a better life so\nI'm as the author of century state or for California I'm as the leader in negotiations for raising the minimum wage to the heights of the country Fifteen dollars an hour and also the author\nAs for raising the minimum wage to the heights of the country Fifteen dollars an hour and also the author one hundred percent clean energy for the largest economy in the world that has legally committed itself\nTo do carbonation agreed um my values have always been for working families in California and that's why and um my goal is to be a new voice for a California's in Washington DC and\nUh it's a it's an interesting attitude that's for sure but I'm campaigning with with a two all voters up and down the state of California doesn't make a difference if you're in northern California Southern California in central coast or Central Valley [noise]\nWhether you voted for Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton or Trump supporter or I Believe that all Californians deserve a real voice is going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about do you think that you'll have a good relationship with President Trump if you become the senator from California\nWell I can tell you this ah from day one I've always taken a a an opposition position with him ... identified from day one that this was a man that you couldn't trust and this was a man that was a clear and present danger\nTo our economic prosperity tore values and to our people now that's dramatically different had Jeb Bush won the presidency or John Kades tickets they even someone like a Chris Christie or even Marco Rubio\nI'm either Democrats I'd be disappointed but I'd get over it in a couple of weeks and try to figure out what we can find common ground to move this country a forward together um within the spirit of normalcy within the spirit of the American body politic\nBut this is something that I didn't fight from day one is being dramatically different and I think that's why we can't allow one look toward liberation reverse of generations of progress at the height of our historic diversity our scientific advancement our economic output in a sense of global responsibility you've\nCriticized Senator Feinstein over her handling of the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh you've accused her of gross\nSexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh you've accused her of gross misconduct and said she had a ... she showed a failure of leadership by not bringing the allegations forward sooner a Republican Senator Tom cotton and others have called for Feinstein to be investigated you support that\nWell I don't because I think that's a politics I don't support investigation of Sarah Dianne Feinstein but I Would have taken a different approach to rank cabin on two separate counts or I Would never have open the door to his confirmation to the third circuit court of appeals basically the farm team for the Supreme Court\nSenator Feinstein volunteered her vote in two thousand six to allow this man a known partisan political operative\nTo hit the Senate floor for confirmation\nAnd I would not vote to confirm sixty percent of Trump's judicial nominees now these are as we know lifetime appointments and these are men who [noise] um oh surely will undo a woman's right to choose workers' rights civil rights\nA voting rights are environmental laws so [noise] uh this is something that I Would have done dramatically different than the current senior senator from California\nWhat would you have done in those hearings or what would you have done in those hearings what would you have asked what can tell you this I Would never apologized to rent cabin uh for the women who were exercising their First Amendment right of the constitution to protest a lawfully and have their voices heard because of the fear and panic things id they have\nTo um you we witness um junior senators such as ...

C. especially when you are the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S Senate seniority has not been working for California I think that's what they want in today's day and at an age when we have a president who occupies the White House who is\nUm a a threat or like I said a few moments ago to our economic prosperity to our values and more importantly tour\nMick prosperity to our values and more importantly to our people to you don't think she is fighting for California [noise] I think that ah she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated\nAnd no longer apply to a to California into the rest of the country um I think that comedy um and there's bipartisanship I'm which I'm fine with bipartisanship I've always worked in a bipartisan manner is the leader of the president of the California state Senate\nBut this is very different ball game in Washington with this president who seeks to undermine a workers' rights women's rights are voting in civil rights as well as our environmental laws\nAre I think it takes a different type of representation in California wants a real fighter that will fight for their values and who they are and what they represent today not yesterday you think the Democrats should try to impeach President Trump if the Democrats take back the house in developing\nWell I've always said from day one that I think there's enough evidence of for a an impeachment of uh the current president I'm\nI have not uh been dissuaded or for the position of taken it is not a partisan position of taking I don't think Democrats or Republicans should play around with the idea of parts of the ship for political purposes or this is based on a legalities\nAnd being the commander chief the chief executive officer of the most powerful position in the world I think there's sufficient evidence uh for the members of Congress are regardless of who controls are either chamber to move forward with impeachment now obviously\nIt's clear that the Republicans don't have the courage to move forward and do that\nIt's clear that the Republicans don't have the courage to move forward and do the right thing but if the uh the house has taken over by Democrats or I Believe strongly that they should move forward with the impeachment\nAt Ninety One point seven KU in Reno Ninety One point five K. and C.
