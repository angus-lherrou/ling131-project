John looking to use well\nThank you for the beer and John I Want to get right to it ah the president and his son and not just the president attacking Ford last night but the president and his son Don junior officer repeating the words of\nA conservative commentators like Rush Limbaugh that this is actually a dangerous time for men uh Don Trump junior said he's more worried for his sons and his daughters\nIs this a new Republican strategy we're hearing and in his so do you think it's a good one\nWell let me let me attackers from a couple of different angles first of all um I Do think that the president got a little bit caught up in the moment of a rally\nAnd I think we got to be careful I didn't take that that he was mocking a professor Ford I took that that he was questioning some of the inconsistencies\nIn her story tone of voice which showed me the second of all K second of all there are elections coming up and one of the things that we have found since last Thursday is what particularly some of the things the Senate Democrats that on the judicial committee\nHas actually engaged in rallied a and brought a lot of Republicans home we we know that the Democrats were engaged in together since the day Donald Trump got elected but Republicans were saw going into that\nSince the day Donald Trump got elected but Republicans were stopped going into the twenty Eighteen election and frankly what a lot of sitting on the side Republicans saw\nActually moved them to become much more than my age like one or the ... election excellent I think we'll look let's just take the the Quinnipiac poll that came out that forty nine percent of Americans not Democrats Republicans but both\nSaid that they thought that a Kavanaugh was uh the victim of a political attack we saw that for example we learned at that that hearing almost a week ago that\nThe Democrats somehow forgot to tell professor poured that\nThis could have been done and closed doors out in California because we know they wanted the spectacle of of the day and having twenty five million people tune in like they did uh we found out that a ... that she wanted this kept confidential yet somehow some way that\nThe proceeds will be used to purchase allergy emergency kit educational materials and more information at the peanut patrol dot org [noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners or W.

Smith and one British scientist Gregory Winter or sharing the prize\nLet's bring in Peter door how he's president of the American Chemical Society and he's in Manhattan, Kansas at Kansas State university\nUp Peter welcoming first the royals Swedish Academy said the winning research applied the principles of Darwin in a test to explain that [noise]\nSo first of all let me start out with my congratulations on behalf of the American Chemical Society to our three Nobel new Nobel laureates there\nTo our our three Nobel new Nobel laureates there they're tremendous breakthrough work in using chemistry to speed nature's own processes and that's that's the reference to Darwin in a test tube\nOf the laureates have used chemistry to accelerate the evolution of natural biological molecules that act as the critical machinery in the cells of living organisms\nAnd when we talk about Darwin I think most people know this term natural selection is that in play here\n[noise] well uh ... being able to identify a process within a cell and to have that cell lived through the next generation\nContinuing with that particular new process inside is in ... in a sense of a natural selection that will survive if that new process improves the environment for that so why is this work significant\nWell ... the ability to actually go into a simple cell as we might think of it\nAnd to do some fundamental chemistry is actually a lot more complicated than it sounds and if we do chemistry in a beaker flask\nWe control of fewer of uh the the variables and and we're able to really understand some of the outcomes that we all Timothy observe\nBut you know you know living sell like uh uh whether it's a bacterium or or or other living so it's a lot more complicated than just a simple bicker and I'm the real breakthroughs here to be able to\nAnd um the real breakthroughs here to be able to fine tune that chemistry for a desired outcome and ultimately to have that desire to outcome occur and the next generation as opposed to waiting for a slow evolutionary process as it is really what's so spectacular\nHere and now we're reading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also pharmaceuticals are what are some of the real world applications all this\nWell to be able to um use the um the molecular machinery within a sell to make chemical compounds are proteins that's what sells normally do anyway but to be able to ask that sell\nTo make a specific molecule is where the real creativity comes in\nSo imagine being able to provide a set of instructions too simple cells and have those cells repeat that process over and over again under very mild conditions the chemistry suddenly becomes a lot more interesting because we can do some very complex\nChemical reactions but do them in a very clean environment\nAnd so really the the sky's the limit in terms of identifying molecular systems that we could imagine making in chemistry environment like a beaker but doing it in these um these organisms that enabled us to um\nTake advantage of their natural process sees an example I'm of a natural process are created through um a an organism like like east helps our bread rise\nEast helps our bread rise in the house or a generates I'm a ethanol or alcohol and then the production of beer or wine\nOkay let's talk about one of the winters Francis Arnold of Cal Tech here's a recording of her getting called late in the night by someone from the committee to tell her that she had one and she was remarkably calm\nYou you're away from home so perhaps some projects protected from the immediate ... says can happen today\nI don't know I think I Can't reach out [laughter] so yeah it sounds like I said I Love and model [laughter]\nOr it's a Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry yesterday we reported on Donna strict Linda Canadian scientists only the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics for her work\nWhat does all of that mean for science and specifically for for you and chemistry\n[noise] willing I'll also point out that come from what I can tell this is the first time that women in physics and chemistry so we're recognized as laureates in the same year\nUm and but you're absolutely right in the case of professor Arnold\n... she's the fifth woman's and prior to that it was Dorothy Hodgkin's in Nineteen sixty four that was recognized and then you start going way back to Marie Curie in Nineteen eleven and then actually her daughter um several uh two decades later so\nFor us in the American Chemical Society where we're at the center for me personally were really advocating for [noise]\nFor me personally were really advocating for\nBroadening the participation in the chemical science is specifically\nFor folks from all different backgrounds and and perspectives and for us recognizing the the fact that professor Arnold's work has has risen to these levels is just it's just fantastic\n... is president of the American Chemical Society he's there at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas Oh thank you so much for talking with us\nThank you very much Peter and I'm a I Wish everyone a great day\n[noise]\nThat was nice let's go to Colorado now for a story that many of us may have missed but not if you're in Durango that's because lego sculptures had been popping up around Durango for the past couple of years it's the work of Sam bridge I'm the lego bomber from Colorado Public radio Stephanie will has this story [noise]\nThan Britain asked me to meet him outside a coffee shop on drinkers main avenue and swear newspaper hats and he could identify me ... and I keep an eye out for an adult now in his fifties instead and greeted by a blonde haired eleven year old\nHe tells me he's than the lego bomber and take me on a tour of course his art [noise]\nThe sand leads me to lego sculptures around the town many are surprisingly discreet you have to look up or down to see one posted outside businesses and I almost missed the Lakers and the sign for the old main post office they look like they're ...\nAnd I almost missed the Lakers and the sign for the old main post office they look like they're part of the stone work\nAnd the post office is called\nWe put it up only a couple of days ago but\nOur tour and an old junior high school that's been converted into space for yoga and art classes there we\nFind a bright green centipede like a lego creature crawling up a wall along with sand but I finally call them out on his roots and remind him I've seen pictures of the actual than Britain\nWell they're taking photos of the older me okay\nThe older Sam who is was born in the sixties can eat the older Sam today probably okay can you grow up right now okay [laughter]\nYounger sand disappears down stairwells an older than emerges from around the building or you know older than\n[laughter]\n[laughter] Oh nice to meet you [laughter]\nMarketing putting\nMe to get that young [laughter]\nI I learned Britain's impersonator is ... and one of his assistants he has a posse of them but when Britain began lego bombing two years ago it was a solo endeavor\nI was just really frustrated one night on line in my bed and I'm I'm I'm not ordinarily a praying man but I Try to I gave it a try got nothing and uh just felt really irritated and decided to go vandalized something\nHe happened to have hundreds of lego is lying around because he teaches lego robotics there his own business called alpine educational associates\nIt just took all these lego some plastered in on a on a pose trying to offend somebody and what do you know it was wildly misinterpreted as art and if you're a ... [noise]\nYou know it was wildly misinterpreted as art major and but\nNow many of his young lego robotic students helped him construct ... around the city including places like Starbucks side or the window at the drive through pharmacy at Walgreens\nIs is that the new season polio radio\nAnd for that we are truly grateful to you in our public radio exist because of you banks'\nFunding for here know comes from the listeners of W.

it was a part about the laughter that got me that's what my male friends said to me he said it was when Dr Christine Blasey Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter for her to alleged attackers\nThey were having a good time she said at my expense my friend said when he heard that that was with through them that over half a century ago he was seven\nI'd gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target we're going to cash treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like glassy Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left\nAnd my friends now well over sixty pretty\nThere are a threat while they left\nAnd my friends now well over sixty pretty strong he cried at that memory\nA lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lousy Ford and many of their supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked for they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying\nThe national sexual assault hotline reported the busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline calls tripled\nAnd Brazil oh heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the city's rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome thank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nBeen very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which is a nearly doubled from the week prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago for say on friday or calls were a little more than doubled from the week prior and we're continuing to see an increase call you right what do people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing a return it as a nation we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to a doctor for its testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact and we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy is she\nTell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody at a flash back you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical slash backed by think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that\nYeah absolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey are right back in that moment today if they feel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this you heard of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pinned down and I had another friend telling me just imagine regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe lousy Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words this isn't about sex did did people do people when they come for help it when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about in the feeling of being choked of being of being and mobilized of being frozen we know\nIn and mobilized of being frozen we know that when we experienced trauma\nOur brain is going to react typically in one of three ways we are going to fight we're going experience fried or we're going to fleet and was lousy Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing about it as well from the survivors that we work with we usually\nPeople have a flashback she's also explained us that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor ... I didn't sing too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talk to survivors about their trauma narrative\nThey are able to define frequently what the worst part of that experience was\nAnd so it might be the worst part related to the disclosure it might be the worst part related to the response of the alleged offender\nBut we know that survivors have the capacity because of all the way the trauma is stored in the brain to literally ... presents themselves and re experience that trauma in an incredibly intense way\nWell some of us thought that she actually sounded Fifteen times and I didn't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that moment\nThat was certainly my a sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to and what that was exactly like for her time yes yes yeah\nLook the majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg after watching the hearings revealed that she'd been grouped in forcibly\nByrd after watching the hearings revealed that she'd been grouped in forcibly kissed by man when she was Thirteen Shireen Ghorbani a Utah congressional candidate went public with her sexual attack when she was eight years old\nBette Davis President Reagan's daughter a revealed that she'd been raped by a music executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know\n... you know what's happening to his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her lips was new than\nI did you get home I don't remember how did you get hurt on remember when it was the point I don't remember I Want to hear you don't want I don't\n[noise]\nI don't know [noise]\nAnd Brazil again from the Chicago rape crisis centers\nWhat happens when you have this huge national dialogue and people are feeling states to come out and tell their stories and then suddenly there is a pivot now we're hearing the president and his son say it's a dangerous time for men who are being falsely accused\nHearing from callers that they're feeling just man but there will never be enough details to convince some people but a crime was committed they're feeling invalidated\nPeople that a crime was committed they're feeling invalidated by the national conversation by the victims they mean and they know that they will not be able to recall one hundred percent of the details and this\nFact about traumatic stress reactions the way the brain and the body processes trauma is being used against survivors to invalidate their experience\nBecause of Dr Ford said and as I saw many others have said and anybody who's had a traumatic experience of any kind of knows you're taken out of yourself you do forget some of the details I mean that's not uncommon\nCorrect and that's the way that the brain and body works to protect survivors and it's a part of trauma and so to expect a survivor to recall the exact details of a sexual assault without assault was five days ago five weeks five months five years for Fifteen Years\nReally lives the incredible complexity of the way that the brain operates and and honestly contributes to victim blaming and myth making around sexual assault and sexual violence\nAnd we should say that Christine Blasey Ford did describe some of the things the president said that she did and but at any rate uh others have said it's like trying to describe a nightmare so we wait the FBI's investigation and the Senate decision tomorrow what do you what do you bracing for\nBracing for increase calls a tour hotline we're bracing for increased requests for counseling we're bracing for our current clients experiencing triggers and\nThink survivor is find themselves you know in this incredibly powerful moment caught between pressure to come forward and a feeling that their experience will be invalidate\nAnd a feeling that their experience will be invalidated I think this is an incredibly critical moment for our country for our government for survivors of sexual violence across the country", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "03"}
