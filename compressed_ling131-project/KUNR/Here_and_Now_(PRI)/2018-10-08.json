social movement this powerful since the Tiananmen Square protests of Nineteen eighty nine ... ...\n... thanks so much for having me here nice to talk to you tell me first the focus of the book is the feminist five these are five young women in China who are at the core of your story um the theme that you present is the political is the personal give us examples of how among\nIs the political is the personal give us examples of how among these five women are the personal became the foundation of their activism and also who they are what they did\nRight so um these five women became known as the feminist five after they were jailed and twenty Fifteen for planning to celebrate International Women's day\nUm and it wasn't just those five women there were a lot of women in different cities across China who were planning to handouts stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses\nBut before they even carried out their plan the police in in all of these Chinese cities just carried out a sweeping round of arrests\nAnd focused on the five women the feminist five brought them to Beijing and detained them\nFor thirty seven days before there was a huge global outcry their resulted in their beliefs are being detained for what is it done well well um well this is this is what was so outrageous about it because I'm the authorities were kind of feeling around for something to charge them with an end in the end it was something\nAkin to disturbing the social order\nUm that the the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanize so many so many people and the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because of all they wanted to do was to handouts stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment\nOkay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to uh just doing something like you had to go stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first\nAre making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women the film this fine\nUm well I mean among the founding of five quite a few of them um had suffered abuse in their personal lives well growing up\nUm for example the nights herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle\nUm some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse and and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who are have been involved in the women's rights movement\nHas personally being um victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence\nAnd that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight back\nOne of the of some of his five oh one month for instance had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men and joined only need a bachelor's degree\nYou know there'll be some people who remember mostly don't use a famous adage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China or equal was that ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nWell I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to have seen the double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the and the\nFact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either in the city\nAnd said that they assigned them jobs either in the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the confinement says of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and the and and the propaganda the rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do um and so even today you see the legacy of that early communist era because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms\nUm but but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who've been laid off relative to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially and so many ways\nAnd that's a big part of why this feminist movement has grown is because of\nA dissatisfaction with\nWith this huge gender gap that women you know have to put themselves behind men and and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair what what is the threat that the Chinese government feels\nYeah well I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um that if you look at the bigger situation of China now the economic growth economic mirror\nChina now the economic growth the economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they are slowing economic growth\nThe workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically so the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing\nA particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do\nBecause these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and massage any and the subjugation of women pushing women to return to these traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother\nUm all of that is at the core of\nWhat I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how is the Chinese government pushing the\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long then their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media\nThat women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant um they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or race\nKyle bearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies um so the the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's being encouraging are trying to push\n'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on population the birth rate still fell last year and this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government\nAs it looks to the future um and so there's this huge confrontation now between\nThe agenda of the government which is pushing a very traditional gender norm I'm pushing women into the into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand but then you have this enormous I'll swelling of I'm particularly educated young women\nWho are pushing back in every way um and so what is unfolding right now isn't just an extraordinary moment in China's history\nAnd the Internet played a big role as well more and more women went online and we're sharing their stories and other areas I work with all the censorship going on in China will well this is what is so fascinating because in spite of the intense Internet censorship which has become incredibly sophisticated\nThat these women are ... there are so imaginative that they find ways of circulating their message and getting around the sense of ... censorship I mean just to give one\nAnd getting around the census of censorship I mean just to give one example there was one activist who um when the hash tag made too as being very heavily censored this one young woman came up with the idea of using him oh jeez for rice\nAnd Bonnie which which is me tool in Chinese which sounds like me too and so that was one way or that they were able to gain\nFunding for here in Studio ...\nFunding\nFor here and no comes from the

them in danger and conservative Tehran, Iran\nHer latest book is called here to stay it takes on the issues of Islamophobia and cyber bullying at a private school near Boston the hero is a high school junior name be Shaun he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court has some ugly consequences\nSarah Verizon has a child of parents who came to the U.S from Iran I asked her what she and that student be John have in common\nWe went to a similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly\nWhite an affluent um private school as you did I did which I was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller so should um\nGive it up we both love comic books we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help\nHe is of mixed heritage his dad is Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here\n... his dad is Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here\nSo you place to be John directly on the basketball court um Dijon is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in social status very quickly but then things change what happens in a school\nSomeone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues ... right right and heat you don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photo shop image of him to look like a\nTerrorist holding an AK forty seven was in ... right All right yeah sort of jumped on the air and has sent it anonymously to the student body so the schools trying to figure out who was sent to his mother and other parents are are very upset and I'm wanting to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK\nOther students are that are behind him an allies sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to\nBe a kid and so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be um the poster boy for international politics right [laughter] and people have all sorts\nOf rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kind of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to did you have to deal with it I sort of did the thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and the sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school\nAnd racial profiling and the sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating\nA Japanese person to a Korean person where it so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking not invasive questions but sort of like they never really thought of it before you\nCalled us polite racism and this is something that the John faces as well we asked what's the difference between polite and ... where he says I think most people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism but there's a difference between\nPainting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window\nVersus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of a little barbed or and made to sort of other someone so how does speech on in the book realize that to understand I think he's\nHe's had to deal with sort of it's in for that he's sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never been as viral as he does in the book and he for the most part is pretty cool and calm and collect\n'em and stands up for other people in his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal monologue you can tell that he is really hurting\nAnd I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know set up er yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to to have them have a pretty rich in her life\nSo he puts up with a polite worries\nPretty rich in her life so he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book deplorable or not deplorable I mean what what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist\nFor me personally it was really difficult to write this book because they do want to get away from books that are sort of like where the character has to deal with Islamophobia I'd like the character to just have an adventure or you know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters get to do\nTwenty of just like you don't want it just like the character doesn't white lady chose your person you don't want to be the\n... well no but for all kids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and this is you know what I have achieved but I did want to sort of address this thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or get over it maybe after the book finishes\nBut for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with and maybe don't get a lot of media time\n[noise] what do you what's the pay off for you is it just getting the book out there do you want to hear from people who recognize themselves on one side or the other in the book for better or worse\nI Am concerned with people who maybe feel at the book doesn't represent them fully but it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main care\nFully but it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people were not expecting and really love\nI just want this kid to really even though he's fictional I'm very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting they'll hurt real people last\nIf you were you know I mean this is a young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and you wanted to conversation to be started among students what would be the theme of that conversation\nHuh I Would say what does it take to find one voice and prejudice times\nHow can you stand up for yourself and others when that's really difficult which is a great hope but we'll see how that pans out\nSarah ... thank you

in the crossfire a civil war started there in twenty fourteen today in Yemen\nFire a civil war started there in twenty four team today in Yemen much like in Syria the fighting has turned into a proxy war involving other countries on opposite sides of the U.S back to the coalition led by Saudi Arabia it's trying to oust rebels known as who these who these are backed by Iran\nDavid Miliband has seen all of this up close he's president and CEO of the international Rescue Committee David Miliband you were just in Yemen two weeks ago what did you see there\nI mean Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis this is a country of twenty eight million people\nEight million people are being fed by the un world food program every day it's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine and ... eighty three percent of the population are in extreme poverty and the temptation is to describe this is a tragedy\nIn science is an indictment because this is not saying natural catastrophe it same man made a trauma that is the result of a war that has been waged over the last three and a half years I mean neither side winning\nAnd I want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels it's very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about yeah\nI mean Yemen is a conflict goes the hall of the trauma that he's going across the middle east at the moment the government of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen by who the who the who feeds are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived\nOr they rolled over the then government and capture Seventy percent of the country I'm what's happened since then is that a Saudi led coalition with us support and so you kind of the European support so it's not that far from home because the U.S is very strongly implicated in as a Saudi led coalition has been trying to pull the Yemeni control\nAnd as a Saudi led coalition has been trying to pull the Yemeni control of the capital Sana'a on up Seventy percent of the country the truth is the Eighteen thousand bombing raids that are being led by the Saudi led coalition has shifted the front lines of Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic\nIt goes through the port of data which is currently choked truly a by the fighting only a trickle of aid and commercial traffic is getting through\nI'm what's happening in Yemen is that that conflict between the who the I'm the Saudi led coalition has both in the Iranians are supporting the who the Z\nBut hey either right then the other side from the Saudis the lesson UK exactly so immediately you have a theological splits Sunni Shia you also have a split of trout regional power struggle but in the chaos of the groups are emerging separatist groups in the south\nI'll ... drove the Arabian Peninsula in the east ISIS growing as well in my case the case that I saw with my own eyes is this is a humanitarian catastrophe\nOr the levels of malnutrition are absolutely shocking in that country that children literally starving to death but at the same time there was a political emergency too because the only sign that he's gaining from the current stalemate all the extremist of al Qaida and ISIS\nAnd it's a ... treat now which is on the verge of melt down not just humanitarian melt down but political melt down I'm going to tell you what does that mean it means that the humans are a meltdown is the three and a half million people on the verge of famine forty thousand children are waiting for hospital places in Yemen\nOr there was a few to support the hospitals there isn't the fuel for the cause you can see half a mile cues at gas stations on the\nRoad you've got teachers and doctors and nurses were not being paid because public sector salaries and not being\nTeachers and doctors and nurses are not being paid because public sector salaries and not being paid as a country which can't sustain itself at the moment is being ravaged by war\nThat is not to the benefit of any of the signs are waging it but in fact being exploited by extremists and I think the onus\nOn the permanent members of the Security Council including the U.S on the u._k. is to recognize that this crisis is of no it's no one's benefit the war is not being one and the only way to address both the humanitarian and political emergency is a cease fire\nWent into whole stop digging and that's the message that needs to go to the Saudi led coalition\nSaid hold on right there for a second what is it that the Saudis the u._k. the U. S. and the others\nWant what's their goal they do is first of all to roll back the influence which they see as being allied to the Iranians\nSecondly to reestablish what they call the legitimate government\nThat was in place before the two thousand um fourteen or two and a third Leon importantly for Saudi Arabia they want to be secure or from missiles being sent from Yemen into Saudi Arabia and there's no question that who sees have launched missiles into Saudi Arabia so there are legitimate security concerns\nBut what I saw was the price being paid by the Yemeni people far outweigh the costs that were being imposed on the other side\nWe should say that the U.S secretary of state Mike Pompeo since the coalition is taking steps to minimize civilian casualties\nSticks in the ... because I met a ... who ... told me about missiles had landed on a hospital next to a health care center that we were delivering\nAnd they all know about the fact that the Saudis bombed a coach of school children more than forty of them killed in August is extra state your in the U.S interest that Mike Pompeo has it\nKilled in ... such a state your in the U.S interest that Mike Pompeo has indeed a certified as he is required to buy a congressional legislation that everything is being done to protect civilians why we know that seven and a half thousand civilians being directly killed a Monday indirect effects on far larger numbers\nAnd why would the U.S not want to protect civilians why would they in the u._k. and even Saudi Arabia I mean why would that not be a priority I\nI'm not costing any at home and I'm a judgment what I'm saying is the fact is that civilians are not being protected them to come up to the war has breached the basically the most basic norms and international humanitarian law both on the Saudi led coalition side and on the who decided independent un inquiries\nHave produced extensive documentation of terrible breaches of international humanitarian law in other words the targeting of civilians by both sides\nAnd this is a crisis that now I came away saying that the world needs to wake up to what's going on in Yemen and the tragedy is at the U.N General assembly there was no all night session of the U.N Security Council on Yemen the u._k. holds the pen\nOn the Yemen filed dependent needs to be picked up because there is not a current debate to replace the failed un ... resolution of twenty Fifteen with something that is actually a roof map to peace rather than the ... pool\nIf we take the issue of 'em are refugees which obviously the higher the focus is on to the U. S. indirectly to Washington um you have said that regarding help from the western world\nThat you've moved to a relatively benign climate to a relatively hostile and we know the Trump Administration has cut by Seventy five percent the number of refugees it admits into this country and for a year\nThe number of refugees it admits into this country every year how does that affect your work\nWho just for the benefit of your listeners are about twenty eight million refugees and asylum seekers around the world today most of them are in poor countries not rich countries countries like Jordan and Lebanon countries like Kenya Ethiopia Uganda countries like Bangladesh historically\nFor the most vulnerable refugees widows victims of torture often children the U.S has stepped up and being a leader and was called refugee resettlement which means bringing about on average about Ninety thousand refugees the or the U. S. actually on the Reagan Administration that was over two hundred thousand\nAnd those people go on to become productive members of American society the Trump Administration has festival changed these security vetting arrangements they want you to update them that's legitimate for any government to do but they've also reduced by Seventy five percent the cap on the number of\nRefugees are allowed into the U.S and that obviously means individual lives are affected their off fifty thousand Iraqis who supported the work of the U.S military and government in Iraq translates into things\nThat are being allowed into the country either so there are individual stories of people who fear for their own lines who can't now starts a new life\nTo work in the U.S which is part of the reason they're in trouble because I ended\nUp being targeted because of ... with us then not being allowed in either so you've got this clamp down on a refugees fleeing for their lives clamp down on people who would claim refugee status because of the work for the U.S\nGovernment and the great danger is it a bipartisan program of proven success remember refugees contribute more to the American economy than they take out in a welfare payments are proven program is being strangled and this year um we're\nA proven program is being strangled and this year um we are having to deal with the fact that there was a historic low in the number of refugees allowed in only Twenty one thousand in the fiscal year the ended on September\nThe ... the Trump Administration has ... into the U.S at ... feeling of thirty thousand for this fiscal year which started on October\n... the first and so what we see is not just the effect on individual lives of those who would have come here there's also the fact the countries around the world is seeing the U.S doesn't have that back\nIs Kay you win our public radio\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

dressed up and cop uniforms and rang the bell it was one twenty four in the morning and the thieves approached the palace road entrance of the Gardner Museum\nThere have been a cake party nearby a few revelers were still on the streets and when the fate cops told the museum guard on duty that they were responding to a disturbance it seemed plausible maybe some drunk kid had gotten up to some mischief\nAfter all earlier in the evening the guards around had been interrupted by a fire alarm blaring from the museum's carriage house outside it really spoke to him maybe that's why the cops had come and so we ... them into the museum that guard was ...\nThey came in and they turn so I could see if I could see that they had had scopes badges that looked like up so I was and the rest of the

a day job kind of thing to supplement the income make sure the bills get paid and so forth\nRandy knew a couple of people who worked at the gardener and that's how we landed his security job there\nIt wasn't something that required you to have any kind of special skills you know as I remember being trained to if any people were getting real close to a painting and we were told to get them to stand back a little bit and don't get so close\nA few months into his job Randy began filling in on the overnight shift the pay was better eleven dollars an hour versus seven or eight bucks for the daytime shift\nYou know at nighttime when there are no visitors when you're not doing around you can bring stuff to read and I could bring my horn and practice I was always happy to say yes to filling

requirement that he register his presence in each of the galleries on all the SARS during his round he did that by swiping a magnetic strap he wasn't originally on the scheduled to work the overnight after St Patrick's Day Randy was filling in for another guard who had reportedly called in sick\nEdited told him about the carriage has alarm but he hadn't thought much of it until he saw the two police officers talking to us at the watch task\nIt never occurred to me that they might be anything but Boston police I immediately made that connection I owe this might have something to do with the alarm that went off\nOne of the uniformed man said he recognized Abbott and asked to see his id\nHe said yeah I Do know you there's a warrant out for your wrist and he told Rick to stand against the wall or put his arms up he does a pat down he puts the cuffs on [noise]\nAnd I'm just standing there with my job open going wow you know what what's going on what the written due to see really in some

putting the duct tape and he says this is a robbery and so then that everything was finally crystal clear what was going on you know it was just really strange [noise] none of it made any sense and

very scary and I'm worried for my life [noise] um but they were immediately saying I can remember both of them saying you know follow instructions and you will knock it hurt so that gave me some
