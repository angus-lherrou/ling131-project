S. seeking asylum but it is happening right before the midterms one of the political implications\nOf the political implications are pretty big because this is the president's go to issue and he has really grasped onto the caravan he's even said that the caravan and Kavanaugh will be the two most important things about the midterms he's\nNot only said without evidence that they are criminals he's even said that there are terrorists or he's repeated some of the a commentary on Fox News that they are members of ISIS or al ... somehow\nIn the group of people who are traveling to the border by the way they are about [noise] last time I checked there about three thousand miles from the U.S border but he runs saying the Democrats are funding them so this is an issue that he thinks\nEnergize his base it's what he started out when he came down the golden escalator talked about Mexico sending rape is this is his go to issue\nA lot of Republicans would prefer that he focused on the economy and the strength of the economy right now here is a President Trump speaking to reporters outside air force one on Saturday\nWe'll look it up again very major tax cuts for middle income people [noise] and if we do that it will be some time just prior I Would say to them [noise]\nHave major tax guy we're going to be putting in [noise] had are studying very deeply right now around\nA major tax cuts for middle and\nA major tax cuts for middle income people\nNow Mara Congress has not even in session a right now and November is coming right up ... what do you make of this\nHe's just making it up as he goes along there are no plans to put their congressman and session as you said they can vote on this\nBut he said it's going to be major it's going to be for middle income people why because the tax cuts that they already passed or not popular Republicans thought they'd ride these the tax cut bill to victory in November but people don't buy it broke RMC polling Republican Party polling has shown that people think the tax cut when mostly to the rich but this is\nWhat President Trump does you know he used to call this truthful hyperbole and some of his books\nYou know he's talked about liberals rioting for sanctuary cities he's talked about how the arms deal to Saudi Arabia he started out saying it would produce forty thousand jobs in America now he says it will produce a million jobs he said Democrats want to give luxury cars to illegal immigrants I mean he's just improvising\nOkay the Democrats do not have a President Trump right now they don't have one leader at the moment but there are a lot of candidates that are running around the country I Want to take a listen just to maybe a closing argument from one of them this is the Democratic governor a candidate in Florida a Andrew Gillum a from a debate with the Republican Rhonda Santa serious\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

were abducted from the school in ... book in northern Nigeria the kidnapping provoked worldwide reaction including from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month\nLike millions of people across the globe my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their school dormitory in the middle of a night\nBut then what happened to those girls some managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released their stories told the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram it airs on HBO tonight\nAnd joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha ... ... so the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram they're living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a part of the condition of the access we always see the kid the access with the government's consented to any way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the details about what had happened to the gym three is that they were held by Boko Haram why am partly a I mean they was you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative\nBut also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them and not governments safe house in early July so\nAnd not governments safe house in early July so it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks so it was quite rule they um we're still processing wanting to happen to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us when all counsellors to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened that we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to\nBuddy clearly anytime we wherever alone with the girls the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government also wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see that goes time in captivity because they were held for three years before and they say some wisdom and they were released\nWell what do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like well they they um low they was free to speak to is they did give us that diaries discreetly\n... and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they were forced to marry if not they would have the what they called the and the full Boko Haram treatment ... ah and\nThen the phone what we do is the uh the girls that you book goes who were taken would actually just the tip of the ice but there are thousands of girls in Nigeria here were taken by Boko Haram who are free to speak and they do tell us\nWalked the Boko Haram treatment is so through that testimony we get a sense of what happened to the ... foot goes as well\nWhat happened to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one\nGirl in your film who was married had a kid ah with somebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's of Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the film is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a soldier or you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave than you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the golf felt like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we fast that had like she she did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well uh and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have ... have either been kidnapped or killed during this will say about ... than kidnapping children but also\nWe'll say about ... than kidnapping children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fight\nAnd then when the military engaged with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill an arrest or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching how terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they've just flooded their towns out of fear of book around they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah it is functioning I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns and these they called them id Pete comes a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run through because Boko Haram you know they don't just could not be then Ben and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even know places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous producer safety by numbers on that whether the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that's why you have to run\nTheir ... but then a lot of the I Love the tiny displaced people end up living within the community say despite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they will ...\nTowards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they will have been incredibly welcoming to the numbers displaced people who have come to made a gory\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they tried to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory is in a kind of normal front line will would say it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize it's controlled ... Nigerian military and\nTheir constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan\nThat was sick suicide attacks\nIn one night and you just never know who to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stop them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into ... said the city [noise]\nAnd so there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line ... ... you just don't know why this is coming from and where and when I said there's a lot of mistrust\n[noise] what about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and try to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including a some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them from your film\nI'm not and you mentioned ... and has it changed my life now and I thank you\nChange my life now and I mean ... ... ... [noise]\n\nDo you see a bright future for some of these girls yes I\nThink ah for the ... girls who are are in a un of the American universities I dropped the American University in Nigeria which is where all the girls who were released a negotiated full and ah the escaped goes who owned the nights that uh\nThe kidnapping happens so tuned in Seventy six were kidnapped\nFifty seven of them during the long journey on the back of trucks to somebody's various kind of jumped off the back\nAnd half of those have gone straight to this uh University in yoga and that's where these beans that are three is and they feel positive about life and so the two book goes everybody just stopped he lived on a year at the university\nFunding\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

Simpsons Bob's Burgers and the family guy they also got a peek at the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy to\nMore or less thought it would only do we have fought for ... take on prime time with a five minute we can't we can't say\nThe Sunday Edition sponsored by Google ...\nHere and now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind us\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that audiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots\nAnd also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nAren't let's take this first change Fox is calling it the nine ... nine second sixty seconds ... nine sixty seconds break jazz pods jazz parts what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which being sued traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second year this has got a problem when there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nIs it also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain right right so\nAnd because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand the content is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block a brand new content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and uh and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content it's\nOK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSo the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in volume advertises like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth so this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain a\nCarroll here and now media analyst thanks very much thank you so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile ride sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThey're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers and he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from that\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders Samuel company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost two hundred fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so getting around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nWe fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority in that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specific how get around works are right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYou know so you don't arrive you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like the rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you'd pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nA lock the doors and try and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to attest led to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's Toro or which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight\nMillion monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a massive opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more of this market gross for all players\n... well some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said\nThat those companies and sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent what do you what do you think about that I mean are people really that eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nIs I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely an ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's absolutely true yeah\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on ...\nWhat's your plan for that money it's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partners some some great companies like turn over so it was continue investing was partnerships and expanding our roster partners\nWill speaking of super and Toyota I mean these are companies also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and it's something that we've since day one than\nSort of very aware of in fact it was a ton of his cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if you're going to drive itself would you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and this maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those carts be used by more people different cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opened a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around were checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of vehicles are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me than drop it off and then they would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in the world were were fifty years out in the town of media sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where you know the cars we know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be\nYou know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in around ... and outside of cities in suburban areas\nUm any of those cards might be self driving but they're fundamentally not no self cleaning or self maintaining until there's a lot of infrastructure and sort of network functioned is required to sort of operate those vehicles and that's very close to even what we do today right we help owners\nShare cars efficiently in urban centers across the United states and we work with partners you know who helped service those cars or keep them on line and and continue to operate

explanation Turkey's president ... says details of what really happened will be revealed and a speech that he will make tomorrow\nJoining us now is Jane Harman president of the Wilson Center and a former Democratic congressman from California\nGerman welcome back and you think the u._s. should consider new sanctions against Saudi Arabia over this\nI think condoning murder is something we should not stand for our foreign policy is based on values and interests and values that we have in this country a rule of law and a freedom of the press or both of which were violated in this case I Believe\nA an interest that we have are working with allies like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally against things\n... like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally\nAgainst things like a Iran's malign behavior in in the region a and surely Iran has been engaged to proxy terror groups in malign behavior especially targeting Israel but also elsewhere I mean a Saudi Arabia claims that Iran is meddling in Yemen\nAnd Yemenis targeting Saudi Arabia and that's why Saudi Arabia's in Yemen but at any rate uh I don't see how a condoning what happened even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened\nIs in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proved that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also ah suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old\nCrown prince a has a some some growing up maturing to do and that it might make sense from the Saudi point of view which is not something the U.S would dictate\nA to have a a you know some kind of a adult supervision are there are so that excesses in his behavior\nWould stop happening I think that would be in Saudis interest I think that the the war in in Yemen has created the the largest could humanity to humanitarian catastrophe that we currently she and I think that this episode especially if\nThere was a Saudi cover up and plot uh to to do this is a really shocking and in every sense\nDo you think that the Trump Administration which has been watching the war in Yemen go on for years now a un hasn't put the pressure on the Saudis to uh stop it that this was going to change President Trump's relationship for example with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nPresident Trump's relationship for example with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nI think the Trump Administration wants Saudi Arabia as a good ally in the middle east and also as a good trading partner I think those are two agendas that it has\nAnd ah I'm not against either agenda uh but what I'm against is condoning bad behavior or in order to make sure that agenda continues a I think we can do both\nLearn more about services an appointment at south ... dot

endorsement to New Jersey is democratic Senator Bob Menendez and it does is facing a challenge from Republican newcomer Bob you get in the paper writes that\nThis is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this race who's a reporter with WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe in Germany so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption ended in the midst trial last year he's been trying to change the subject\nEver since a at a recent campaign of and he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country how has that been working out for him\n[noise] ah it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say he has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and ... and has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nBeen over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location in our state\nCampaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nDespite all of that are there have been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party to Senate majority pac just dropped several million into the race to cement Menendez has lead and in New Jersey\nDemocrats largely are standing with him um you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so when ... says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob huge and he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about just\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate finding [noise]\n... you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not twice was re times for drugs that those cancer patients politically need\nHe has blamed insurance companies for some of the costs of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at ... as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him well it's\nHe's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\n[noise] well it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug reveling that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that many patients are vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up\nCell gene has also you know ... uh settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA but you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he he went to the\nThe Republican convention so you know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's a he's a first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with Menendez is ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about um it keeps coming up in my conversations with people\nBut so do Menendez is ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know ... tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey is pretty pretty reliably democratic in that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years New Jersey is ...\nDemocratic and that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years New Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that however these races do happen um you know New Jersey often\nDoes elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank little beyond those retiring this year after decades in Congress so it does happen but it's surprising this race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party\nAnd just his popularity and previously\nThat is Joe Hernandez of WHYY talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got to\nKnow now that our next story might not be appropriate for all listeners it's estimated that hundreds

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed\nAnd that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity\nWhen what\nReally shapes and a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend that time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decide that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that a lot of time they're spending too much time on their phones they will in their own words often describe themselves as addicted\nBut Ninety five percent of teens um had a smartphone now and it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to your friends taxed instantly to want to be the first to post a like an ... and so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but generations ear I ... is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history and that's reflected in these big um surveys that I work with whether asked about\nTree and that's reflected in these big um surveys that I work with where they're asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds so say high school students of course because the high schools they go to a more diverse much more likely to um have friends of other races and ethnicities to hang out with people from different backgrounds\nThat's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped this generation\nWell\nThat's hard to tell from the the data that we have because\nUm you know foreign policy is arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\n[noise] true um but because there's not a draft road that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHer company's marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\nYeah they they do have to market to this generation differently because there's this such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adults but in their conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors\nAre very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on\nAnd um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness\nAround stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing\nAround stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing is another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\n[noise] I Wish I could say yes I'm\nBy statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government and voting or are not encouraging so in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to sense they're interested in government or social issues or politics\nDan teams were say Twenty years ago why do you think so um well I mean because there's so many other things to do\nThere's always the possibility of a ... something new to see on I'm On social media or a new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens\nYou know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard ...\nInteresting I mean I've had some many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general um but they're also often really smart ... I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nOh absolutely they're definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all this information and um they're they're quick thinkers on there was actually data showing that IQ has has gone up over the generations so I think sports is is definitely not the issue\nSo obviously a generation Z is going to have to deal with\nCecily a generation Z is going to have to deal with some of these problems on their own as they get older ... and and even right now what can those of us in the other generations due to to assist in any way with some of the problems of this generation\n[noise] well I think we do need to be aware I just how severe um the mental health crisis and right now among teens and young adults so there's a little awareness around that but not half as much as they as there should be that we're seeing unprecedented levels of depression and\nSelf harm a among teens and young adults now and we need to have more resources and more awareness of the causes behind that and then more funding and awareness for treatment", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Reno", "day": "22"}
