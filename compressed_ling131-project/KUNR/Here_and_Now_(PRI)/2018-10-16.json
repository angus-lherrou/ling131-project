now secretary of state Mike Pompeo is in Riyadh Saudi Arabia he's been meeting today with king Solomon and the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nAnd they'd growing concerns about Saturday involvement in the death of journalists and us resident ... ... ...\nThere are reports that Saudi Arabia is getting ready to acknowledge that ... died during a botched interrogation at the Saturday consulate in Istanbul, Turkey for the latest let's bring in ... at MSNBC anchor an economics correspondent and co host of ... in rural highly hey Jeremy and what more do we know about this new Saturday explanation for what happened well\nWe we know it hasn't fully hasn't come out yet are there are a lot of reports that it's being crafted what's interesting about this is that it echoes something that a President Trump said yesterday morning after he'd spoken with king sol bond the father of Mohammed bin Salman his son effectively runs Saudi Arabia\nAnd the you know yesterday the president talked about a a rogue group of people maybe having a ... a and then that's what the Saudis are floating\nAt the issue here is that the Saudis are looking to accept responsibility in some fashion for this so that the story can move on at the moment they they're facing the threat of sanctioned and a lot of businesses that are very upset about this whole thing so they're ...\nAnd uh a lot of businesses that are very upset about this whole thing so they're trying to uh work their way out of it but no explanation officially and\nWhen you said the explanation was being crafted ... does that imply that my ... the secretary of state is helping the Saudis craft the explanation for what happened\nWell it's unusual that before an explanation comes out my Mike Pompeo is there a if one could be a fly on the wall one might assume that uh my palm pay was explained to the Saudis at this is a difficult position for the United states to be in because it is such a\nA supporter of Saudi Arabia and because of the global Magnitsky Act which a number of senators have triggered\nA that say that when the United states has dealings with a country that engages in human rights abuses the president has to take action within a hundred and twenty days so Mike Pompeo maybe spelling out the fact that the president may not be able to skirt the so the Saudis need to do something so that the next step can take place what\nHas all this done to the U.S relationship with both Saudi Arabia end with turkey where are the the alleged murder happened\nSo this is interesting because turkey and Saudi Arabia or not allies they are they they sort of compete for being the economic and power center of the Muslim world arguably Saudi Arabia has succeeded\nA because Saudi Arabia has such largest but Turkey's more industrialized country it's more western facing it's a NATO member turkey as you know handed over pastor Andrew Brunson who had been jailed for some time so it does seem that turkey in sort of throwing Saudi Arabia

throwing shade at President Trump in fact that's the title of his book shade a tale of two presidents Pete Souza joins us now to talk about a welcome back to hear now\nThanks for having me on Germany and when you left the White House or did you have any idea that you would become more part of the public conversation\nNot at all it's it's just something that ... as the days and weeks and months went by and twenty Seventeen\nIt became apparent that I had a voice where uh I and I needed to use it in a way just to demonstrate what is happening is not normal and I thought I was able to do that on Instagram using my photographs and commentary\nAnd how did it start it started\nAccidental I had seen a uh\nIt started somewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office like on January twenty first there twenty second and it was ... you know golden ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than\nThe oval office so I posted a picture of a President Obama with the the red curtains behind him and I wrote a caption that just said something like\nKind of like the old curtains better [laughter]\nAnd I guess it was a double meaning in my mind but I didn't know how people would react whether they would get it and in that very first post someone or said that I was throwing shade on the new\nUh the new president you didn't even know what that term it I didn't even know what that term that after you know I started oppose the war and then I heard that the term shade again and I and I figured I better look it up\nYou also posted when when President Trump made a lot of news talking about how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history and a lot of people showed photographs to prove that that was not the case you posted on January twenty first twenty Seventeen\nThe biggest credit history was really on January twenty two thousand nine huge in all caps with a picture of the national mall with a lot of people on it\nI mean a kind of picture says it all\nRight right in that case maybe more than any other that that that the picture was what prove what was true yes do you get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentary there's very rarely is there a negative feedback and and what's interesting to me is if I'm if there is a lie or it's going to follow\nIf um if there is uh my uh it's ground followers are have my back and they they ended up coming back to the ... and they often point out to me\nUh people that that they feel or just bought maybe I don't know if they're rushing bots but people trying to stir up trouble not really interested in my Instagram feed just and saying what they want to say\nA in this book I you've got I'm often either Trump tweets a alongside your Instagram post or a news story alongside your Instagram post there's one I'm looking at right here\nA President Trump said on may six twenty Seventeen the reason I'm staying in Bedminster New Jersey a beautiful community is that staying in New York City is much more expensive and disruptive meetings exclamation point you wrote stuck in meetings at sunny lands in rancho mirage California twenty sixteen and it's a picture of President Obama golfing\nRight I mean let's just let's I well I don't understand why the the person the United states can't be honest I mean just say you're staying in bed Bedminster because you want to play golf ... and ... just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me\nSo that was sort of just a you know tell me in cheek hawk poke I guess\nWhat's the one that you're most proud of that you like I Can't believe I thought of that [noise]\nAh the the [laughter] I have to I correct myself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right comment I guess you know a Trump is always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points and all cats\nI don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points and all caps a ... in regards to the FBI and investigation um [laughter]\nAnd I and I found a a picture of a a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party\nAnd I just I think I wrote um you know another kind of witch hunt I I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that the more people that have been aggression and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history Fox News ... every other networking you Instagram\nForty eight million people watched the twenty tends to the union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up [laughter] uh and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama's was a two thousand ten state union was the largest and in history\nIt seems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happened you show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\nA yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter] ... you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked it I cried myself up over was\nWhen he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong moon and ... and calling and little rocket man and rocket man and you know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff\nYou know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff [laughter] and I posted a picture of President Obama with a gun right and I said there's only one\nRocket man [laughter] what does President Obama think of what you're doing\nUm you know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in a coup boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now the the book is actually printed\nUm I told them that I was doing this book and he just you know he he didn't say that much about it [laughter]\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nThe un ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post among the steroid\nNo these are all a pictures that were previously made public honoring the administration so they are considered public domain so anybody can use and there was another guy that has a has a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama or do you would you want to do something else\n[noise] no I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from 'em at least us politics for sure\nHow come [noise] um because\nAs politics for sure how come [noise] um\nBecause I don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had a dynamic a a person to a photograph every day um someone that I had you know admired\nSomeone who gave me incredible access\nAnd I think I Would just be frustrated I'm trying to photograph politics when I Know that I couldn't get that kind of access to someone else at least I don't think I could and and and I've never you know I sort of ended up as a political photographer it was never\nSomething that I had aspired to do it just things just sort of happened uh because I took a right turn and instead of a left turn 'em and so I Want to sort of explore some other aspects of photography that I that I just don't get to do that much now\nTeaches at one more question for you um you know everybody now takes pictures with their phone you can tell when you look at a Pete Souza photograph that it's really great photographs compared to what most of us are able to do although some people are great amateur photographers\nWhat is your one piece of advice that you give to people about how to take a better picture\nOh boy I'm One piece of advice I can I give to yeah sure [laughter] um you know for\nRight ahead believing buddy you're on K even our keep it here eighty eight

year the little red schoolhouse or progressive private school in Manhattan decided to end an experiment a grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents are the minority students objected captain is director of the little red schoolhouse filling first what was your thinking and trying this\nUh we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help with their academic achievement well\nYou said that are part of this was based on a you know research this was an attempt to isolate these minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special in his foot um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this in the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a ...\nResearch points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and cultural identity oh what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that um those students who feel that\nThere is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing\nThat being part of a larger group having colleagues I'm as supportive of their development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could go\nSo we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students who have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students was one of the few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experience there having look research\nOn the academic or intellectual experience there having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural experience and let's say the teachers away and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experiences and that affects a minority students negatively it at home with a place where it's it's much uh you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher and the student in and out of place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences at our job as an institution is to find ways to me both of those in even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nYou know this isn't unheard of in twenty eleven a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school\nHad its junior classified itself for several minutes everyday along racial gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you were giving for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with\nBut you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated home that you had you know what do you worry about the wisdom that\nWe do and I have to do things about that one if you you know as people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice but it's what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color\nTo know that um you know these were students of color and some of their white classmate in a classroom with both white teachers and teachers of color having a parallel experience to the other home room and the the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from\nYou know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school [noise] so what happens now a huge drop the homeroom experiment so how do you move forward\nWe will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what ... what a lot of independent schools do which is to have race be one of the\nComponents of his students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nTo continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of our students have the full Hillary I experience I'm going forward\n[noise] by the way el R. E. I. that stands for the little red schoolhouse in Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan uh where you had to end is this idea of grouping minorities together in a home room when the kids say\n[noise] um some kids remain somewhat confused by the need um other kids feel super supported so lots of conversations with students coming forward\nAnd it's still a casting director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan don't think so much it's been a pleasure tomorrow we'll speak with an African American educator who says there are times to group kids of color together you have to get it right [noise] okay\nTimes to group kids of color together you just have to get it right [noise] okay wanna smile go now to hear now dot org\nAnd see the final is in the annual comedy wildlife photography award photographer Tom sell them as a judge he joined us by Skype from the Netherlands Tom these are just the final is how will you choose\nWhat is a very good question I Choose personally the picture that makes me laugh out loud and I didn't have to think about why I just that's how I Do my beverage technique\nWell let's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe it as best we can also have last year's winters up because those were hilarious\nBut this year it with a picture on his hands are held out his mouth is wide open as if he saying job [laughter] it's called caught in the act or from photographer Mary ... a gallon I mean that's a laugh out loud\nIs allowed and definitely one of my favorites I think it's very simple we'll just see the animal and the ...

six months journalists around the world have been working to finish the investigations Daphne started\nThanks to the nonprofit forbidden stories which continues the work of murder journalists and last week five members of the European Parliament called for the European Commission to back an investigation into college his murder\nCiting revelations from the forbidden stories work including that the Maltese government sale of Maltese passports to wealthy Russians for one million euros\nWas enabling those Russians to enter European Union countries and carry out money laundering and other crimes Lauren ... is founder and executive director of forbidden stories\nLaurent you and other reporters picked up quite a few of the threads that Daphne Carolina 'cause he was pulling on tell us more\nWhere we started to the worker for forty five or photos for about six months with ...\nForty five reporters for the past six months we were able to\nReveal some um information regarding the high level of corruption inside the ... highlands and we were reading some concerning Fox about some potential links between the economy minister\nAnd some of the people who have been arrested because they were triggering the boom there would be to really pushing the button pushing the button\nYeah they were using the cell phone that was connected to the bone under the calls for definitely don't want to get a job today\nOr she is she has been killed at least the aspect of doing that and they were arrested\nAnd so ... and with the world cup that's a collaborative\nTeam we were able to meet some people told us that they have seen that you couldn't even Easter with\nThose two suspects before the murder and the the ... the ... project was not only about to identify who might be the key those but it's up to complete the stories of Daphne\n... pizza very critical work because her stories was about sensitive issues like corruption organized crime so that's why we decided to conflict with death than the name of that political was adopted project\nSo again you know the multi government she was doing an investigation into possible corruption having to do with matters of the economy and here you have\nYou found the economic minister connecting with some of the suspects in her death that's quite something look I I just want it back up and and talk about how this started because it's in a compelling story you worked in a news agency across the hall\nFrom the Charlie Hebdo off his tell us tell us about your experience there\nAn investigative reporter for the past Twenty years\nWell an investigative reporter for the past Twenty years and um\nI used to travel a lot into 'em do some reporting in some countries where there was no freedom of press but to another think convinced me will personally a personality events in my life convinced me to talk for ... to reason this happened\nActually twenty Fifteen when ... of ... in Yemen arrive in the streets where the offices of the company where I was walking full worlds in Paris\nAnd they into the ... and they killed the ... newsroom and we were sharing the same thrilled that we're the right to the door right next to her and these day address arrived to date to me that ... to the terrorists escaped the building\nAnd I into the newsroom and then I\nI was uh the first to discover my friends and colleagues have shut the door just dying or just totally dead and we'd all best to help the people who were survivors and so\nThis really really changed my life because this was happening in Paris this was not happening all kinds of things are you watching Iraq twice in the middle of pirates twice in my purse and the environment\nHe was about ... new and we're doing exactly the same work as me the same job there were ... they were killed forced to read they were able to publish and so it was really traumatic experience and he talks a lot of time to recover of calls for that\nAnd trying to forget some very difficult teachers that on that day I decided what I can do as a journalist to continue the work of ...\nCan do as a journalist to continue the work of murder the reporters to keep stories alive and usually when authorities to use diving for wants to read that probably means that the story's very resistant to the public opinion it's very important to continue to keep this there was a life\nHe said something so compelling there he usually when a journalist gets killed there on to something and so for you it's about figuring out what that was it as you say sending a message out to the murderers you can kill the messenger but you won't kill\nThe message the story look at this has been going on for a while a when Arizona reporter John ... was killed in Nineteen Seventy six\nA new organization sprung up it was called the investigative reporters and editors and they set out to finish his work but there have been over sixty journalists killed this year many of their debts connected to their work\nWe also here in the United states in Annapolis a newspaper or was attacked in so many killed threats were made against the Boston Globe by California man he threatened to kill all of them do you\nDo you despair I mean it doesn't feel as if you know the message is getting out\nYeah well um we are really facing a lot of threats not totally\nInsults America not only in Mexico in Europe too in a an old continents and I think that\nThe the only response which is very efficient it's a global an collaborative response collaboration brings protection if you are working to get the\nIf the Cuba will see that there was a group of journalists ready to complete investigation and to expose the crimes event that will probably think twice the next time they\nCrimes event that will probably think twice the next time they would think about killing one report or you were talking about the origins project that's great and very inspiring project and I do think that we have to react this way\nWe have to send this pool full signal to the enemies of the price you kill the messenger you would never kill the message because we are\nHere to make sure people to get access to this is very important stories so\nYes there was a lot of work we need some support\nThere a lot of children just to have been killed a lot of many forbidden stories behind with that we need to publish\nIt's quite children to do that and a journalist was dying is just it's it's not just to a number we took ... important stories important information that some people want to to hide some people wanted to silence\nWell and there are other groups I met I mentioned investigative reporters and editors there's also the group organized crime corruption reporting project that pursuit another investigation twenty Fifteen when a of an investigative journalist with locked up in Azerbaijan a there is a Brazilian nonprofit organization\nI think it's average G. A. B. R. A. J. our eyes they continue the work of another reporter so this has been going on this as you say collaborative so that it's the investigative work is spread out among many reporters\nThat brings us to the Saudi journalist who wrote for among other papers the Washington Post Jamal could show the um US and Turkish officials believe that he was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey\nHave you been already eyeing his work\nWell of course I'm this is the kind of case that we we should be interested in what this term\nThat we we should be interested in what this terribly use he was ... he was walking on we need to to know mobile the Saudi regime and we need to to expose that so that so\nI Hope we get more information to build the disappearance of a of this um ... I Hope that we'd be able to get some information so the rug is very difficult country to rock and so he was a kind of voice very rare very unique\nSo we we we ... we need that kind of ... and so we need to to work to get those went to look at what kind of ... he was publishing those pastures\nAnd when I saw I'm Wondering he said when you came upon your colleagues largely cartoon is a satirical cartoonist from Charlie Hebdo within murder or were dying you said that you you said you could not get those images out of your head\nHas the work that you're doing now has at ease that at all\nThat's a very good question I'm\nI'm not doing that for being able to forget those kinds of different kinds of pitchers um [noise] but uh it's really helpful because I think that I wanted to do some sink as a journalist and so by doing that", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "16"}
