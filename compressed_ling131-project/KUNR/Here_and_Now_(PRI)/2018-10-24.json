the\nCountry got a little more heated yesterday the Tampa Bay times reporting that attacks shows the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout stars of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump favorite Ron dissent is by as many as twelve points in the polling the two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history probably as most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single payer health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged give to Gillum against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations\nBut first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here and at the very least we would need\nA conservative states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs and others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expend\nUh and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid or which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state right now are the Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government that right now is being given away to other states\nWhile we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissenters said that to a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to health care is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American he was also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem\nHe's in Tallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMy city is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate\nMiss the dissenters described out community as one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he's he clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognized that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what if communities do about it and what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted are restored of justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get the opportunity to\nSo that folks who are returning citizens to our community get the opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work this categorization of a high law this uh you know ... this is Trump be in politics it is not based in reality I Want to ask you about President Trump\nYou know in your debate with Ron descent as you said he was this huge for the president you made no bones about how you felt about President Trump and his loosen is without acts of leadership well an absence of leadership as you as you put it\nPresident Trump's pulling numbers they bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent to first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nWell I'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do with\nAh I'm teaching my kids what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes\nAround making fun of handicapped individuals\nReferring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter uh and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe it's completely inappropriate behavior\nAnd Mr descent as he is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself and apprentice Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and commonsense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of ...\nA racist Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society and a kind of a community where\nTo create a kind of society in a kind of a community where my kids will be proud to grow up in\nIran just answered said if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how'd you didn't work with the ministry and how all this money on many for the environmental plans that you have for this day\nUnfortunately for most of the center of this is not Russia\nOr we don't bow down to the president we work with\nA check for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement\nTried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama's stimulus money as much as I disagree with the conduct and the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Flora two point eight billion dollars\nI'm gonna take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor my differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on infrastructure help on transportation Rick Scott Knight who again don't agree on a lot politically\nDuring this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day on the phone\nTalk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent to Santa's is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to the reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting Governor Scott\nMy opponent can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the ...\nUndermined the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times as the mayor of forest capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the of Florida an aquifer\nAnd where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new church she every level almost portable level\nTo reduce the number of nitrate going into our groundwater when we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science put some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluter to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time\nWell listen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nWe recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we've got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow wrote to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum narrow Tallahassee democratic a gubernatorial candidate here in Florida now again thanks so much for speaking to us of course to take care part of our talk with Andrew Gillum this past Monday and as we said yesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from killing was old fashioned and lobby\nYesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from Guillaume his old friend and lobbyist Adam Corey\nShows that a man they both thought was a developer\nHad Broadway tickets for Gillum and others including Gillum brother now the text from Corey reads Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight Gillum replies awesome news about Hamilton Mike Miller turned out to be an FBI agent part of an undercover investigation into corruption not focusing on Gillum\nGuild says his brother had it in the ticket he assumed his brother pay for it here's what he told us in our conversation tell us about the FBI investigation according to New York\nTimes is going to snuff size it there was a lobbyist friend of yours that was actually a a friend as many of your friends are from your student government days in in college this is Adam Corey who introduce you to men who identified themselves as out of town developers they want to invest in property\nThey turned out to be FBI agents working undercover to investigate community redevelopment agency possible corruption you said\nThey told you that you are not their target but before you knew they were you may too personal trips with your old friend Adam Cory went to Costa Rica there's questions about whether or not you

exciting races to watch\nEarly voting is underway here as usual the state has some exciting races to watch we talked about the governor's race between the Democrat Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and the Republican former Congressman Ron dissent is there's a tight race as well for a Senate seat not on the ballot but on people's minds Donald Trump in a hurricane here's some of what we're hearing [noise]\nBecause he is a Democrat\nAmong Republicans some of the\nFor your school\nDoes\nThat Wendy of Alaska in Miami also with her Miami their rosy Patel a Jake Bernstein an Alexander to heal

it all and began surveyed oh an anchor for Univision special correspondent for fusion joins us from W ELL are in in Miami high Enrique Hi Robyn I'm getting closer to you I'm In your state I'm Glad [laughter]\nAnd we're the here in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan Romney Robin ... well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that he took tickets Hamilton I mean Hamilton makes it into this race and his share of a vacation that of a couple of friends took a you know it's just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers it turned out\nJust one trip that he took these as gifts from developers that turned out to be an FBI agent and a and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke a story the text\nIn which a Gilligan's friend a lobbyist told them about this Hamilton ticket or that this developer had for them Gillum respond awesome but he is insisting it even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket\nIs is this going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent is in some polling\nRight yeah I I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on what it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here or\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answers these questions I mean almost undoubtedly\nThe dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story\nUm and again it's going to come down to how he answers questions\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear a does answers on Fox News earlier this month\nKnow I have a positive relationship with the president to people in the administration Florida has a lot of names from our military footprint our transportation or water resources\nHas a lot of needs from our military footprint our transportation or water resources where it's been a big problem here and we need to work constructively with the federal government Andrew Gillum is running on impeaching Donald Trump I don't know what for 'em but I don't think he's going to be able to do anything productive way with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd mine so how is President Trump laying out and say\nWell I mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the Santa Scott the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump saying or\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent that tweet and being being Santas was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided\nWell before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for a candidate\nWell and we can say they don't let me bring you in here because of president also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November sixth elections and that's this and he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugees some say undocumented immigrants making their way to Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are doing something like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack on the border how's that resonating where you are in Miami\nThank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats\nLet me think he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the cabin and saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those um ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan at a very convenient time for the president\nIt puts the the the issue of immigration front and center which already wants to be honest uh in in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm um I Do think it could be one of those X factor is coming to the election Robin and I'm ... would really see the impact all the coverage and all the attention described and has had in the last couple of days and that he will have a in the run up to your mid term election\nUh we'll see that on a ... or ... depending on the turnout both parties I think I read it as a a turnout election well let's\nBe clear this is a cat and that are reportedly was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar in the last one that was of this size a group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last thing that made you got so much attention\nThat CNN is reporting that just three people\nOr were except in into the country so there is that but I just and just to underscore this Enrique we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nUm you will have people who will be of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people to seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point in Florida it's a great example Robin you see the Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have\nThe conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nTrump wanted to state in two thousand sixteen now you have Puerto Rican said many of them were all ready for it up before Monday about all the security Maria over the Puerto Ricans have seems a coming to Florida and that are\nUm some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role and resold\nUh for for the governor's race in in in the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not a monolithic communism different interest and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty willing lets us into a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson and Andrew Gillum will kill the economy they like high taxes um Andrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent [noise] center and also voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher taxes higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another uh apparently you never got your mouth washed out for soap after telling a lie because you keep on going on on every part of my record\nHigh daily from Kerry and his you here in Tallahassee I always colorful but who's on the edge here and I especially with the hurricane that\nThe edge here and ... and especially with the hurricane that just hit I every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept visiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's roof has been ripped off I mean he is seemingly everywhere so who's who's got the edge you know I I mean\nUh you know there was a the latest Quinnipiac poll released I think yesterday ... lead a at about seven points I mean a hurricane recovery obviously inherently political\nUm you know I think Rick Scott being the governor he he had the advantage invisibility and the response to hurricane Michael but Senator Bill Nelson the I think to his credit he visited emergency operations centers in Bay county here in Tallahassee\nVisited rural counties and raise concerns about their their abilities to recover um so yeah I don't I don't think that the hurricane response gave a Scott much of a discernible boost in his whole married\nStreaming live a K.

I think that we have our political differences but we all have to be careful about our political rhetoric and I think when you identify member of the opposite party is evil or as the mob or accuse somebody of paying for terrorists to come through Mexico to the United states\nUh you know words have consequences\nAlice any any any ticketing opportunity there because if you're referring to President Trump and did name [laughter] even though they you know let's do you think the rhetoric has been ratcheted up the you know especially to talk about the caravan\nA which is you know very far away from the U.S border and happens quite frequently these groups of people organizing by you know left leaning church is trying to help people get ready to status very few of them ever make it across the board are your thoughts on that and the language we've been hearing\nRobin we can all agree that the rhetoric began to be heightened well before the caravan and it it's it has got to stop and just started\nBefore the caravan and it it's it has got to stop and just started in the ... presidential campaign that the name calling and the the um disparaging comments at a on both sides but but uh it has to stop and I said all I\nDo not equivalent what is equivalent to the ... you see both sides do you think I mean the president is is using words like mob or you know do you think there's an equivalency\n... look the there needs to to be a more civil tone in the way we talk people on the left are angry and frustrated and speaking out and people on the right or angry and frustrated and they are speaking out and look I I at the end of the day\n[noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

felons have to wait at least five years and petition the state board to win back their rights\nBut on November six voters will decide whether to amend the state constitution and automatically grant the right to vote to more than one million people convicted of a felony\nIf it passes amendment for would restore voting rights to former felons upon completion of their sentence unless they were convicted of murder or a sex crime here now is Chris Bentley took a closer look\n[noise] it's opening day of the living harvest a thrift shop and south that lassie for stores managed and staffed by former felons making the transition back into society [noise] they don't want you to nonprofits found\nMaking the transition back into society [noise] stay away does the nonprofit found [noise] he was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for felony DUI and it was released in the year two thousand since then he's gotten sober and started this nonprofit to help others turned their lives around but finding housing unemployment\nI'm a big big person about second chances because I Know people change and I know the way I was it's those people have those opportunities they wouldn't be going back to prison and our community would be better for the\nWhite has already cast a ballot in favor of a madman for something that as a form of selling himself he can only do because he successfully petitioned the state to restore his voting rights he says it helped him feel like a part of society again\nWhen I was able to finally return home and try to rebuild my life partner that wanting to be a part of the community couldn't happening no I was able to vote\nIn twenty eleven governor Rick Scott rolled back reforms put in place by his predecessor Charlie Crist making it harder for non violent felons to gain their rights back\nHis administration has also granted fewer felons clemency Scott has approved restoring voting rights to just over three thousand people compared with more than one hundred and fifty thousand under crust\nThat means today more than one point five million people in Florida more than ten percent of the adult population can't vote because of the past felony conviction Eddie Kane is one of them he's been out of prison since two thousand three\nCain remembers how it felt to go with his family to the polls on election day unable to cast a ballot\nA set of the car [laughter] [laughter] I didn't even go into building a feel deprived of felt ashamed of failed ignorant there was a real bad feelings that thing that I I haven't even forgive him or suffer feeling like that\nCain says he wants to get his rights back but the process is intimidating and he knows it could take years all of us\nAll of us deserve a chance to show that we can live decently we could live with all the other people so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe should not assume that all at one point five million felons a and everybody sitting in Florida State prison system or have suddenly become good wonderful model citizens\nHarrison the founder of Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy a group that is against them and for he said there are a fair criticism is that the current process service during voting rights but getting what he calls blanket clemency with a constitutional amendment would be wrong that potentially dangerous\nClemency is not an entitlement it is not a right it is an act of mercy by the state of Florida and it ought to be decided on an individual case by case basis with due consideration for\nThe seriousness of the crime the nature of any harm that was caused a in a whole lot of other factors that we think reasonable people would think would be important\nBut some law enforcement officials say the current system is making for the less safe Leon county sheriff Walton McNeil agrees with Harris and that it's appropriate to take away some rights for violent criminals\nOr as relates to other things like ah you know the sexual batters who are as keeping them away from kids in the way from schools and and those kind of thing I Believe those are appropriate steps to take but just the fundamental right to vote there's no proof that are taking their right to vote away\nThat are taking their right to vote away deters them from any other crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole condition that showed ex felons who's right to vote was automatically restored under Governor Crist were less likely to commit new crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only serves to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic a fundamental rights as a citizen then they're more apt in my opinion to give up and turn to a life of crime or because there's no alternatives left to him\nThat something James Sawyer says he's experienced personally so he went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer while on probation he says when he got out not having the right to vote made them feel powerless\nI used to have ideas about who I wanted in office through next certain things but I never got involved because I said what I Can't make a difference so really it made me feel less than a citizen account made me feel like well if I'm not a citizen ...\nSo you're recently got his rights restored and while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure if he'll use that right he hasn't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIs kind of like a victory for me it's kind of like a a bucket list as part of a bucket list I'm not a political either and I'm not sure it will not vote in the ... I I just me but I like I say I'm not sure\nSeveral recent polls have shown public support for amendment for above the sixty percent thresholds that would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy a group of former felons is suing the state and a case currently before a federal appeals court supporters are hoping they won't have to\nBorders are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November for here and now I'm Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip the Florida Supreme Court in a decision about who has the right to a point three new Supreme Court justices to replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats\nGovernor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term ends but the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibility so we the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Ron descent as will shape the future course\nA hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her highland\nEven person I'm explain this decision will you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of timing the governor's usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get the hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really you by the time their terms or up it's\nAlready a new governor is in office and that's part of some of the ... the consideration that did go into those there's also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to\nSort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nIt's very different but I can hear president or former president Brock Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with you he of course wanted to do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ...

I don't make it through college or they're not college is not for them and we're trying to bring them together and say hey listen to the construction industry we we need you and it's lucrative I was talking to when my contract isn't the way over here\nAnd and these guys are making up or twenty five thirty dollars an hour is on fifty sixty thousand dollars a year to repair and air conditioner and that's climbing\nSo at some point there's going to be higher demand\nClimbing so at some point there's going to be higher demand\nYou're right we I mean we push college and so many young people the college isn't the right thing sounds like you need welders and you said plumbers and they need training\nAbsolutely yeah and and most of these curriculums or not you know they're not for your curriculums so they can go through a future builders America which is a high school program transition into a vocational school I'm so by the time they come out with some sort of experience in high school\nAnd they can be an apprentice and worked their way through vocational in a matter of Eighteen months or so\nAnd be in the field making fifty thousand dollars a year versus four year degree and they come out I read a average you know graduates making forty nine thousand dollars a year so they're not going to have the college debt that these guys have so it's you know it's lucrative\nI Want to touch on some of the other aspects of this but but not to lead immigration just yet\nIf you had the ear of the next governor you couldn't have a more red hot button divisive political issue right now than immigration and it's you're telling me it's necessary for your industry so what what would you want to see\nImmigrant workers are important to our industry for sure they are very hard workers often times the immigrants are the on the job before anybody else they're working hard there stay until sun down so they have a work ethic that we don't seem to have in the United states with our young kids now\nSo I Would ask whoever's coming in we need to have a way for these folks to come in and do the work that our industry and other industries need\nMarked are you saying you'd like to see more of\nAre you saying you'd like to see more of the workers who might be fit for your industry allowed in\nI suppose that's what I'm saying yeah as I've traveled again after this hurricane that we just had there's a lot of cruise tree cruise roofing crews and\nOne thing I notice in common of all of them is it's primarily a Hispanic workers\nThis area needs to be rebuilt\nAbsolutely we need more workers there I think those builders in that area are in a really bad place because\nTheir homes are beyond their place of business might be gone to shop that he had just gone\nIt's going to take a lot of builders from a large part of the country that's just the way it is what else would change this equation we see a move recently for a vote tech or industrial arts coming back to the high schools\nWe spent many years not exposing young people to that\nType work and telling him what Doug mentioned earlier go to college go to college the guys right here standing here doing this work for us today are making between forty and sixty grand a year that's a good job\nDoes she think there'd be some sort of government involvement in kind of making it more enticing what how else to get their\nRevert back to you know capitalism I think you know the fifty sixty thousand dollars and that's you know you get into supervisor heroes and you're you know sixty to eighty thousand dollars you know owner owners of companies double triple that one more thing I think stigma that's what the big talk was the last Thirty years\nWhat the big talk was ready to that last Thirty years you gotta have a college degree and kind of downplayed the actual getting out of your hands on and and doing work and I think changing that view is the big hardly you got to get over\nYou worry Florida's future is it maybe so uncertain because of the warming fees and the storms that are increasingly violent you worry about twenty Thirty years down the road that Florida will not have a building well\nNo I don't

similar to this wiped out of the city of ... so do I it's just you don't\nBelieve the recent report from the government that you know we got even less time than we thought maybe ten years instead of twenty\nAbsolutely no no I Believe it's cyclical you're a builder absolutely or twenty five years I\nDo believe we do affects the environment with what we do and what we build an area full of asphalt is hotter than an area\nArea full of asphalt is hotter than an area full of grass and trees there's no doubt no doubt about that um but I also believe it's cyclical more than that I think that we can
