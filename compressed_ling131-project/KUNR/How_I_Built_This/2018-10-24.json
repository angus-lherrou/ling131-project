is just how many times along the way he sees new opportunities or as to improvise and adapt again and again and again Ron comes to a point\nWhere he has to make a big pivot and transformed his business\nAnd in Nineteen eighty five three years after Iran acquires a small fringe bakery in Boston called a ... a business that's really struggling\nHe manages to turn things around with his partner Lou came but\nIt's still a small business in fact Ron himself works at the sales counter during the day [noise]\nLike doing that actually helps him figure out almost by accident his next opportunity\nIn Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five\nI Would be in a restaurant and working and I'd have a customer walk up to me go into the court I have a bad guy I said sure and they say slice it I'd have them do both and they pull out effect from the local supermarket from local stop and shop\nAnd they put roasted turkey and maybe [noise]\nCheese on it and you know you didn't have to be a Harvard MBA to say wow the real thing here is that the ... is nuts\nThing here is that the ... is not the end it's the platform to sell sandwiches and so in Nineteen eighty five we created the first French bakery cafe in the Copley Place mall in Boston she decided that you were going to make\nThis a new experience and New Zealand than experience where people could come and\nEat lunch and buy bread yeah we were going to go from being simply a bakery to a bakery cafe right and almost instantly is broken down company became very hot ... people wanted this I can remember the second

costs on but they were differentiated kinds of sandwiches they were roast beef in in ... on an real French back at it would be a\nRoasted turkey and brie cheese um and I think what Obama was providing and I don't think we had the language for back then but what the big recap I was\nWas an alternative between down and dirty fast food yeah and fine dining yeah and for people who were working white collar jobs increasingly in urban settings\nThis was the first example of what we later came to cough vast casual\nThis was an attempt to do something that was better but in a quick service mode so so once you serve stones idea of creating cafes and bakeries it was after the races you just I mean at that point\nAnd bakeries it was after the races you just I mean at that point it was clear that you were going to begin a pretty rapid expansion\nWell ... ... you know as soon as we came up with this idea of a decree cafe we saw all kinds of interested in how we became hot [laughter] you know every major office building one of the French big cricket and we found we developed big competitors\n[noise] alright says something something happens early in this period as shortly after you go public which is a long ten acquires this a small chain of St Louis based\nSandwich shops called the St Louis bread company what what's the story there why did you buy this like small chain in St Louis was it was the idea to to turn it into a ... [noise] no I you know\nI I talk to everybody in our industry and there's nobody I don't learn from and I was asked by an investment bank to meet several gentleman who owned a company called St Louis brand company and it hit me these were Nineteen stores in St Louis doing ... almost as much as we did with an old bump it but\nDoing so in suburban St Louis and it struck me this was an opportunity to acquire St Louis bread company and maybe we could build it into three hundred four hundred five hundred stores in the suburban marketplace while oh bump him was our urban strategy\nSo in November of Nineteen Ninety three we bought the St Louis brick company\nWas Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars\nTo youth choir St Louis bread company and you will not going to give it the name of them had it was going to be a St Louis\nGive it the name of them had it was going to be St Louis red company or did you initially did you immediately realize you're going to rename this thing\nWhere we rename than cuts a Panera Bread\nIn all markets other than St Louis but we renamed it ... bread because as we went to new market people often thought St Louis was more associated with Clydesdale horses a hour than it was with Brett right and so we wanted an empty vessel personality we could form\nSo out of curiosity in that by Ninety eight near you're watching St Louis ... really start to grow do you remember how many stores you had at that point where we could you expand beyond the original Nineteen yeah by Nineteen Ninety we\nRoughly had a hundred and fifty stores and I was having one of those moments that all CEOs have of self reflection and frankly I was kinda bummed I was looking\nAt ... as one of four divisions in this\nMulti divisional restaurant kind of on than I had a bump in a lump and international I had been there and I had a bump in manufacturing and I was with a friend and I said you know for every hundred people talk about having a nationally Dominic ...\nTo do so is so difficult ... but he said this one has that potential and my friends looked at me and said Ron what would you do it a narrow\nOwned Obama pen not ... I said you know I take away all the resources we had put it against an Arab becoming a nationally dominant brand\nAnd I take myself and the very best\nDominant brand and I take myself and the very best people we had and I go down there and make it happen you were proposing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "How I Built This", "city": "Reno", "day": "24"}
