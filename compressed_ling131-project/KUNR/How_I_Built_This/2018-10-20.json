from NPR show something you're going to notice about Ron shake and the story of how we eventually build an Arab red is just how many times along the way he sees new opportunity\nIs just how many times along the way he sees new opportunities or as to improvise and adapt again and again and again Ron comes to a point where he has to make a big pivot and transform his business\nAnd in Nineteen eighty five three years after Iran acquires a small French bakery in Boston called a ... a business that's really struggling he manages to turn things around with his partner Luke came but it's still a small business in fact Ron himself\nWorks at the sales counter during the day [noise]\nLike doing that actually helps him figure out almost by accident his next opportunity\nIn Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five\nI Would be in a restaurant and working [noise] and I'd have a customer walk up to ... so they could I have a bad guy I said sure and they say slice it I'd hands and the ... and they pull out a back from the local supermarket from local stop and shop\nAnd they put roasted turkey and maybe\nShe's on it and you know you didn't have to be a Harvard MBA to say wow the real thing here\nIs that the ... is not the end it's the platform to sell sandwiches and so in Nineteen eighty five we created the first French bakery cafe\nIn the Copley Place mall in Boston so you decided that you were going to make this a new experience for new open pen experience where people could come and\nEat lunch and buy bread yeah we were going to go from being simply a bakery to a bakery cafe right in almost instantly is broken down company became very hot people wanted this\nIs broken down company became very hot ... people wanted this I can remember the second day um that we opened in Copley Place we had fifty people in line while before we open the doors\nAnd what were you serving their um we were serving sandwiches\nAnd some soups made on our Breton course on but they were differentiated kinds of sandwiches they were roast beef in in ... on on a real French back at it would be a\nRoasted turkey and brie cheese um and I think what Obama was providing\nAnd I don't think we had the language for back then but what the big recap I was was an alternative between down and dirty fast food yeah and fine dining yeah and for people who were working white collar jobs increasingly\nIn urban settings this was the\nFirst example of what we later came to cough vast casual\nThis was an attempt to do something that was better but in a quick service mode [noise] so so once you know surf stumbling idea\nOf creating cafes and bakeries it was after the races you just I mean at that point it was clear that you were going to begin a pretty rapid expansion\nWell guy we you know as soon as we came up with this idea of a decree cafe we saw all kinds of interested in how we became hot [laughter] you know every major office building one of the French the cricket and we found we developed big competitors\nAlright says something something happens early in this period as shortly after you go public which is among panic choirs is a ...\nIs among panic choirs is a small chain of St Louis based sandwich shops called the St Louis bread company what what's the story there why did you buy this like small chain in St Louis was it was the idea to to turn them into a ...\n[noise] no I you know I I talk to everybody in our industry and there's nobody I don't learn from and I was asked by an investment bank to meet several gentleman who owned a company called St Louis brand company and it hit me these were Nineteen stores in St Louis\nDoing by um ... almost as much as we did within the bullpen but doing so in suburban St Louis\nAnd it struck me this was an opportunity to acquire St Louis bread company and maybe we could build it into three hundred four hundred five hundred stores in the suburban marketplace while oh bump him was our urban stress\nSo in November of Nineteen Ninety three we bought the St Louis brick company\nWas Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars [noise]\nAll right so you choir St Louis bread company and you will not going to give it the name of them had it was going to be a St Louis bread company or did you initially uh did you immediately realize you're going to rename this thing [noise]\nBut we rename than cuts uh\nAll markets other than St Louis but we renamed it ... bread\nBecause as we went to new markets people often thought St Louis was more associated with Clydesdale horses are now than it was with Brett right and so we wanted an empty vessel personality we could form so out of curiosity in that by ...\nPersonality we could form so out of curiosity in that by Ninety eight near you're watching St Louis ... really start to grow do you remember how many stores you had at that point where we could you expand beyond those original Nineteen yeah by Nineteen Ninety eight\nWe roughly had a hundred and fifty stores and I was having one of those moments that all CEOs have of self reflection and frankly I was kind of bummed I was looking at\nAn Arab read as one of four divisions in this multi divisional restaurant kind of on pan idle bumping along PEN International I had been there and I had a bump in manufacturing\nAnd I was with a friend and I said you know for every hundred people talk about having a nationally Dominic ... to do so is so difficult but he said this one has that potential ... the my friends looked to me and said Ron what would you do it narrow\nOwned Obama pen not ... I said you know I take away all the resources we\nHad put it against an Arab becoming a nationally dominant brand and I take myself and the very best people we had and I go down there and make it happen you were proposing\nTo sell all bon pan", "show_name": "How I Built This", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "20"}
