four Gary and Samuel ends stony field are almost broke their basically running on fumes and they're trying to bring in more money by just finding a few more stores to sell their yogurt\nThose days as a whole foods didn't exist yet but the holy grail for natural products was a little free store chain called bread and circus which eventually became part of hope\nAnd they had one store in Cambridge prospects drink and you know we were selling now to Jim Lewis market basket this is now I'm Talking July of eighty four and um and we were desperately trying to get down there because we knew that if we can crack\nBread and circus every other little natural foods co up in New England would then take us in\nAnd we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont to in the TPP with their ... do you know they didn't need another you know organic yogurt from some crazy people in a hamster [laughter] so what did you guys do so in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday\nWhat you guys do so in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday at the farm and my I had my old ultimate Frisbee team um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge as you might imagine\nAnd um I said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under bread and circus I'm prospects in Cambridge and asked\nFor my yogurt that was on a Sunday on\nWednesday Mary Carol Skinner the buyer bread and circus called and said Garry I don't know what's going on but demand is suddenly gone through the roof were getting all kinds of requests for yoga get it when when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first delivered that afternoon [noise] um about a month later we were her number one selling yogurt\nOr she took us in the other two bread and circuses and off we went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles is last Eighteen Inches that makes all the difference you get it on people's mouths and then they're going to ask\nFor an end run around the time you\nMeet Meg he would become your wife right\nYeah so a month after that fateful meeting with bread and circus we had our summer no ... northeast organic farming association conference and I I as it turned out I was the keynote speaker and uh right after I finished my speech this very\nAdorable or organic farmer from New Jersey who is running her own nonprofit farm down there a waited patiently to ask me a question well that turned out to be what is now my thirty one year wife Meg\nAnd her mom had been the deputy commissioner of agriculture for New York state\nSo she had a kind of an ag orientation um at one point she kind of whisper\n... um at one point she kinda whispered to me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with lending me some well of course I needed money so she loaned us a fifty thousand dollars [laughter]\nI started raising and I I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ...\nA sort of a month or so later she says well I think we can increase and so she increased to a hundred and eventually I got to cross the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want\nWhat they called F enough money first friends and family money mhm as 'cause they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know some Harvard MBA with with with a tie\nBut if it's your mother's money yeah yeah and so now we worked for our moms which must have been pretty stressful oh yeah\nYou know what happened in this farmhouse I always had payroll and Thursday mornings\nAnd by this point it was a half a million dollar business and I never had cash in the bank that night before payroll never just this is became our way of life and so uh thinking Meg was a sleep in our bedroom which was about fifty feet from my office\nI Would on many occasions tip toe over\nTo the office to call my mother in law\nTo have a chance to see if I could borrow another thirty five hundred twenty five hundred to make ends meet and eventually make got onto this and one night I heard the click click a call waiting on my mother in law is on and make was calling from the house to say mom don't do this what your wife was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because right well because\nHer mom not to lend you money for the business right because right well 'cause she didn't have confidence and that's it\nWe're looking she's living in a nightmare me she saw how crazy it was I mean we had chimney fires we had the well pump would go out that the power would I mean we're on the hilltop farm a long way from anywhere\nWas make saying do you listen to ditch this thing this bag it I mean or or did she because it sounds like maybe she didn't believe in it well she had no reason to believe in it it was insane but why did you believe in did you think you know where you are what two three years into this thing\nAnd not only are you not making money you are in debt big the big time\nYeah [noise] well I'll say this I'm Meg or you know fortunately loved me even more fortunately probably love the yogurt and we're nowhere else to go [noise]\nYou know she had given up her job done on her farm in New Jersey and signed on to this crazy them enterprise but here's where the story if I Know that you think it couldn't get worse but as as a\nLily Tomlin says it it it ... it it got a lot worse before it got worse okay what happened what happened well so now I'm going to jump a year and a half [noise]\nWe've now expanded the plant were buying milk from ten or twelve farms wow and we have maxed out this little farm there is no you cannot squeeze another drop of yogurt out of this place\nSo presumably you are looking to to work with another factory\nSo spring of eighty six we are out of capacity we contracted with a little dairy in western Massachusetts Greenfield mass we were desperate we did not do any\nIn western Massachusetts Greenfield mess we were desperate we did not do any of this financial due diligence one would normally do\nWhat happened for us was their bank went in and put them into chapter seven padlocked the place locked it up",
