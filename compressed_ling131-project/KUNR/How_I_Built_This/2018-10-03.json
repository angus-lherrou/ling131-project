not\nWhat happened well it's funny you you hear people talking about tipping points my experience is a little different I think it's kind of a series of tipping points that\nYou know they get relatively bigger if you're fortunate overtime but one of the early ones was I went down to a to a trade show down in San Diego called the ideal world fitness convention and I set up ten by ten boost down there and I had this kind of fake door that I had put together and to anchor it\nAnd we ended up selling outta everything we hadn't well and I had to have my assistant overnight me you know where we had left in the shop there so the second day of the shows a three day show the second day I was basically selling paper futures\nAnd then that thank goodness the product arrived on the third day and the people come in exchange their paper for for straps and that was a big moment because I realized alright these trainers are skeptical lot but if they think this is really a great thing All right now I'm I'm cooking with some gas you know and and so that was kind of\nTipping point one and then shortly thereafter I started to get exposed to some athletes um and ended up connecting with a cat\nThat probably most of your listeners have heard of named Drew Brees and very early in the in his career so before he became the super bowl champion quarterback for that for the St before he became the Drew Brees that we all know to them and he was the same guy then but you just didn't know about him and he had he had just torn has his rotator cuff and his throwing shoulder\nWhich ... quarterbacks tends to be a career ender\nShoulder which for quarterbacks tends to be a career and her\nAnd he had just been released from the chargers and was doing rehab and he fell in love with the suspension trainer wow thank goodness and he had a opportunity with Sports Illustrated early on to do a story about his come back and he was very kind and you know just to sort of scratch my back\nMade sure that the picture that they featured was him training on the suspense trap and all of a sudden\nAll the strengthen conditioning coaches and athletes that reads Sports Illustrated got their eyes on this crazy strapping thought well maybe we have a couple of those ... you know the big challenge for somebody who's starting a venture and particularly if you've got a product for which there isn't precedent\nAs soon as you start to hit scale then a whole other host of challenges begins to avail themselves and you have to wrangle each one one at a time ... ... for example one of the specific challenges that I faced early was\nThe manufacturer that I had started with who was a good guy but didn't have a depth of manufacturing experience in kind of product that I was bringing which is this product has to be very durable\nAnd so one of the very early large lots of him and tore we ordered arrived\nAnd you know we'd sold out of everything so of course we're out of stock by the time it arrived in desperate to ship will we hooked up the first ... lean back in the handles just cracked like potato chips and it turns out that this manufacturer and had gone to a sub manufacturer\nThat this manufacturer and had gone to a sub manufacture and found somebody who would do\nThe sub components more cheaply and so we ended up having to manually strip these things apart set up in a basically an assembly line you know with a band saw went and got a bunch of ah the plumbing pipe from Home Depot\nAnd literally had to set up this little and you know manufacturing a plan if you will in our little office there and that was inefficient to say the least but we managed to work our way through and survived it\nSo you have this\nThis product down in the world and I would think that once you start to become successful uh there would be knock us I mean they would be other companies that that that oh well this we can just crush this guy because we can just make a similar thing and and make it cheaper or whatever\nThat that is the single biggest problem that I have faced in my career as an entrepreneur and frankly it's a it's a problem that is ...\nYou know the entire consumer products space these days um it started with us literally about six or seven years into our evolution I had somebody call me and say I think I just saw counterfeit directs I said that's impossible that's impossible right\nAnd it turned out that are in fact\nThe rise of the Internet was changing everything and it was creating an environment in which these little manufacturers over in you know rural China suddenly had visibility over products that seemed to be hot\nAbility over products that seemed to be hot\nSo if you have a one size fits all say for instance a Gucci bag or or Louis Vuitton bag\nThat has a high sale price but the perception of a low cost of goods you end up being a perfect target and we had an explosion of counterfeiting that just rolls across the market and really threatened to to cause us to fail\nCounting up how the legal battle against copycats buried Randy and fills in almost say the company you're listening to how I built this from NPR stay with us\n\nIt's nine forty this is Katie when our eighty eight point seven [noise]\nYou want to say thank you to everybody who helped support us during our fall fundraising efforts we raised a hundred and ten thousand dollars without interrupting a single program thank you so much to those of us stepped up to donate during are false and Dr we could not have done it without you thanks so much [noise]\nOn the way at the top of the hour as it happens from the Canadian broadcasting company and at eleven tonight we have the b._b._c. World Service\nYou're listening to KU when our eight point seven\nSupport for NPR comes from this station\nAnd from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed to financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement\nMore in alliance for lifetime income dot org from the ... foundation expanding opportunities in America's cities through grant making and social investing\nMore at ... dot org\nAnd from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nHey we'll come back to how I built this from NPR guy Raj\nSo it's around two thousand ten and ... is catching on with professional athletes and spreading to gyms across the country [noise] the problem is the exercise ... are also popular with counterfeiters and the knockout start eating into the company's bottom line\nSo Randy decides to hire an investigator to figure out just how many counterfeiters are out there\nAnd they found about twenty different factories scattered around China that we're all creating fake\nCounterfeit uh ... trainers wow and yeah it was it was really it was a it was a shock and it put a huge pressure on the entire business model so so how did what did you do how did you [noise] quiet he's these guys were eating into your business\nWere devouring my business I um I think that I was fortunate in that it was the early stages where people were starting on the enforcement side we're starting to get a sense that hey this counterfeiting business is bad\nTo get a sense that hey this counterfeiting business is bad and we are going to have to do something about it so customs was starting to ramp up its efforts and fortunately counterfeiting you know is a felony so\nWhen you identify them everyone wants to take them down\nUm and so we started this process of seizures in China with the cooperation at some level with Chinese police so that sort of started to subside but what replaced it was that the counterfeiters figured out\nIf we don't put this brands trademark on our product then it's technically not a counterfeit and so it becomes much harder to enforce against and that was the next big wave was the knock offs\nThat were copying our designs to the gym\nBut not calling themselves TR acts that he became an a bigger problem ... will how what happened well Amazon um and the other online marketplaces but particularly Amazon because of its scaled up became this hotbed if you will at an auction site\nFor all of these knock off vendors who would misappropriated\nAre trademarks use them in search marketing [noise]\nUh and so when you for instance guy came looking for T. R. acts on Amazon\nYou would be served up our product alongside a host of others others that are accorded the price of fits the proud because of course they're not having to spend any money to develop the market or get you there yeah we really experienced a flattening\nAnd actually a negative growth for a couple of years twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen wow as this\nGrowth for a couple of years twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen wow as this sea of knock offs a confused the market [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "How I Built This", "city": "Reno", "day": "03"}
