Massachusetts yeah basically you know they let me you know the ... well I don't know if it was a ... or something but there was one that had Idaho have a nasty light as the favorite can\n\nMaddie light\nAll right let's talk now about another thing that I Love besides Halloween candy or movies yes\nWas difficulty romantic comedies yeah I Want to run you through a few of the films that I watched over this summer a there was one movie in which to overworked assistance set their bosses up on each other\nAgain and we need to be miserable people\nThere was another movie I watched this summer where a teenage girls private love letters from mysteriously mailed to all of her crushes I think it's really cool that you think I have called inspectors in my eyes it's got\nThe letter ... then there was the\nOther one where the bride ... left at the altar so then she went on our honeymoon with her estranged father\nGot credibly drunk that night and I blacked out because\nThat's what's coming grammar hunting though the funding when all these movies are that these were all rom coms on Netflix you heard clips there from set it up to all the boys I've loved\nAnd like father have you ever watch any of those movies two or three okay which to I watched um televised I Love before of course so good and set it up yes let an awful lot lovely\nFeel retro about that\nFeel retro that unless you all I feel like\nIt stokes a particular part of my heart same same\nSo these movies along with a bunch of other rom com releases on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get some scribe has to watch from any comedies on the streaming service they even had a name for this big push they called it the summer of love nice uh and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that\nTens of millions of people watch these movies across the world this summer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love so I called up someone who's been covering the summer of a lot of very closely\nHer name is ... when I met she writes for the onions Avi club she'd been closely following the summer of love so we talked all about\nHey Glenn how are you good how are you doing I'm good thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having me super excited yet I have been kind of digging out\nFor several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer and now you didn't even now [noise]\nUm they called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nUh yeah some of that was like a menu of rom com movie is that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer a that as it turns out it's not flex reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million viewers watch and it's not even\nNumber of views that viewers so if you're like me and you watch them like four or five times a piece you can even multiply that number\nEight million people watching these wrong\nHe is you can even multiply that number\nEight eight million people watching these rom coms [laughter] my big question and first question about all of this was like what led Netflix no or think\nThat rom coms would work for them you know we've seen the movie studios and like the box office not really take the rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in theaters so knowing that trend line what made Netflix they will this might work for us\nI think they just spied on completely underserved market\nYou know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre\nAnd and comic blow across shoots\nYeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up at the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want\nLike just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you were kind of out of luck so for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only are churning out these rom coms are also\nTagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that really have been under used\nAnd it's worked out really well for them yeah why have the\nBig movie studios at the movies in theaters why they left rom coms\nLarge I think they're uh they're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more business\nPut like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more ... dollars back\nChannel with rom coms there was a a golden era you know when Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts you could just basically put Graham with anybody like I said it was on dribble up next why not mhm but then\nYou have something like Reese Witherspoon invincible on and for Christmases and it tanked yeah and these are superstars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back\nAnd it's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband than to go on to see a movie that's you know romance themes like it's going to have to be a kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free\nI'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls reruns again it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms on her and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do is spend twenty dollars and see a lovely couple ended up together river on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with a Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night you've got that going out to yeah\nI'm should we expect movie studios big movie studios are putting movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like those Netflix's summer of love and success lead to more rom coms in actual movie theaters\nThis lead to more rom coms in actual movie theaters\nUm that's an interesting question I I Do wonder about that because it'd be crazy Rich Asians did so well because we just want a you know a lovely\nMovie like that to see you later and in the story that I wrote another thing that was really prevalent we had a ton of commenters\nAnd because the question is like well why did eighty million people watch this like what is the big question I mean other than like markets or whatever people are just like more depressed we're [laughter] we're stressed out we want escapism we want you know we want like just an easy fun movie maybe we don't even want to see things one up anymore I Know that's hard to even like\n[noise] and from the John us and James all night foundation helping NPR advanced journalistic excellence in the digital age\n[noise]\nYou're listening to it spin emitted from NPR I'm Sam Sanders and wanting to our listeners this portion of the show contains descriptions of sexual abuse of minors probably not good for kids\nWe've discussed the me too movement a lot on the show me too and politics me too and how we would be two in journalism and NPR's newsroom even now we're going to talk about me too and sports and the dozens of stories you've been hearing for months\nSports and the dozens of stories we've been hearing for months about young elite athletes being abused by their coaches the doctors the mentors people they should be able to trust\nTheir reality and causing a great deal of physical mental and emotional pain in every field he he took advantage of ... and our dreams you\nThat's Olympics gold medalists alley Raisman\nShe was speaking at the trial of Larry Nassar he was convicted of sexually assaulting numerous young women under his care\nAs a former sports doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State university ... Nassar was recently sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison in the wake of Nassar's trial top Olympic officials have been forced out most recently Mary Bono resigned as the interim head of USA Gymnastics and\nAfter a lot of criticism she held that job for less than a week today you'll hear from an elite athlete who came forward with her own experience of sexual abuse in another ... former speed skater ... barrel she was sexually abused by another skater when she was just a teenager\nSo he helps drive my teammate and I to and from practice which both of our families really appreciate it\nAnd so and he would only pick me up every day and we'd frequently go to the rink and skate but you know sometimes we in other places but even if we did go to the rink and scale than there was molest station that happened before and after I mean in the parking lots of high school parking lot\nFriday was Fifteen Years old and training to be an Olympic speed skater in New York state when thirty three year old a limping medalist Andy Gable entered her life he was a skating God he quickly became brightest\nEntered her life he was a skating God he quickly became brought his mentor and helped her family out\nAs I said he used to drive my friend and I home from practice in the summer and he'd always drop her off first\nThan I mean I can picture clear as day back out of her driveway go down the street stops I take a right and you go to my house and it was like that every time and then one time at that same stops on he took a left and he went to the um a few streets over and there was a dead end\nWhich in hindsight it's interesting that he knew that there was a dead end there was a dead end he pulled the car over took office he ... he turned to me and he said can I guess you would have had a minimum I\nSaid nothing I just sat there [noise] um I\nWill sit here and honestly say I did not say no and an open door to not run away\nBut I was frozen yeah I mean people say there's fight or flight but there's free\nAnd that's what happened and I remember after that when we put our seatbelts on and turn the car around I remember just being like a fog or a I mean now now we have an especially I was like W. A. T. S. [laughter] yeah you know and run shock probably ... percent\nAnd only ... how would I tell anyone who would believe me what proof have\nWhy would anyone believes that he would do you know I mean just um and it wasn't violent in what we think of as traditional violence so he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a windowless fan huh\nSo he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a window as fan ... you know all that that we pretend to make these people will be so yeah that I mean honestly God that is a day my life changed\nHe would keep doing this in in the ... the the contact\nBecome more intense but yeah so so people will say you know like what is what do I mean when I say molested so to\nAnswer that awkward question on any I never had sex\nAnd the traditional um definition of sex but basically the legal terms is digital penetration um and he would put my hand on himself when he was wrecked um [noise] and you are touched and follow me and I was Fifteen and he was thirty three\nWhile Andy is taken advantage of you do see also like getting close to your family at the same time\nI'm very much so so ah he [noise] he had um a growing issue was skating and so he saw my father for his doctor for that and\nMy mom he came over to the house a couple of times and I took piano lessons from my mom oh my goodness yeah\nSo how are you in your house for example wasn't from your mother you knew what he was doing to she did not know wow so how did that feel\nI don't even know I mean\nI think it it was such a time of confusion and I\nConfusion and I was so dedicated to wanting to skate that I didn't have any other currency you know I didn't have any\nAnything to barter I didn't have money I didn't have 'em anything the only thing\nThat he wanted for me was my ... slot body I'm and I'm about it was it so confusing because\nLike I said he wasn't violence with me\nAnd she took care of my skates which is very very very time consuming\nAmir blades they're not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there is something they're not straight they're bent to go left and the offset and so as especially as a kid like myself gets better and better and better I mean the improvement\nCurve is is pretty deep as a kid and so I'm\nAs you're getting better the all of those metrics have to change and for the Nineteen Ninety eight Olympic trials sort of a winter club had a lot of athletes competing I mean we sent more people to the Olympic trials than the national training programs sent to the Olympic trials\nSo our coach you also was volunteer had a full time job\nAnd a family um he and he took care of my blades and I mean our coach Andy and other top skaters are higher priority so he helped me out and a lot of ways my mother said if you want to go to a skating find a ride to the rank\nAnd Andy was my ride [noise] do do you think\nAnd Andy was my ride [noise]\nDo do you think she ever thought that he was your boyfriend did you think at Fifteen that he was like something approaching a boyfriend\nI definitely did because\nI didn't know what else that could be yeah um because he was kind to me in and gave me things um you know bought me things about me gifts brought me out to dinner I mean some things that seems silly and trivial to someone like just stop for a second\nI\nI didn't have a driver's license yeah I couldn't go anywhere\nI'm I\nMowing lawns in the summer\nThat's how I had enough money to offset my skating my parents put up a lot of money and I had to contribute [laughter]\nIt's not inappropriate for kids to kiss and fool around and experiment when they're Fifteen with other Fifteen year old kids you're right but\nSo that's what was so confusing about at all also took was part of the reason it took me so long to come forward and talk about it because\nFor so long it it was and it still is it's gray two things one so again I was in the tenth grade and that was when we had homecoming dance and I wanted to go with actually my date lived down the street from Andy one block away\nAnd um he said that I could quote go he let me go I'm so long as as soon as I came home I called him I couldn't go down after party I can go to anything I had to come directly home and so I told the group of friends\nDirectly home and so I told the group of friends I was going with than my day and ever and I said I'm you know I have practice in the morning so I'm just after the dancing going to go home and I was like oh that's cool yeah we figured that it fine but it was because he was controlling yeah when I told my parents mom we pick me up you know the station ... station wagon\nA role in my school parking lots pick me up and brought me home and no one thought anything of it and I have one of those\nMemories in my brain of being in my bedroom\nHad twin beds in my bedroom and this yellow\nBedside table between the two of them in this phone was there and I remember being kind of under the covers and no one could hear me picking up the phone dialing his phone number and being like I Am home\n[noise] [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "city": "Reno", "day": "28"}
