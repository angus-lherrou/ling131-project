minute here with two guests today Chris guiding her legal editor bus be news how busy as your week been\nIt's been a week we but we we have a lot of\nThose recently so that is true that is true awfully or with Elena sell your business correspondent for NPR guessing you're we've been pretty busy as well ... well I'm so glad you both made the time to talk with me to wrap up the week of news\nAnd I'm so glad to be playing the song with I'm playing for you both are right now it is a new well old but new prince\nSong is called Seventeen Days\nThe day you\nKnow he like I'm already ready for the weekend just listening to write that one voice on the\nSo this is from an album of old prince demos that was released late last month the album is called piano and the microphone Nineteen eighty three and it's these nine and release prince demos from way back then\nAnd so the thing about this is that like these aren't like finished versions of these songs because of the demos a scratch tracks just prints at the piano playing the songs to show his band and his team how they want to do the songs with the full band later and they're just really interesting moment and Nissan but\nYou can hear we're prints starts to beat box to basically show the drummer how he wants to Trump's this out\nOr how he wants to Trump's this out [noise]\nIt's just amazing and so but what's so weird about this that like because these are demos there are big questions as to whether or not want to just released right also famously fought streaming services like YouTube and spot of five so the fact that you can hear these songs on those platforms\nIt's weird I feel guilty hearing this stuff but I also love it yeah I mean I think that that's one of those those things it's sort of like your journalists a instinct is like yes we want to see this\nPeople must know but what he wanted people to know exactly\nWhere\n\nAnyway Alina and Chris er here with me to look back on the week of news and culture and everything else first we're going to start by having each of my gas and me to describe our weekly news and only three words ... you had been\nCovering the opening of the Supreme Court term this week you've seen the current justices back on the bench you go first\nI mean we were in this a strange position again of violence starting out as Supreme Court term with only eight justices and that the thing was that within the court like\nAnd finding Amazon like he's been coming out for a while now to reduce the bill that's called stop basis act a you know that no [laughter] yeah\nAnd on Tuesday when Amazon came out with this announcement I talked to Senator Sanders and his line was I got to give credit where credit's due and Amazon and Jeff Bezos made the right call it's a good decision so it's\nYes PR is definitely part of it and another really huge element to all of this is that the economy\nIs presenting an extremely tight labor market there are more job openings than workers and Amazon is heading into this season um holidays are coming up they're going to be fighting for these workers they that they need but also Walmart needs and\nBest Buy needs and all these other retailers need and you know having a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in this this bumping 'em coverage of that I'm sure it can't\nHurt helps them attract workers while I can talk about Amazon all day is you know [laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nSo I just signed for break or when we come back I'm going to talk with two high school students in Texas and their friends nominated them to be on the home of course a but they're both young women in this set up a bit of a firestorm and later my conversation with film director hike Baron hope he turned his politically charged Thanksgiving\nShe turned his

I asked them about their homecoming story or the your average teenagers in the high school band Sicilia plays ... stories in the color guard so where are you both now\nOur gross hiding in a corner or near an all [laughter]\nSo fun fact I also was in marching band when I was in high school I Am from Texas I'm just about an hour south of you guys night where did you go I went to a jets in high school for two years into Clemens high school\nWhere did you go I went to a jets in high school for two years into Clemens high school in shirts for it to you know I was a saxophone player I was a drum major so I'm having fond fond font thoughts of my days hiding in the corner and we\nActually played jets and at a competition on Saturday\nReally small world small world yeah [laughter]\nThe Syrian story there are a couple and their friends nominated them to be on the homecoming court\nWe just want to say just want the opportunity to win together or we didn't have to come together but I mean we didn't even have the chance for at least originally we did it\nSo do you want it to run on the homecoming court as a king but the school administration told her that only boys can be teens and only girls can be queens\nCecilia and stories said that this made it impossible for a gay couple to actually win together they push back in the school actually changed the rules that same day they decided to have no gender the titles in the homecoming contest no ... no queens\nOn the homecoming courts would just be known as quote royals but that didn't make facilities in story happy\nI mean it's definitely a step forward it's another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples\nStory how do you feel about this\nThey think they were over compensating rather than just reading and that well it shouldn't have been at a gym there they should have just made it so you are voting ... regardless of gender that just shows whether or not they were now that the chain\nOr green or anything between and it was up to that it wasn't up to that school and we're going to take out come on circuit check out check your guest one couple wants to run together\nA spokesperson for the school told us quote we can say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one\nCan say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one often independent school district is committed to creating a safe supportive environment for all students and staff including those who identify as algae be teach you plus since the changes sodium story happened dealing with the fall out\nOf the students support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much the same way as we are when they say that they don't think that this court did what they should have done they don't like the new policy it isn't that what home coming is\nTo post ... about um outside Austin ... what are hearing about it that comment on why they're not very positive\nWhat's been the worst kind of comments\nThat originally basically saying that we're that we're not we're snowflakes rational or special treatment and that is exactly what they would have expected to electing a same sex couple is not ... how would come after the house\nPeople really think is going to ruin homecoming\nMobile ended up taking away the whole homecoming tradition\nGotcha is they're going to be other stuff that you all go through throughout this year are you a senior year right yeah that will have to I mean like there's probably going to be\nOther gender roles for other senior year traditions as well my kids are gonna be a situation when it comes to prom king and queen what happens next uh\nYes actually that's one of the teachers that has been talking joy throughout this whole issue venture backed off and land jumped she was like and I can't wait until we get to Prague either I\nUsed to be running for prom king and queen how that turned out my goodness so there may be more drama I had before the years done [laughter] please [noise]\nIt'd be pseudonym limits of soda and stories they've been dealing with this fall out some students support than others don't like the outcome the votes actually aren't done yet that's going to happen next week but this story really made\nMe think like Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for Texas but for the country\nAnd so you have the school administration that is trying to in some way be an ally to these young women but even they can't figure out what the right language is what the right term should be I think\nWe're in this period where defining and letting gender roles be more fluid can be confusing for some\nPeople I I just celebrated my forte first birthday and one of the things that I've learned is like that means that I'm getting older and\nI'm not going to necessarily understand how a younger group of people is looking at things and I mean we could have been having the same conversation Twenty years ago and somebody saying like\nThey're trying to be supportive why aren't they okay with just being known as friends why why why do we need to talk about the fact that they're a gay couple and\nThat they're together like that's like talking about their sex lives there has have always been these issues about how we use language in what it means and\nNPR's Alina Selyukh a business correspondent for NPR I'm I Know

some point maybe you like me said to yourself at that table well dang\nThis could be a movie I should have pitched that screenplay because now that storyline is a movie and it's coming out this month the movie is called the oh it is directed by and stars I Baron hopes he's an actor an improv comedian who you may have seen before I'd\nBaron Hill to best known for his role on the Mindy project he plays the weird and lovable nurse Morgan Tucker's uh I also started and HBO's east bound and down and back in the day he was on ...

town now you know they get Peron makeup done a lot of makeup done and us\nWhen we're ... we go uh you know it's it's it's fun to go and you always see some fans are and stuff so it it is fun and exhilarating but it also it was fun to kind of come home at the end of the night and you could talk about it and stuff\nWas this one different because it was your first and directing the movie can definitely I'm always just kind of you know an actor for usually so when you go which you know you're proud of the movie you're not proud of the movie but it's just a small part of it and\nYou can either take as much credit or have kind of you know no accountability and you just kind of show up for the party and stuff but for this one because it is\nThis movie is so kind of a personal to me it's something I'm working on for for almost a year I said yeah this is this I'm going to give it all yeah\nYeah I could tell they were working I was working with him I was talking to everyone you got you got any kind of German so let's describe this film for our listeners without sport largest weather's\nSo if you can imagine a politically charged America that is incredibly divided can imagine that uh\nA politically charged America that is incredibly divided and imagine that uh but I but there's there's a there's a presidential administration that's that's obsessed with loyalty\nAnd they have introduced state it's not compulsory but it's a highly suggested um loyalty oath [laughter]\nSo ah the deadline to sign it is the uh Friday after Thanksgiving Black Friday everyone's favorite holiday [laughter] yeah and so the whole movie takes place during that we can Thanksgiving and and my character Chris uh\nIs very liberal and very upset about what's going on and very into consumed by the twenty four hour news cycle\nAnd his wife is Tiffany Haddish [noise] uh the characters ... she's played by Tiffany Haddish I don't I Would also kind of like in the middle of it has to go to prepare for girls trip exactly that would be kinda cool yeah and she's kind of you know\nTrying to keep the family together and just trying to do her best to keep going forward and we have everyone coming to the house mom dad brother ... brother conservative brother a slightly left of center sister kind of the whole family's all over the map and\nThe first kind of half of the movie\nIs really all about you know try and your best to not talk about politics at the holiday table yes let's leave it there let's leave it there yeah did your family Thanksgiving inspire this at all it actually did a it was right the Thanksgiving right after the twenty sixteen election how hot one it was a hot one that people didn't know what to say they were all shell shock yeah\nAnd that for dinner the three of us kind of gotten his argument and there was a little bit of wine involved but you know what struck me about the argument was that we were all on the same side we all voted for the same person rather enthusiastically Mm I think my brother has kind of position he was a little more of a Bernie Sanders\nSee my brother has kind of position he was a little more of a Bernie Sanders guy and I think his position was you know will burn it could have won this [noise] and you know my mom lives in in South central Ohio and she was saying well they forgot about the mid west they gave up the mid west which is ridiculous and I was kind of like well it's ... fault and this\nAnd it just struck me that if we're also aligned and novel and ... and we're fighting what's going on to their tables around the country and and so I I knew that that arena would be like a really fun area for us to explore and I knew it can be funny and potentially explosive\nYeah what I Love about the movie and you miss 'em that it it it it makes us all think about how and when and how much we should talk about politics\nI covered the last election in my ... him oh throughout was like people to talk about it more because of this stuff shapes the nation and we put the hard stuff to the side are only preached to the choir here to talk about more but now\nI'm usually like everyone just shut a thing I was like\nYou I was the guy for a good year and a half that\nSit down at dinner with some friends first and talk about can you believe that this is insane and I did that thing where I was like I don't understand how people are not talking about it is what is bigger what's the bigger news story and you're in my lifetime that were happening now there's not one night and so I I I was getting frustrated at people's\nFrustration with me talking about it and what I I recently\nI recently started trying to find that balance a little bit and like if you are just are just on Twitter all day and you're just you're just raise your blood pressure raises your blood pressure and I think you know when I wrote the movie I was like I Want to put myself in the head of Chris my character who really\nLike I Want to put myself in the head of Chris my character who really as obsessive and he's consumed by the cycle so I had to CNN Fox News or MSNBC on twenty four\nReally and I was reading it
