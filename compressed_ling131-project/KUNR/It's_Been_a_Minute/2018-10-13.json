T. Q. community to them back when Bob grew up in the sixties you could get locked up for even going to a gay bar it was a very different times so Bob's first coming out actually wasn't until Nineteen Seventy four after\nHe just had his first same sex experience by told his best friend who he thought might also be gay\nI was in his apartment and it took me forever to work up to it I I was [noise] are sitting there and [noise] I was taking deep breath and I was trembling\nLet's take a deep breath and I was trembling [noise] um but what I said was I'm gay [laughter] I acted him to say so am I in fall into my arms and what he actually said was\nTwice in one week who\n[laughter] well that was\nGoing to react and how they're somebody else beat me to this [laughter] um but at an event you know when I was coming out we didn't have a models\nIn public discourse there were no models for gay people on the generous hadn't come out of a TV [noise] and ah the will and grace was far in the future and so um I think it's a different world than I I hear about\nPeople coming out at the age of twelve and I think\nThe lord I was never that brave I mean you never in the world and I don't really know what it would be like today to do that\nI don't know either I mean I remember my process and it literally Bob it took me years just to look at myself in the mirror and say the words I Am gay it took me years to do that okay now if I can turn this interview on its head why\nI oh God well some of the reasons I was so much younger than I Am way what I'm suggesting is you're ... you're coming out of the different period and it\nYeah so yeah I mean I was raised in a church where it was you went to help for it uh yeah yeah like totally okay that is different and they try and you know they they were points in my life where folks in the church tried to pray it away or I tried to pray at all\n[noise]\n[noise]\nLike when you're going to drown income [noise]\n\nComing out in Nineteen Ninety seven ... what's changed since then [noise] plus more with professor Marci Gallo after break I'm Sam Sanders you're listening to it's been a minute for NPR good evening this is Katie when our eighty eight point seven\nMm Mm [noise] ...\nWe get support from our town presenting complex ... from ... to ... the innovative dance company reinventing the art of dance through a groundbreaking mix of styles it's an art town experience October twenty first at the pioneer center tickets at ... center dot com Mm\nMm\nWeather for the local area overnight clear skies and lose the thirty three [noise] sunny and nice tomorrow highs around sixty seven sunny and nice on Sunday as well but temps a little bit cooler eyes near fifty two on Sunday for the local county area\nMm Mm\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the NPR One club everyone comes with a story including NPR inspired bottles like weekend edition cabernet available to adults Twenty one years or older learn more at NPR wine club dot org\n[noise] from the corporation for public broadcasting and the state of Joan crock who's request serves as an enduring investment in the future of ...\nState of Joan crock who's ... serves as an enduring investment in the future of public radio [noise] and from the William T grand foundation a W T grant foundation dot org\nWe are back you're listening to it's been a minute for NPR I'm Sam Sanders\n[noise] this week we're talking about national coming out day this past Thursday October eleventh we're looking at some big moment in coming out history and hearing the stories from listeners I've been talking to Marcy Gallo she's a professor at\nUniversity of Nevada Las Vegas just talking to me through the history of coming out and you can't really talk about that history without talking about this one big moment\nYeah it was a big deal uh she took a big big big risk and we'll are a lot\nThat's Marcy discussing Ellen in Nineteen Ninety seven on her ABC sitcoms\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nI remember in the year I was like Thirteen ... and I remember I don't think my parents told me not to watch but I knew that I shouldn't watch wow that make the ... and I and I probably saw later or not to to see it but I remember how big of a deal it was for this woman to come out\nOn her prime time TV show to her therapist who was at that time played by Oprah [laughter]\nOh God I remember that that old I remember\nRight right exactly and it's not like I'm looking for perfection you know I just I just want somebody special somebody you know that I I click with and obviously you didn't click with Richard\nDurham has there ever been any\nSo you didn't click with Richard Durham has there ever been any one use cells you clicked with them\nAnd what was his name from citizen [noise]\nThey both have the young ... [laughter]\nI don't know I as I thought if I just ignored it you know just go away and I can just live a normal life\nAnd what is a normal life Ellen no normal\nI mean just the same thing everybody wants to my house and picket fence you know a donned the cat Sunday barbecues ... someone who loves me when I can build a life with just\nI just want to be happy and you think you can have these things with a woman well\nAs I had a pretty big problem with it you know there there are a lot of people out there I think people like me are sick\nSo I mean coming out has been a thing at this point for a few decades and one of the backlash that she face ...\nWas pretty I lost a show all this conservative groups urged companies to not buy ads on the show ABC actually put an adult content warning on episodes of Alan that showed a woman kissing a woman\nThere was even coverage that if you listen back to you from NPR that I find it hard to imagine airing um snow in April in Nineteen Ninety seven [noise]\nThe afternoon before that episode aired of Ellen a Robert Knight who was then the head of the family Research Council he talked to NPR about this and you just got to hear it\nYou see there is an agenda here to normalize homosexuality all the good characters are upbeat you know free speech\nHis homosexuality all the good characters are upbeat you know free spirits wonderful people and of course a lot of gay people are like that\nBut not all of them and and yet it it seems to me that they are doing their best to present homosexuality or something desirable normal something you ought to try kids or you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there is no right and wrong in this issue\nOr the only right thing to do is embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise is a terrible bigots wow\nWow [noise] it's so funny he says there's an agenda here to normalize homosexuality it's\nLike yeah yeah yeah the appointment [laughter] the whole he hate kids it's okay you can try to um it was fascinating to hear it 'cause that's of course what they were terrified about it it would get normalize that there would be acceptance um\nAnd I frankly I think we're still fighting that fight quite honestly\nAnd can I jump up and I know we're going decade by decade I'll do it go ahead but you know I ... for today I was looking at a Washington Post opinion piece you might have already seen it I'm like academic I'm Matt Brickell wrote this really interesting piece in the Washington Post last October eleventh\nIs when it appeared um and he sets off a brain blow flag waving firestorm really of protest when he says\nDon't come out you say people like clear people stopped coming out\nDo we get back on from Nineteen Ninety seven Allen coming out and it's a big deal to twenty Seventeen Twenty years later I'm or we don't do a academic saying don't do it what is the rationale behind [laughter]\nOh we don't do it academic St don't do it what is the rationale behind [laughter] okay\nSo for one and this is debatable America this is a quote America's a safer place in twenty Seventeen\nOn people secondly though and even more kind of convincing in some ways he's arguing that are having to come out reinforces the view that heterosexuality still is the norm\nYou know I'm paraphrasing he's you know we have to proclaim my sexuality right and we need a national holiday to do it but they don't wear as head of sexuality is normal and expected and he says everyone should come out or no one should\nMaybe heterosexual people should come out on October eleventh and say I'm straight and but he is arguing that our sexuality is no way to organize our judgments about people\nAnd that no particular sexuality should be the expected default\nSpeaking of the ways that things have just become more fluid I'm thinking of the ways that celebrities come out now you know and you think of the R. and B. singer Frank Ocean and she came out but he never use the word gay right you know you think about Jodie Foster Amos the kind of came out a Globes we actually have paper\nThat\nUnderneath your support on the [noise]\nYes\nI think I already did my coming out about a thousand years ago back in the\nStone age and that was\nWith open up the trust us\nA young girl with open up the trust of friends and family co workers and then gradually probably to everyone who knew her everyone should actually\nBut apparently I'm told that every celebrity is expected to honor the details of their private\nLife without press conference a fragrance that are friends I\nHave a point in my mind goes should have a point should we be forced should anybody be forced to like do the coming out in the way that people say you're supposed to be coming out yeah and\nSee this is where we go back to it being both a personal and political choice\nAnd I think the personal has to come first and I think that you don't you and I know the the list of celebrities who we all sort of wink wink you know amount\nAnd you really want to come out and who flirt with that much like foster did um and then for whatever reasons whether it's to ... um whether it's just they don't want to be pigeonholed you know\nThey decide not to or they don't yet or they wait or whatever and I think I think there's gotta be room for that too I Do I care more about whether people get in a way of social change or\nAged somebody is down with the struggle if they are helping the movement however they want to do it whether it's overt or covert [noise] I think the choice of whether they command is up to them [noise]\n\nOn Sunday October twenty first seven PM at Reno little theater\nAt Sunday between the first seven PM at Reno little theatre and jazz with the Mike male

never just one day and\nHow it's different for different people born in in this next segment you'll hear a gay slur I've been talking with e Patrick Johnson the head of the African American studies department at Northwestern university and he told me how coming out can change when you're from a marginalized background\nI'm Talking about black people brown people because people\nWhoever where you live a gay life\nBut you don't talk about it and maybe there isn't a coming out day where you tell everyone [laughter] folks know and and and like other folks don't [laughter] this feels to me\nTo be a thing but it's much more of a thing for gay people who are not white and my rights and yes yeah and yeah and if you are already\nHailed as and you fill in the blank in terms of your rights or a black person I'd like to ...\nA a black person I like to next person Asian person\nAnd that brings with it a whole set of responses to who you are as a person and so you in some ways don't have\nAny choice but to\nLive with that because you you can hide it [noise] mhm and I especially feel that way I'm for African Americans in particular because of the\nConnection to the church mhm you couldn't go to any black church in the United states and not find a game in ... a whole ... of them yes um\nAnd it's a complicated place because I grew up in the church and the church is actually where I feel I came into my own\nAt work I mean I felt safe there like as a young black boy in the church was the one place I knew I wasn't going to be made fun of correct but it was also the one place where I knew that I might hear the word faggot over the pulpit mhm there was this weird dichotomy but I always felt in this weird way safe there yeah I mean\nThe churches where I was encouraged to um express myself which you know I was a big old clean love 'em and and the choirs than a singing soprano the only way over ... parental section\nAnd I'm sure they ended up I'm sure they loved it they should be in that yet at the same time the pastor was talking about gay folks going to hell in God gave you age because you've sent ... ... not in my church that I thought okay that [laughter] but many charges were doing many uh\nAnd that [laughter] but many charges were doing many a absolute and still do and ... and so yeah it it's a really a\nConcert [laughter] ... yeah no but that that's part of the other thing but also you know we also had the whole down low a phenomena and also we should stop to define what the downloads for those who might not know\nYes so men who are on the down low are men who sleep with men but who do not attend a fight as gay\nAnd they're usually black they only allowed to fail for men other than black men\nYes I'm even though that's not true\n[laughter] well I mean like you have these euphemisms for like white men they as a double life you know yeah the lead a double life yeah why does it say about what coming out has become where you move from Harvey\nMilk in the seventies coming out day in the eighties to acceptance for folks like Alan by the nineties yet at the same time this subset of the community black man they're still being labeled with this term deal\nSo at the same time that yes\nThere was a part of the community that we're not being opened there was another part that was actually being\nVery open Jay in the seventies in particular there were a radical group of of black in Latin next lesbians\nWere open and pushing things forward and and it was that wing of pushing back against the second wave feminism movement was white ...\nThis movement was white straight middle class women and these black can lead to next lesbians like hello I'm we're here as well and so people like Audrey lord a serene Morocco Gloria and so do uh\nI could go on and on and all of these black lesbians yeah and like lesbians\nSo it's a complicated history is not just that black folk sort of disavow coming out of being open about their sexuality or in total some make that decision [laughter] but then there was a whole other set who made another choice\nThat choice can be very challenging for all kinds of marginalized people take on ... rye is there another listener who shared a coming out story with us on a as twenty five from Plymouth, Minnesota on his parents are Catholic immigrants from Mexico two and a half years ago and he came out to family and friends as clear\nTheir parents reacted okay not great but okay but on the has the second coming out story about coming out to themselves as transgender\nI was in college and I in one of my high cost of a Microsoft or had brought in a trench she's a trans woman who is just like kind of sharing her story a guy I was like raised to be a only strong and like no softness and\nUm and I always felt like something was wrong but like compensated by being like in the military and I got a wife and I can and like all this stuff and and I never gave my face to really like\nAsk myself and really like think\nWho I Am\nI Would like to have you back in my chair and I always did in class and [noise] um I was just kind of mine that I ran out of it like\nI was like back in my chair and I always good to ah in class and I'm just kind of mine that I ran out of it [laughter] like giving yourself if they ask yourself [noise] I've never done that before interesting and sort of put his myself that question I was like\nOkay well I Am I on it and like almost fell out of my chair [laughter] because I like the answer was no\n\nRecently wrote a letter to their mom and dad to explain this saying they were considering top surgery a double mastectomy on his parents got really hung up on that\nSame kind of got stuck on the idea that like oh this is a a\nCosmetic issue and or like an aesthetic issue and it's like I just something you don't like about your body and I don't know I have I and everybody like things about their body we used to like\nMake our way through life and we just have to learn to love ourselves and it was like well there's a difference between that and and feeling like I mean dissociative with your with like a body part and it's like\nI don't know like something feels like genuinely wrong\nAnd so I\nKind of made it clear that like it doesn't matter if you understand it and I felt like it doesn't matter if you kind of respect and honor my autonomy on that and that was something like that\nYeah the other night we'd like Saturday Night than as going off to bed and my dad called out I mean and it sounds like fun again tonight and thanks for being yourself\n\nI mean maybe none of them are really under stand in that but I'm Still a cat and um yeah and we still on each other\nThat was on the rise in Minnesota their story highlights how coming out today can be much more complex than what Elon did Twenty one years ago professor ... Patrick Johnson told me it's more complex now for celebrities to like Janelle Monday isn't it\nLike Janelle Monet or is it an example because she didn't\nCome out as gay or it was something much more fluid\nAnd I think we're in a moment of trans notice and gender non conforming aid that is really influencing how people announced their sexuality and so it's much more ... than a I'm coming out because I like the same sex it's more like well\nI'm not heterosexual [laughter] yeah well and like she said that she opened me was I think pan sexual and this guy sometimes in the girl times and the people that are not going for me and I'm also thinking the same vein of someone like Frank Ocean who like kind of came out but in actuality never ever used the word gay\nCorrect because it's I think in the moment we're in now it's not about limiting oneself to an identity", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "city": "Reno", "day": "13"}
