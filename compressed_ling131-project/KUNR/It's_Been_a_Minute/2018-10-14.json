October eleven that was national coming out day\nThis year is the thirtieth anniversary of that day and a thing I always think every year around this time is it never just one day coming out happens differently\nIs it never just one day coming out happens differently for every one of the more than once and for some of us it seems like that process never really ends case in\nPoint my friend Bob Mondello film critic for NPR's all things considered how old are you Bob I turned Seventy next year shut up no really so okay what year did you come out\n[noise] that's a hard question to answer do you mean to myself do you mean to my folks to mean to my friends do you mean I I it depends what you're talking okay well\nYou see what I'm saying I today on the show we're going to explore the history of coming out and coming out day I was how it came to be how it's changed over time\nAnd what it means for the algae Beatty cue community to them but I like when Bob grew up in the sixties you could get locked up for even going to a gay bar it was a very different times so Bob's first coming out actually wasn't until Nineteen Seventy four after\nHe just had his first same sex experience Bob told his best friend who he thought might also be gay\nI was in his apartment and it took me forever to work up to it I I was sitting there and [noise] I was taking a deep breath and I was trembling [noise] um but what I said was I'm gay\n[laughter] I acted him to say so am I fall into my arms and what he actually said was twice in one week who\n[laughter] well I always\nMy reaction how dare somebody else beat me to this um but at an event you know when I was coming out we didn't have a models in public discourse\nA models in public discourse there were no models for gay people owns a generous hadn't come out of a TV [noise] and ah the will and grace was far in the future and so um I think it's a different world than I I hear about\nPeople coming out at the age of twelve and I think could lord I was never that brave I mean never in the world and I don't really know what it would be like today to do that\nI don't know either I mean I remember my process and it literally Bob it took me years just to look at myself in the mirror and say the words I Am gay they took me years to do that okay now if I can turn this interview on it said why\nI oh God well some of the reasons I was so much younger than I Am way what I'm suggesting is you're ... you're coming out of the different period and it\nYeah so yeah I mean I was raised in a church where it was you went to hell for it

listening to it's been a minute for NPR I'm Sam Sanders\n[noise] this week we're talking about national coming out this past Thursday October eleventh we're looking at some big moments in coming out history and everything coming out stories from listeners I've been talking to Marcy Gallo she's a professor\nComing out stories from listeners I've been talking to Marcy Gallo she's a professor at University of Nevada Las Vegas you're talking to me through the history of coming out and you can't really talk about that history without talking about this one big moment yeah it was a\nBig deal uh she took a big big big risk and we'll her a lot that's Marcy discussing Ellen in Nineteen Ninety seven on ABC sitcoms [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nI remember this year I was like Thirteen ... and I remember I don't think my parents told me not to watch but I knew that I shouldn't watch wow that make the ... and I and I probably thought later it's not just to see it but I remember how big of a deal it was for this woman to come out\nOn her prime time TV show to her therapist who was at that time played by Oprah\n[laughter] oh God I remember that old I remember\nRight exactly and it's not like I'm looking for perfection you know I just I just want somebody special somebody you know that I I click with and obviously you didn't click with Richard\nDurham has there ever been any one use cells you click with them\nAnd what was his name is [noise]\nThey both for younger women like she's from [laughter]\nI don't know I as I thought if I just ignored it you know just go away and I can just live a normal life\nAnd what is a normal life Ellen no normal I mean just the same thing\nYou know normal I mean just the same thing everybody wants to my house and picket fence you know Don cat Sunday barbecues I mean a lot of someone who loves me when I can build a life with just want to be happy\nAnd you think you can't have these things with a woman\nWell it's I had a pretty big problem with it you know there are a lot of people out there I think people like me are sick\nSo I mean coming out has been a thing at this point for a few decades among the backlash that she face was pretty ... lost his show all these conservative groups urged companies to not buy ads\nOn the show ABC actually put an adult content warning on episodes of Alan that showed a woman kissing a woman\nThere was even coverage that if you listen back to you from NPR that I find it hard to imagine airing um snow in April in Nineteen Ninety seven\nThe afternoon before that episode aired of Alan a Robert Knight who was then the head of the family Research Council he talked to NPR about this and you just got to hear it\nSo you see there is an agenda here to normalize homosexuality all the gay characters are upbeat you know free spirits wonderful people and of course a lot of gay people are like that but not all of them and and yet it it seems to me that they are doing their best present homosexuality or something desirable normal something you ought to try kids\nOr you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there's no right and wrong in this issue\nOr the only right thing to do is embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise is a terrible biggest\nWow wow [noise]\nWow wow [noise]\nIt's so funny she says there's an agenda your to normalize homosexuality\nIt's like yeah yeah yeah the appointment [laughter] the whole he hate kids it's okay you can try to um it was fascinating to hear because that's of course what they were terrified about it it would get normalize that there would be acceptance um\nAnd I frankly I think we're still fighting that fight quite honestly\nAnd can I jump up and I know we're going decade by decade outdoors go ahead but you know I ... for today I was looking at a Washington Post opinion piece you might have already seen it I'm like academic I'm Matt Brickell wrote this really interesting piece in the Washington Post last October eleventh\nIs when it appeared um and he sets off a brain blow flag waving firestorm really of protest when he says\nDon't come out you say people like clear people stopped coming out\nAnd get back on from Nineteen Ninety seven Ellen coming out and it's a big deal to twenty Seventeen Twenty years later I'm don't do it academically and don't do it what is the rationale behind [laughter] okay\nSo for one and this is debatable America is is a quote America's a safer place than twenty Seventeen\nOn people secondly though and even more kind of convincing in some ways he's arguing that are having to come out reinforces the view that heterosexuality still is the norm [noise]\nNo I'm paraphrasing he's you know we have to proclaim sexuality right\nHe's you know we have to proclaim my sexuality right and we need a national holiday to do it but they don't whereas right head of sexuality is normal and expected and he says everyone should come out for no one should\nMaybe heterosexual people should come out on October eleventh and say I'm straight and but he is arguing that our sexuality is no way to organize our judgments about people\nAnd that no particular sexuality should be the expected default\nSpeaking of the ways that things have just become more fluid I'm thinking of the ways that celebrities come out now you know you think an R. and B. singer Frank Ocean and she came out but he never use the word gay right you know do you think about Jodie Foster mislead kind of came out a Globes we actually have paper\nThat [noise]\nYes I\nThink I already did my coming out about a thousand years ago back in the\nStone age and [noise]\nWould open up the trust of\nFriends and family co workers and then gradually probably to everyone who knew her everyone's you're actually\nBut now apparently I'm told that every celebrities expected to honor the details of their private\nLife without press conference or fragrance at a friends I\nHave a point I might go should have a point should we be forced to anybody be forced to like do the coming out in the way that people say you're supposed to do the coming out yeah now see this is where we go back to it\nAnd see this is where we go back to it being both a personal and political choice\nAnd I think the personal has to come first and I think that you don't you and I know the the list of celebrities who we all sort of wink wink you know amount\nAnd you really want to come out and who flirt with it much like for us to did um and then for whatever reasons whether it's familiar will um whether it's just they don't want to be pigeonholed you know\nThey decide not to or they don't yet or they wait or whatever and I think I think there's got to be room for that too I Do I care more about whether\nPeople get in the way of social change or eight at somebody is down with the struggle if they are helping the movement however they want to do it whether it's overt or covert and\n[noise] I think the choice of whether they command is up to them [noise]\n\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from life ... life luck with Norton works to help protect identities and the information on devices from cyber

Gloria and so do uh\nI could go on and on and all of these black lesbians yeah and like you know lesbians\nSo it's a complicated history is not just that black folk sort of disavow coming out\nThat black folk sort of disavow coming out of being open about their sexuality or in total some make that decision but then there was a whole other set who made another choice\nThat's always can be very challenging for all kinds of marginalized people take on ... riots there another listener who shared a coming out story with us on a as twenty five from Minnesota on his parents are Catholic immigrants from Mexico two and a half years ago and he came out to family and friends as clear\nTheir parents reacted okay not great but okay but on the has the second coming out story about coming out to themselves as transgender\nI was in college and I in one of my classes on my professor had brought in a trench she's a trans woman who is just like kind of sharing her story is a guy as like raised to be only strong and like no softness and\nUm and I always felt like something was wrong but like compensated by eating like in the military and I got a wife and I can I call this stuff and on and I never gave my face to really like\nAsk myself centrally like think\nAbout who I Am\nLike have you back in my chair and I always did that in class and I'm just kind of mine that I ran out of it [laughter] like giving yourself a space\nAnd ask yourself [noise] I've never done that before interesting and then I put his myself that question I was like okay well I Am I on it and I like almost fell out of my chair [laughter] because I like the answer was no [noise]\n\nRecently wrote a letter to their mom and dad to explain this saying they were considering top surgery a double mastectomy on his parents got really hung up on that\nThey kind of got stuck on the idea that like oh this is a a cosmetic issue and or\nOn his parents got really hung up on that\nSame kind of got stuck on the idea that like oh this is a a\nCosmetic issue and or like an aesthetic issue and it's like I just something you don't like about your body and I don't like I have I and everybody to like think about their body reached oh like\nMake our way through life and we just after ... lovers house and it was like well there's a difference between that and and feeling like I mean dissociative with your with like a body art and like\nI don't know like something feels like genuinely wrong\nAnd so I\nKind of made it clear that like it doesn't matter if you understand or not but like it doesn't matter if you kind of respect and honor my autonomy on that and not something they said\nYeah the other end and we'd like Saturday Night and then as going after that and my dad called out after me and sound like again tonight and thanks for being yourself\n\nI mean maybe not never really under stand in that but\nI'm Still there Ken and um yeah we still don't each other\nThat was on the rise in Minnesota their story highlights how coming out today can be much more complex than what Elon did Twenty one years ago professor ... Patrick Johnson told me it's more complex now for celebrities to\nJanelle Monet a is an example because she didn't come out as gay or it was something much more fluid\nAnd I think we're in a moment of trans news and gender non conforming aid that is really influencing how people announced their sexuality and so it's much more ... than a I'm coming out because I like the same sex it's more like [noise]\nI'm coming out because I like the same sex it's more like well I'm not heterosexual\n[laughter] yeah well ... and like she said that she opened me was I think pan sexual and the shoe guy sometimes in the girl down times and people that are not going for me and I'm also thinking the same vein of someone like Frank Ocean who kind of came out but in actuality never ever used the word gay\nCorrect because it's I think in the moment we're in now it's not about limiting oneself to an identity", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "14"}
