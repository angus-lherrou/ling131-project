[laughter] All right let's talk now about another thing that I Love besides Halloween candy uh movies yes\nWas difficulty romantic comedies yeah um I Want to run you through a few of the films that I watched over this summer a there was one movie in which to overworked assistance set their bosses up each other\nAgain and we need to be miserable people\nThere was another movie I watched this summer where a teenage girl private love letters from mysteriously males to all of her crushes I think it's really cool that you\nThink I have called inspectors in my eyes\nTo let her through then there was this\nOther one where the bride got left at the altar so then she went on our honeymoon with her strange father\nGot credibly drunk at night and I blacked out because [noise]\nThat's what's on the ground and hunting though the funding about all these movies are that these were all rom coms on Netflix you heard clips there from set it up\nTo all the boys I've loved before and like father have you ever watch any of the movies to entry okay which to I watched um Taliban that lived before of course so good and set it up yes let an awful lot\nSo good and set it up yes letter I so love lovely\nFeel retro about him I feel I feel like it stokes a particular part of my heart same same\nSo these movies along with a bunch of other rom com release it on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get some scribe or as to watch from any comedies on the streaming service they even had a name for this big push they called it the summer of love nice uh and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that\nTens of millions of people watch these movies across the world this summer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love so I called up someone who's been covering the summer of a lot of very closely\nHer name is ... when I met she a right for the onions Avi club she'd been closely following the summer of love so we talked all about it\nHey Glenn how are you good how are you doing I'm good thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having me super excited yet I haven't been kind of digging out\nFor several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer and now you didn't even now [noise] um they called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nUh yeah some of them was like a menu of rom com movies that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer a that as it turns out it's not flicks reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million viewers watch and it's not even\nNumber of views that viewers so if you're like me and you watch them like four or five times a piece you you can even multiply that now\nYou watch them like four or five times a piece you you can even multiply that number\nEight eight million people watching his rom coms my big question and first question about all of this was like what led Netflix no or I think\nThat rom coms would work for them you know we've seen the movie studios and like the box office not really take to rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in theaters so knowing that trend line what made Netflix they will just might work for us\nI think they just spied on completely underserved market\nYou know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre\nAnd comic book crossing offshoots\nYeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up\nAt the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want\nLike just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you were kind of out of luck so for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only are churning out these rom coms are also\nTagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that really have been under used\nAnd it's worked out really well for them\nYeah why have the big movie studios at the movies in theaters widely left rom coms writ large I think\nThey're uh they're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and then\nDollars and infinity war but you're going to get more Brazilian dollars back\nChannel with rom coms there was a a golden era you know one Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts you could just basically put Graham with anybody like let's move on to build up next why not ... but then\nYou have something like Reese Witherspoon invincible on and for Christmases and tanked and these are superstars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back\nAnd it's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband into going to see a movie that you know romance themes like it's going to have to be\nA kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free I'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls reruns again it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms honor and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do is been twenty dollars and see a lovely ... end up together river on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with a Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night you got that going out\nTo yeah should we expect movie studios big movie studios are putting movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like does Netflix's summer of love and its success lead to more wrong comes in actual movie theaters um that's an interest\nRom coms in actual movie theaters\nUm that's an interesting question I\nI Do wonder about that because I mean crazies rich Haitians did so well because we just want a you know a lovely\nMovie like that to see you later and and the the story that I wrote another thing that was really prevalent we had a ton of commenters\nAnd because the question is like well why did eighty million people watch this like what is the big question I mean other than like markets or whatever people are just like more depressed were you know we're stressed out we want escapism we want you know we want like just an easy fun movie maybe we don't even want to see things one up anymore I Know that's hard to even like\n[noise] and from the John us and James all night foundation helping NPR advanced journalistic excellence in the digital age\n[noise]\nYou're listening to it's been a minute from NPR I'm Sam Sanders and wanting to our listeners this portion of the show contains descriptions of sexual abuse of minors probably not good for kids\nWe've discussed the me too movement a lot on the show\nMe too and politics me too and how we would be two in journalism and NPR's newsroom even now we're going to talk about me too and sports\nAnd the dozens of stories you've been hearing for months about young elite athletes being abused by their coaches the doctors the mentors people they should be able to trust their reality\nPeople they should be able to trust\nTheir reality and causing a great deal of physical mental and emotional pain he never sailed I mean you take advantage of ... and our dreams you\nThat's on my butt gold medalists alley Raisman she was speaking at the trial of Larry Nassar he was convicted of sexually assaulting numerous young women under his care\nAs a former sports doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State university Nassar was recently sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison in the wake of Nassar's trial top Olympic officials have been forced out most recently Mary Bono resigned as the interim head of USA Gymnastics\nAfter a lot of criticism she held that job and were less than a week today you'll hear from an elite athlete who came forward with her own experience of sexual abuse in another ... former speed skater ... barrel she was sexually abused by another skater when she was just a teenager and\nSo he helps drive my teenager and I to and from practice which both of our family is really appreciated and so anti would almost pick me up every day and we'd frequently go to\nThe rink and skate but you know sometimes we in other places but even if we did go to the rank and skate when there was molest station that happened before and after I mean and the rink parking lots of high school parking lot\nFriday was Fifteen Years old and training to be an Olympic speed skater in New York state when thirty three year olds Olympic medalist Andy Gable entered her life he was a skating God he quickly became brought his mentor and helped her family out\nAs I said he used to drive my friend and I home from practice in the summer and he'd always drop her off first then\nIn the summer and he'd always drop her off first\nThan I mean I can picture clear as day back out of her driveway go down the street stops I take a right and you go to my house and it was like that every time and then one time at that same stops on he took a left and he went to the um a few streets over and there was a dead end\nWhich in hindsight it's\nInteresting that he knew that there was a dead end there was a dead end he pulled the car over took office he found he turned to me and he said can I guess you\nWould have had a minimum I said nothing I just sat there [noise] um I\nWill sit here and honestly say I did not say no and an open door to not run away\nBut I was frozen yeah I mean people say there's fight or flight but there's free and that's what happened and\nI remember after that when we put our seatbelts on and turn the car around I remember just being like a fog or a I mean now now we have an especially I was like W. E. T. F. [laughter] yeah you know and run shocks probably ... percent\nAnd only ... how would I tell anyone who would believe me what proof have\nWhy would anyone believes that he would do you know I mean just um and it wasn't violet\nIn what we think of as traditional violence so he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a windowless fan and you know all that that we pretend to make these people will be so\nYeah that I mean honestly God that is the day my life changed\nWould keep doing this in in ...\nChanged he would keep doing this in in the ... the the contact\nBecome more intense but yeah so so a lot of people say you know like what is what do I mean when I say molested so to\nAnswer that awkward question on any I never had\nSex and the traditional um definition of sex but basically the legal terms is digital penetration um and he would put my hand on himself when he was he wrecked um [noise] and you're touching follow me and I was Fifteen and he was thirty three\nWhile Andy is taking advantage of you do see also like getting close to your family at the same time\nI'm very much so so ah he [noise] he had um a growing issue was skating and so he saw my father for his doctor for that and\nMy mom he came over to the house a couple of times and I took piano lessons from my mom oh my goodness yeah\nSo have you and your house yeah for me I wasn't from your mother you knew what he was doing to she did not know wow so how did that feel\nI don't even know I mean\nI think it it was such a time of\nConfusion and I was so dedicated to wanting to skate\nThat I didn't have any other currency you know I didn't have any\nSee you know I didn't have any anything to barter I didn't have money I didn't have 'em anything the only thing\nThat he wanted for me was my ... slot body um and um it was it so confusing because like I said he wasn't violence with me and he\nTook care of my skates which is very very very time consuming Amir blades they're not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there is something they're not straight they're bent to go left and the offset\nAnd so as especially as a kid like myself gets better and better and better I mean the improvement curve is is pretty steep as a kid and so I'm\nAs you're getting better the all of those metrics have to change and for the night did any at all but trials surgical winner club had a lot of athletes competing I mean we sent more people to the Olympic trials than the national training program sent to the Olympic trials\nSo our coach you also was volunteer had a fulltime job and a family\nUm he and he took care of my blades and I mean our coach\nAndy and other top skaters are higher priority so he helped me out in a lot of ways and my mother said if you want to go to a skating find a ride to the rank\nAnd Andy was my ride [noise]\nDo do you think she ever thought that he was your boyfriend did you think at Fifteen that he was like something approaching a boyfriend\nI definitely did because I didn't know what else that could be yeah um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "city": "Reno", "day": "27"}
