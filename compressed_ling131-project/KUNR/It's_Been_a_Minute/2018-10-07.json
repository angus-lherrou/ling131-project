prince demos that was released late last month the album is called piano and the microphone Nineteen eighty three and it's these nine and released prints demos from way back then\nAnd so the thing

world\nBasis act a you know that no I'm not a big [laughter] yeah\nAnd on Tuesday when Amazon came out with this announcement I talked to Senator Sanders and his line was I got to give credit where credit's due and Amazon and Jeff Bezos made the right call it's a good decision so it's\nYes PR is definitely part of it and another really huge element to all of this is that the economy\nIs presenting an extremely tight labor market there are more job openings than workers and Amazon is heading into this season um holidays are coming up they're going to be fighting for these workers they that they need but also Walmart needs and\nBest Buy needs and all these other retailers need and you know having a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in this this bump in um coverage of that I'm sure it

been a minute from NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was here were to get this week Chris guiding her legal editor at buzzfeed news and Alina Selyukh business correspondent for NPR a I have a question for you both\nBe honest do either of you remember your home coming from high school\nWell I've only been to one because I was an exchange student so I remember it extremely vividly but it was also confusing because I had never known that such an event existed it was\nVery strange uh-huh Chris I think I went [laughter] I was I was in a closeted\nGay boy in Youngstown, Ohio um I went with a girl and I know I went to like home coming in ... but they were not at the notable a life moments that\nThey are for some others I'm bringing up homecoming because it's a subject this week of our long distance call [noise]\nThere's there's you know long distance is a segment where we call up someone somewhere in the world and talk with them about\nSo this week I talked with two students from Austin high school in my home state of Texas are their names are Sicilia McBride and story ... ... I asked them about their home common story or the your average teenagers in the high school band facilities plays ...\nUh the your average teenagers in the high school band Sicilia plays ... stories in the color guard so where are you both now\nOur coach hiding in a corner on your band [laughter]\nSo fun fact I also was in marching band when I was in high school I Am from Texas\nI'm just about an hour south of you guys know where did you go I went to a jets in high school for two years into Clemens high school and shirts for too you know I was a saxophone player I was a drum major so I'm having fond\nFond font thoughts of my days hiding in the corner while we\nActually played jets and at a competition on Saturday\nReally small world small world yeah [laughter] the Syrian story there are a couple and their friends nominated them to be on the homecoming court\nHe just wants I just want the opportunity to win together or we didn't have to work together but I mean we didn't even have the chance at least originally we did it\nTo do you want it to run on the homecoming court as a keen but at the school administration told her that only boys can be genes and only girls can be queens\nTo go to and stories said that this made it impossible for a gay couple to actually win together they push back in the school actually changed the rules that same day they decided to have no gender titles in the homecoming contest no ... no queens everyone on homecoming court\nWould just be known as quote royals but that didn't make facilities in story happy\nI mean it's definitely a step forward it another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples story how do you feel about this\nThey think they were over compensating rather than just reading and that well it shouldn't have been at a gym there they should have just made it so you were\nJust your ... and that well it shouldn't have been ... jump there they should have just made it so you are voting for equal regardless of gender ... whether or not they were now since the king\nOr queen or anything between and it was up to that it wasn't up to that school and we're going to take out come on circuit takeout ... is one couple wants to run together\nA spokesperson for the school told us quote we can say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one often independent school district is committed to creating a safe supportive environment for all students and staff including those who identify as algae be teach you plus since the change the sodium story had been dealing with the fallout\nOther students support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much the same way as we are when they say that they don't think that this court did what they should have done they don't like the new policy it isn't what home coming is supposed to\nBe about um outside of Austin order hearing about it a common ... they're not very positive\nWhat's been the worst kind of comments\nThat are mostly basically saying that we're that we're that we're ... we're asking for special treatment and that this is exactly what they would have expected to electing a same sex couple is not a real and how come after the house\nPeople really think there's going to ruin homecoming\nMobile ended up taking away the whole homecoming tradition\nGotcha is they're going to be other stuff that you all go through throughout this year are you a senior year right yeah that will have to I mean like there's probably going to be\nOther gender roles for other senior year traditions as well my kids are gonna be a situation when it comes to prom king and queen what happens next Hi\nYes actually that's one of the teachers that has\nIn what happens next uh\nYes actually that's one of the teachers that have been talking about the whole issue that you write off and land jumps you like and I can't wait until we get the prom I\nUsed to be running for prom king and queen ... actually turned out\nMy goodness so there may be more drama I had before the years done [laughter] please [noise]\nSo these two young women says soda and stories they've been dealing with this fall out some students support than others don't like the outcome the votes actually aren't done yet that's going to happen next week but this story really made\nMe think like Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for Texas but for the country\nAnd so you have the school administration that is trying to in some way be an ally to these young women but even they can't figure out what the right language is what the right term should be I think\nWe're in this period where defining and letting gender roles be more fluid can be confusing for some people\nI I just celebrated my forte first birthday and one of the things that I've learned is like that means that I'm getting older and\nI'm not going to necessarily understand how a younger group of people is looking at things and I mean we could have been having the same conversation Twenty years ago and somebody saying like\nThey're trying to be supportive why aren't they okay with just being known as friends why why why do we need to talk about the fact that they're a gay couple and\nTo talk about the fact that they're a gay couple and that they're together like that's like talking about their sex lives there\nNPR's Alina Selyukh a business correspondent for NPR

I think my brother has kind of position he was a little more of a Bernie Sanders guy and\nI think his position was you know will burn it could have won this [noise] and you know my mom lives in in South central Ohio and she was saying well they forgot about the mid west they gave up the mid west which is ridiculous and I was kind of like well it's ... fault and this\nAnd it just struck me that if we're also aligned and ... and we're fighting what's going on to their tables around the country and and so I I knew that that arena would be like a really fun area for us to explore and I knew it can be funny and potentially explosive yeah\nWhat I Love about the movie and you miss 'em that it it it it makes us all think about how and when and how much we should talk about politics\nI covered the last election in my ... M O throughout was like people to talk about it more because of this stuff shapes the nation and we put the hard stuff to the side are only preach to the choir here to talk about more but now\nI'm usually like everyone just shut a thing I was like\nI was the guy for a good year and a half that sit down at dinner with some friends first day on TALK about can you believe that this is insane and I did that thing where I was like I don't understand how people are not talking about is that what is bigger what's a bigger news story and you're in my lifetime\nTalking about is that what is bigger what's the bigger news story in your in my lifetime that what's happening now there's not one minute so I I was getting frustrated that people's frustration with me talking about it and what I I recently\nI recently started trying to find that balance a little bit and like if you are just if you are just on Twitter all day and you're just you're just raise your blood pressure raises your blood pressure and I think you know when I wrote the movie I was like I Want to put myself in the head of Chris my character who really has obsessive and in these consumed by the cycle\nSo I had to CNN Fox News or MSNBC on twenty four really and I was reading it and it makes you crazy too [laughter]\nIt is a a slightly romantic story but I'm ... right after we first meet them um I really wanted to show the wear and tear that that she was going through with him um because that was very\nVery much based off of my wife I really yeah so well\nMy wife who is it is you know politically active and she goes to the marches and has very little ... to NPR I'm Steve Inskeep her litter she does not in the area [laughter] I'm a I'm there was one morning where it was like six twenty five in the morning and\nI uh she was in bed next to me and she was breastfeeding her her newborn and I was reading some articles that was you know like it's not helping not help out of your job and I turned her yeah that was happening presidents and I turned to her I said just like you know morose Leah America's lost\nHis a dude six twenty five AM I'm breastfeeding that I have an animal ... let me alone this is the most basic uh you\nLet me alone this is the most base a use of nature here\nOr a but but um yeah I ...
