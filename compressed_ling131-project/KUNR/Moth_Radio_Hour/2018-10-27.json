In all the years uh of living under my parents' roof I never broke a bone um my mother and father never one time had to take me to the emergency room and I strongly suspect that um we never had to\nUh buy a second box of band aids and the reason for that was pretty simple my parents were spectacularly protective\nAh and and Harvard over me to make sure that no pain or physical injury should occur\nI Lived in a state of New Hampshire but never set my feet into ski boats um I don't think a piece of athletic equipment ever crossed our threshold my\nMother made sure that I didn't enter the

as an artist to be a parent [noise]\nUm and in the morning we never talked about it holidays were particularly stressful time in our family I'm with a particular amount of alcohol more than one Christmas my father ah through the tree across the floor\nUm my mother was gone surprisingly often and when she was it was left to me to hide the car keys\n[noise] and maybe because of that although I grew up to have the um the life of a certain level of artistic expression that heavy looted my two I'm enormously artistically gifted parents the goal that I found most elusive and wonderful was to be part of a happy family\nAnd I believe that my best shot of having happy\nRelatives was to give birth to them [noise]\nSo I married quite young at twenty three an artist I'm and though I Would come to realize over the years that we had surprisingly little in common um we did both share a passion uh creative passion although he was a painter and died was a writer I think we both\nMean you'll be

his artist father\nThe words love is the best art of all [noise] and I think that was the moment that I knew\nFoolishness of ever supposing that I could protect my children from pain and the folly of the ways that I had attempted to do so [noise]\nThat was sixteen years ago since then um\nMany injuries have been incurred my children for many years traveled back and forth between our two houses

boyfriends breaking up with them and a case of malaria on a trip to Africa because they continue to be adventurers they just went farther and farther away [noise]\nThe thing is that I have discovered that although I failed abysmally at protecting my children from pain I Am in fact related by blood to three amazingly happy and well adjusted human beings\nUm and what I Believe now is that as impossible as it is to spare our children pain\nThe real task before a parent [noise] is to raise them so that they will be strong enough to survive it things [noise]\nThat was\nAlways there for

her writing I used to think of\nMy writing is just kind of my you know my way of getting in the back door and what I really wanted to be which was up on a stage connecting with an audience um and actually although I Love what I Do and I feel really\nExtraordinarily lucky to have gotten to do to do this all the years that I have um my one complaint\nAbout being a a writer for the page is that I don't get to see and hear the response of a reader to my work um\nAnd here the response of a reader to my work um so at the mosque they did and I could hear people laugh\nAnd I could hear people gasp sometimes [noise] um I also learned a lot I could feel when I can feel when you're losing somebody you can feel when you need to pull him back um\nIt it's it's a very immediate form of storytelling that actually has informed my writing for the page as well and not just my my memoir writing but but absolutely my fiction\nWe talked about how rarely writers get to experience firsthand the reactions of their audience back\nA million years ago when I was a reporter in New York City I remember one time riding the subway to Times Square and seeing somebody open up the New York times with a story that I had written and I was looking over her shoulder and I was so excited to watch her reading\nThat's so cool guy and I'm sure the person reading it would have died and she knew she was the next to the author\nI don't know I think there are probably greater thrilled in her life but but for\nMe um to be able to hear laughter that most of all to hear laughter\nPart of what makes you are writing so brilliant is your willingness to be vulnerable and like very open on the page did you feel even more vulnerable will be on stage with direct experience with the audience\nThe more willing you are to to expose your flaws and failings I Would just say you're humanness the the more you will the more I Will relate to an audience world audience will relate to me\nSo I wanted to ask for listeners who I Want to do which is is how ... how are your children doing give us an update it well\nThis is how ... how are your children doing give us an update well ... it's pretty easy to locate\nThem I'm One of

station\nAnd which meant that she literally drove our station wagon and welcomes our new neighbors I'm In Fort Knox Kentucky and sometimes she took my brothers and I with her and\nAt the end of a very long day and my father would come home he would put his brief case down and then he would have wished my mother a on a a a tango down the hallway they went to all the way down and then they would turn they would go all the way back up as the three of us watched it was awesome\nAnd then we would we would have dinner together and then invariably we would go to the den and we would watch television we loved TV we watch Sanford and son and Chico when the man\nYeah she had a good times co jak\nDemand from Atlanta is we love TV my mom was really kind of crazy and fun she liked to make up dances um my

the cake [laughter] drama queen was born [noise]\nSo my mom was just really just a very funny person one time on a road trip and uh we always drove in my father's Cadillac and we had our designated seats my father drove my mother was in the passenger seat my older brother to my left me in the middle 'cause I was the middle child and my baby brother to the right\nAnd one time on this road trip my mother or a white lady\nCut us off in her car and my mother said Iraq [noise]\nAnd my father said to her is [laughter] 'cause you know the kids are in the back of the car come on doors and so my mom

Christmas morning we woke up we opened our presence I'm I received a bedspread did that happen\nI received a bedspread that had the map of the United states on it and it had the capital of each state marked I loved his best friend but I I think it was probably the last time that I cared about geography [noise]\nSo after we ate breakfast we got into the car all in our designated seats my father and the driver's seat my mom and the passenger seat my older brother to my left my younger brother to my rights and we drove from Fort Knox Kentucky to Greensboro North Carolina to visit my father's parents my grandparents\nThat one point on the trip my mother said that she wanted to take a nap so she took off her seat belt and she sort of nestled herself and her seat\nAnd I said I wanted to take a nap to so I turned around um and I straddle the hump in the back of the Cadillac and I put my head down on the seat and went to sleep\nThe next thing that I remember is a there was a screech and scream and a crash and we'd been in a really terrible terrible car accident so remember\nI was six years old and my only contacts for car accidents was television so when I remember is if we had a musical soundtrack the music was gone and what was replaced was\nA heavy breathing and it was in slow motion and as I lifted my head and I look to my left I was facing the back I looked at my little brother who's trying to catch his breath which is probably the heavy breathing I heard and I looked in front of me in the car had been split in half we're kind of we hit an embarrassment\nSomebody hit us um and then I looked at my older brother\nSomeone that hit us um and then I looked at my older brother and he had blood on his forehead\nAnd as I kept turning around and I looked into the front seat of the car I saw my father still in his seat belt unconscious lying on the seat and then the dashboard the center of the car was also split in half and\nTo the right of the dash split and the dash there was\nBlood and teeth and above that\nA crack in the windshield and a little bit of blood there as well and I kept turning to the right and my mother was unconscious still lying where she was when she was you know taking a nap\nSo\nAt this moment", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "27"}
