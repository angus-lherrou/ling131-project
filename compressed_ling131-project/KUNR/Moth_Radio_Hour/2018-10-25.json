lucky lady he told the story and a mosque night called sense and sensibility stories about currency\n\n\nBe ready tidy okay [noise]\nTwo months ago I was in a casino in southern Washington state's feeling ill\nAre driven down from Seattle where I live now\nA friend of mine was was visiting Portland, Oregon and uh so I've driven down to to see him um but I also brought along ten thousand dollars in cash with me because you never know\nAnd a daughter who is because you know on the way a gamble a little bit and then went to Portland hung out with him and spent the night and I was back in the casino and I was hung over and ill in part because I was in a casino\nAnd uh casinos are a little bit sad\nAnd small casinos in impoverished rural areas are a little bit extra set [noise]\nAre a little bit extra set [noise]\nAnd I was also concerned about my own gambling and my relationship to what I was doing at that moment I used to play a blackjack for a living I was a card counter um which is card counting as a a legitimate um\nMathematically valid method for winning at the casino game blackjack and I I used to do that for a living and then uh and then my life took an unexpected\nCourse since I Am sitting at this table thinking about these things and suddenly the man next to me has dealt a hand he gets a twenty as his hand a but it's not an ordinary twenty it's made up of to queens apart screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts and as soon as I saw that hand hit the table I thought maybe\nUm everything's going to be All right\nNow I used to kind of cards for a living and I was taught to do that by a group of friends mentors or who were some extraordinary people very brilliant very poised prosperous and sort of beautiful in a way and they are incorporated me into a blackjack team that they had been operating for some time and taught me how to go into casinos and when my\nAnd my job was to go in and when a and take the money out of the casino which you take in cash you take it a new stuff it into your pockets you stuff it into money belts you put it into your breast pocket of your shirt or a jacket and you walk out with it and you feel physically enhanced with that happens\nIt's almost like a part of your body and you bring it back to your teammates we share our winnings and so you distribute five thousand dollars bad here ten thousand dollars trapped there and everybody gathers around ecstatic and it's almost like they're feeding off your own flesh and [noise] after earning my living that way for several years I sold a book about the experience of ...\nEventually someone but grudgingly they paid\nI took away I took every hundred dollar bills that they had\nI took away I took every hundred dollar bills that they had in the casinos are small place I also took every fifty dollar bill [laughter]\nAnd a lot of the twenties [noise]\nAnd I took this one and just stuffed it down my pants that I was physically ... expanded\nIn this weird for cheaper and way sort of like in the old days but I turned around and I wasn't in Las Vegas I was in this ... this small place where there were twenty five or thirty people all staring at me customers or the casino\nPeople who work there weren't going around and everybody there knew exactly\nWhat I had just one and it seemed me at the cashier they knew I was getting paid in cash and so I moved briskly for the ... and a briskly across the parking lot and I started the engine of my car drove out made a series of strategic you try to ensure I wasn't being followed\nAnd then got on the interstate five north towards Seattle through the woods in the dark of night it was five PM but at the Pacific northwest so\nExpanded in this way as I said but also I felt this team in the sense of\nParanoia averaging on terror and I kept looking back in the rearview mirror examining\nThe headlights and the distance trying to into it if any of the cars back to their look menacing and I kept asking myself again and again is\nEverything going to be All right\nThank you\nThat would happen\n[noise] that jackass [noise] Josh ... until rich\nA rock is unfairly dark memoir of his life as a professional card counting blackjack player Catherine Burns them off the artistic director sat down to talk to Josh about his history with them off here's Katharine remembering the first time she heard him tell a story at a party\nIt was totally silent with everybody turn to you holding their attention telling this unbelievably riveting story and thinking that at this party is actually what we want them off to be\nAnd he has to come do this at the players club you know in front of two hundred and fifty people instead of twenty five and then lessen the bless your heart you did agree to do that and did it and were brilliant\nWell I think part of part of the whatever might happen with with card counting story specifically in a room has a lot to do with the nature of the stories themselves because people when they're hearing them are I think struck with the possibility that they just can't decide if the person is in fact\nA lunatic thinks that he goes around winning casinos and has paranoid delusions of being chased by casino personnel or in fact a deft um you know genuine professional\nSo you so you had been telling stories like this to groups of friends at dinner parties for years and years clearly but what was it like the first time you actually stepped on stage with the purpose of telling a story to a crowd of strangers\nIt was harrowing it's like a dozen body of experience you're there in the spotlight is on you you're not really aware of your limbs or the rest of your your body in the normal way that you would be when Josh\nIt was or the rest of your your body and the normal way that you would be\nWhen Josh ... resigned no plane left at casinos he was appearing on them off stage ongoing seemed name Lee Aaron Blair\nOr did it a under a pseudonym\nI'm In part because my name at that time still has some value\nTo sort of value of a card counters real name tends to deteriorate overtime as soon as he has become increasingly aware of it\nUm but also because it's long been obvious to me the card counter if you'd legally changes his name should change it to three or more first name's presents a piece of ID chew a person that casino he can claim that any one of the names is actually the first name\nAnd you know depending on how familiar the casino personality is with that particular form of id they're often you know they see ideas from all over the country there are often confused I'm so that you can create from one legal name multiple aliases based on a genuine id [noise]\n'cause you're the master this interview ...

her sister lived in Domenico where she was born and where she grew up they call road uh\nBy letters they wrote to each other a letters that they would see up in an envelope and post a and the letters would be taken on a boat that would\nMake weekly stops on the island of the ... the islands I think you would in Wynwood island\nUm and uh the letters\nA word that they send to each other was written in English\nWas written in English proper English but the language they spoke the spoken language was French ... ah the letters um\n[noise] uh I never knew what the corps was about because when they we received a letter in English they received each other's letters in English\nThey then would respond to the letters verbally in French ... so I couldn't understand French ... and I was never shown the letters but only I knew\nA certainly from my mother's side the reaction of the letters um this was incredibly ah interesting to me ah everything my mother did was interesting to me I I'm adored her but mostly what I adored about her that she adored me [noise]\nUh [noise] so I liked to see her angry or it was interesting to me to see her angry and speaking in this language which I had no interest in learning at all [noise]\nUm because in any case it wasn't a proper language was just a broken language also lead or toad\n[noise] um [noise]\nEven truly a well as I say I was very I adored this person a eventually when I was around nine years of age I should say I'm a my mother became\nMy mother became pregnant I don't know how this happened [noise] um\nShe I did have a stepfather her husband but still the pregnancy a\nSebastian had been a war reporter for more than Twenty years but this is the first time on stage with them all my stories or person off in fact stories told on them off age are most times the most important most defining stories from my personal life\nHere Sebastian on crafting this story\nYou know I Do a lot of public speaking and I'm used to sort of talking and explaining how things work\nAnd then I started to understand that that's not what the law says\nYou're really doing is telling a story\nTo understand something more deeply [noise]\nThe story that you're about to hear includes images of war and it's not suitable for children I\nWas told at a mosque night called I witnessed stories from the frontlines here [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy\nOne I grew up in a wealthy suburb\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man and I thought war would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pens and a few thousand\nDollars I went to Bosnia during the civil war is are able to try to learn to be a war reporter and war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not disappoint but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body it wasn't a fighter most of the people\nDying words of civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war\nIt was a girl who's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been\nI'm taken by served paramilitary forces are and\nThey took her up to a field above a town called ... and they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat and when I saw her it was a couple of weeks later of summer it was hot and it's the only way you could tell she was a girl or\nAnd it's the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm\nI remember the first time I got ready to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines that it was\nA going getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really weren't good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us but their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was ... and I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt at all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little\nBlack hole the bullet comes out of you know one pointed guy\n... his gun and started to shoot another guy grab the barrel inject it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was attorney inside those holes and there are so small the thickness of a pencil and attorneys in there and I\nCouldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze in combat\nYou go to war you think you think you're going to be brave\nHave you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost\nRestrepo twenty minutes positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against them sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you\nSo much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters the first thing that happens is you you ask yourself am I getting shot at because the sounds of bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle\nAnd then the gunfire arrives a moment later\nAnd then the gunfire arrives moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then as everything goes crazy well the boy\nThe boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt\nWhat's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right now what's the\nMath on that angle you don't even want to think about it um\nAnd then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nBullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking and did everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags and our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bulletproof vest\nWe're getting attacked from three sides they're coming up under the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there\nHe finally jumps across that gap any grab stuff he throws my camera to me it throws my bullet proof vest grabs this stuff is throwing amateur soldiers to the soldiers are pinned down to and it gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I started shooting I start working and then I'm fine\nI'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously\nVery very brave a lot braver than me um\nHe was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know [noise]\nThoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nAre free to love each other on reserve easily without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were going to call every struggle and we were going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot on this ridge in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Phillies on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of ... So Tim took the next trip\n\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seeing a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American positions got overrun they dragged off a wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that same broke his leg he's a ten thousand feet up on the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long\nAnd the medic examines his foot and says well is broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by Don and we're going to get hammered\nHere's two Advil\nAnd Tim new Tim knew that if\nPrepared to walk all night on a broken leg for it\nIf you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out there and he did it I don't know how but he did it he got down off that mountain so we finished up our deployment\nAnd um that's how we started to think of it are deployment [noise] um and er nothing you know the rest of it was okay the worst was in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\n\nIf the the film did really well and started it started with this scene um that was very took me a long time to be able to watch it actually I Would always close my eyes when it came\nUm what's the scene where I'm riding in a Humvee 'cause I took the next trip after Tim broke his leg\nOr running in a Humvee and all of a sudden everything goes orange and black and the Humvee got blown up", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "25"}
