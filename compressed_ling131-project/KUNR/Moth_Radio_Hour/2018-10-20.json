and spent the night and I was back in the casino and I was hung over and ill in part because I was in a casino\nAnd uh casinos are a little bit sad\nAnd small casinos in impoverished rural areas are a little bit extra set [noise]\nAnd I was also concerned about my own gambling and my relationship\nAnd I was concerned about my own gambling and my relationship to what I was doing at that moment I used to play blackjack for a living I was a card counter um which is card counting as a a legitimate um\nMathematically valid method for winning the casino game blackjack and I I used to do that for a living and then uh and then my life took an unexpected\nCourse since I Am sitting at this table thinking about these things and suddenly the man next to me has dealt a hand he gets a twenty as his hand a but it's not an ordinary twenty it's made up of to queens of ... screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts and as soon as I saw that hand hit the table I thought maybe\nUm everything's

and sort of beautiful in a way and they are incorporated me into a blackjack team that they had been operating for some time and taught me how to go into casinos and when my\nAnd my job was to go in

but also because it's long been obvious to me that a card counter reviewed legally changes his name should change it to three or more first name's presents a piece of ID chew a person in a casino he can claim that any one of the names is actually the first name\nAnd you know depending on how familiar the casino personalities with that particular form of id they're often you know they see ideas

[noise]\nThe story that you're about to hear includes images of war and it's not suitable for children\nIt was told amongst night called I Witness stories from the front line here in the ... [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one\nFirst went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy suburb\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables and I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man and I thought war would be exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pens and a few thousand dollars I went to Bosnia\nDuring the civil war Sarajevo to try to learn to be a war reporter\nAnd war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not disappoint but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body it wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people dying words the civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war\nIt was a girl who's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken by served paramilitary forces are and ... they took her up to a field above a town called ...\nAnd they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat\nAnd when I saw her it was a couple of weeks later was summer it was hot\nThe only way you could tell\nHot and the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm\nI remember the first time I got ready to ... to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines that it was\nA ... getting pretty bad out there and I tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really weren't good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us but their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was ... and I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see\nThe little black hole the bullet comes out of you know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot another guy grab the barrel and jerked it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us\nMinutes well all these little black holes are staring at us I thought what does it turn it inside those holes and there are so small the thickness of a pencil and attorneys\nIn there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look at them for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something something\nI needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet\nAnd I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze\nIn combat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave\nHave you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost\nCalled Restrepo Tony man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against them sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd when you have to understand about bull is is that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you\nSo much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters the first thing that happens is you you ask yourself am I getting shot at because the sound the bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives moment later\nSubtle and then the gunfire arrives moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then as everything goes crazy well the boy\nThe boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face it that's what I felt what's\nThe angle of deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right you know what's the math on\nThat angle you don't even want to think about it um\nAnd then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nBullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking and did everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras\nBulletproof as\nWe're getting attacked from three sides they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there\nHe finally jumps across that gap any grab stuff he throws my camera to me it throws my bullet proof vest that grabs his stuff is throwing a motor soldiers does the soldiers are pinned down too and he gets back and I have my camera in my hand\nAnd I started shooting I start working and then I'm fine\nI'm not scared any more Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously very\nVery brave a lot braver than me um\nHe was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war\nAbout war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nAre free to love each other on reserve Italy\nWithout it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary about this little outpost we were going to call every struggle and we're going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot\nOn this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my killings on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of hail up So Tim took the next trip\n\nHe was on a on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation\nUp up in the mountains on foot very bad seeing a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got\nKilled and wounded at one point um the American physicians got overrun they drag off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that same broke his leg is it ten thousand feet up on the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long\nAnd the medic examines his foot and says well as broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by Don and we're going to get hammered\nHere's two Advil\nAnd Tim new Tim knew that\nYou're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty ...\nIf you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it I don't know how but he did it he got down on that mountain so we finished up our deployment\nAnd um that's how we started to think of it are deployment I'm and I'm not you know the rest of it was okay the worst was in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\n\nAnd if the the film did really well and started it started with this scene um that was very took me a long time to be able to watch it actually I Would always close my eyes when it came um the scene where I'm riding in a Humvee\n'cause I took the next trip after Tim broke his leg\nOr riding in a Humvee and all of a sudden everything goes orange and black and the Humvee got blown up", "year": "2018", "show_name":
