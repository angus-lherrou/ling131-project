from buffalo Missouri and he moved there because his dad was a preacher and he was going to take over the local church\nAnd Brennan was great he would later become the captain of all the sports teams at high school and he loved the town he said Omar you're going to love each year everyone is so nice and friendly like for example I just got my hair cut at this guy named\nTroy and Troy is the best okay he talked to me about sports about church you got to go see him so then that day when my dad pick me up I was like dad let's go to Troy is for haircuts so we went to Troy and Troy is\nIs a mobile home\nWith like a barber chair in there and so we walk in and there's a Confederate flag hanging up\nAnd my dad like ... if you'd better leave and I was like no down we're going to stay Troy is the best [noise]\nAnd he was like\nTraumas like\nWe're not taking any new clientele\nAnd you better get home before it gets dark\nAnd I was like this business model is flawed\nAnd my dad like were gone and we got back in the car and on the way home my dad didn't say anything\nAbout it and didn't need to he still hasn't said anything about it to this day because\nHe must have realized that he had taken us to a place where we didn't even feel safe getting her hair cut and it must have been especially taxing for him because there's a strong\nIn today's hour of radiolab up next the wonder how do

public\nBroadcasting the theme was big night at the orphans theater and our next story teller shared a story about her big night here's Kerry Adam live in South Dakota [noise]\nSo when I got married I was a DUI why crafty crazy person\nFrom the minute I got engaged I became obsessed with the details of the wedding\nI thought it was an opportunity to show everybody who we were as a couple and not that we were just perfect for each other but that we had perfect case to side dived into research I was looking up at cakes and photo booth backdrops and wedding dresses I was basically the reason interest with invented [laughter]\nAnd after all my deep dives I was ready to go I started the invitation I hand embroidered every one of my wedding invitation [noise]\nOne of my wedding invitation [noise]\nAnd I mailed them in on the left with vintage stamp size picked out to match the personalities of every person that I invited [noise] so my dad got a salute to the military stamp and I just got our ... for a vintage WC Fields for a funny friend ...\nI may have some Still Alice is leftover if you're a fan of Presley but after those were sent off I started thinking about the reception [noise]\nI don't like the smell of flowers that give me a headache if I decided to make all of our center pieces I Would create flowers from buttons from his family and my family I made my weddings okay like I created flowers from pieces of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom's wedding veil\nAnd he went along with all of this [laughter] she actually went with me to thrift stores picking out all the ... vintage plates we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little ... for the twelve cake so you're going to have\nIs twelve I'm a big believer in cake so [noise]\nThere were things he cared about to mostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle he composed it an orchestrated it and send it off to the bands and we got prepared for our big day it's going to be so beautiful like an anthropology catalog threw up over everything but [noise]\nWe got married on April twenty fourth which isn't my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years in the day of my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring us\nThe day of my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring us the same good luck and we were married outside St Louis Missouri in a town called ... core which is his home town and his sister's back yard\nSo on April twenty fourth we hung olive twinkling lights and the trees decorative little stars put out tables in my beautiful center pieces and on every seat lay down a custom made played bill I had done for the event\nNow all of this preparation he failed to mention that April in Missouri is tornado season [noise] I was actually watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins and to the shapes of swans when the tornado siren went off\nAnd then came the rain and then the hail\nAnd wins and it knocked all of the tables over and all of my beautiful center pieces into the mud six months of making them every night\nAnd they were destroyed no one saw any of it\nLuckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter]\nThe only time that lucky by the way\nWe had invited all of these ... people but we hadn't trapeze artist and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do this pitch a tent so\nUp with the big top and we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made got my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trapped in I'm are ready to begin\nTo begin\nRabbit was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't get into little cart I made so we just proceed without her\n[noise] um [noise]\nI was looking forward to the song\nHadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play it because the bandleader had a heart attack [noise] he's fine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing it without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nFavorite show so um [noise]\nThe photographer had never shot a wedding before so she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some guy showed up and apparently brought a stomach virus that I had not registered for um [noise] so throughout the day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies\nAmongst all of this the worst part for me was that my dad decided not to come\nUh I didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle\nAnd so he said I'm not going to be there and\nI have a stepfather that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself\nBut he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called them I called him and he said well I send a check\nAs if that's the same thing on his only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding and that will always be true\nAnd that will always be true but I Can't do a father and daughter dance by myself\nSo I I danced with his dad my grandfather and as we weighed beneath the big top he looked at me and said your dad should have been here and he should've been [noise] and then\nMaybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise] all of our hamburger spiders just went up in flames [laughter]\nBut\nHe also missed the double rainbow that came out after the storm is finally passed by and he missed our friends singing a song from ... to do and and also has to pay and jump around [noise]\nAnd so after all it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle police math and the specialty cocktail I have made which is just jak and coke but\n[noise] in fact it was our friends\nAnd family that showed up for us\nAfter all the details don't make a day\nAnd they don't make the marriage either because I'm not married anymore and I don't think a perfectly sunny day and matching escort cards would have changed that we shouldn't have gotten married there's some things even take can't fix [noise]\nMaybe if I hadn't been so caught up in all of the preparations I Would have realized that but there are\n... I Would have realized that but there are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happens after the big day is over\nBut\nEven though it began with the storm it didn't end with one we were married increase corps which literally translates to broken heart and my dad says now [noise] [noise] well it looks like I didn't miss anything anyway\nBut he did he missed a part of my life\nAnd he also missed our friend I'm a meat loaf cover artist called pot roast um\nIt was also are videographer\nSinging karaoke in the garage well all of our friends danced in the pedals\nSo we missed a lot you would think that with all this I Would sort of be sick of weddings I mean there are people who think they are a scam but I Love weddings I Love the details and stuff and I became a wedding planner\n[laughter] I've\nMarried about twenty five couples and there'd been no tornado that any of them we've all been beautiful had perfectly detailed days I've added more and more pins probably about six thousand now all of these ideas going through my head\nAnd so if I ever get married again I'm totally going to a low [noise]\n\nCarry at him [noise] in addition to being a wedding planner Kerry also\nRuns an online store called the plumb fields shop her dream\nAn online store called the plumb fields shopping\nHer dream to be a magicians assistant I'm just putting that out there for you carry all it takes is one big breaking to see some pictures from Kerry wedding all the and the details visit them off dot org I keep meaning to ask\nCarrie if she includes karaoke led by pot roast as part of her standard wedding package that would be a big seller I think\nMm Mm\nMm\nDemands radio hours produce more limited in public media in Woods Hole Massachusetts and presented by the public radio exchange pure X. dot org [noise]\nThis is the month on you in our public radio\nNext week at radiolab from two to three o'clock in the Planet Money and how I built this from three to four today on how I built this we'll meet a guy\nWho stopped at nothing to keep its yogurt company in business you did what any self for acting entrepreneur does he called his mom and borrowed thirty thousand dollars from her and on the Planet Money will look for\nFrom her and on the Planet Money will look for small tweaks to annoying problems it's an hour of economics and innovation on Planet Money and how I built it from NPR on K U when our public radio [noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to them off radio hour from PR acts I'm Jennifer ... next up our final story it's another from our show in Albuquerque with our partners K. A. N. W. here's Tristan reef lives in Mexico\nTo bright spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trail with my partner but if he's just ahead of me on the path and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now have this\nJune to have a baby silence\nTurns around and I see that he is laughing at me this is the stupidest idea you've ever had\nNo I don't want to have a baby in his defense or we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while\nI'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of helium Riley had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just trying to get that teased\nSeven and we were just trying to get that teased a freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby and\nI was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth to a baby or this isn't some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender\nUh for me that means that I was born female uh I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling a feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realize that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nA and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem um and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant that um I could stay alive a and I could transition and that could be happy\nUm which is what I did um [noise]\n\nUh I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\nIt turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a choice\nI didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and Ben is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nBut you know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby\nA and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to have the beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am I'm but\nI uh live in a world of rainbows and unicorns ah and I just hope that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer I'm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started that thing maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\n[noise]\nI had read all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I refused I think the pregnancy test and then they made me and I took it\nAnd there were two lines and I was pregnant and it was going to be a baby you know but also super scared because\nBut also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for a baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of a baby [noise]\nI'm Haley unwind we'd been toddlers when they came to live with that so I didn't know what to do with a baby and then my body started to change really quickly I'm an all of those ah markers of femininity everything just got bigger everywhere\nAnd I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on to my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like ... my dad than I can spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do or\nI could get excited about the thing that it can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just let everything else go\nA and wait around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly\nUm and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out as trans um because our lives our misery says the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes there's hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and transition\nNot like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color but for all of us there's also joy and love and and resilience in family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready um\nAnd we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nI don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone's don't read that um CNN a Washington\nPost people magazine pregnant man and I thought that maybe just as good you know maybe people are ready for this\nNext evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know I'm\nIn the trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there is a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trans um a lady once told me that she adopted her niece too and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve well also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready\nPortland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um\nI became really good friends with the ... and ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I'm just a really ugly\nHarry woman and that I was going to give birth to a monster and then one woman sent me a message that said as a Christian I Hope that you give birth to a dead baby\nBecause that baby will be better off than a baby that has to be born to someone like you I was six months pregnant when I read that message\nNow I have been trans for a long time Fifteen Years I'm actually at age thirty five I'm I Am past the point of average life expectancy for a trans person in America today [noise] um I think that I'm resilient and and strong and and powerful", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour",
