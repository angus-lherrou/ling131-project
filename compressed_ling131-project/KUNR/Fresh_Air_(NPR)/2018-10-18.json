dealmaker and self made billionaire\nBut recent New York times reporting reveals a different narrative it's based on a trove of more than a hundred thousand pages of documents including confidential tax returns and financial records given to the times by a secret source\nThe documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars from his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump millionaire by the time Donald was eight\nOver the years Donald received today's equivalent of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of his money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which according to my guess or

congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome the fresh air attack a pleasure to have you here get a sense of Frank Trump Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak for\nTrump was a remarkable builder and in New York's the strategy was the guy who had built and sold his first home before he reached the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid

middle class housing um whose homes which he built in his apartment buildings which he built and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens or committee is no frills homes that he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the\nThe Henry Ford of um of building in Brooklyn and queens and his uh and so we had enormous skill building middle class housing and she also specialized\nBuilding middle class housing and she also specialize in\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies that began to build in the thirties and forties

this story really dissect that narrative and I think more than anything else offers\nReaders now based on the actual facts um in based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty for president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on a President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more

of the three writers who reported just\nA couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how is the self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father funneled to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about\nUm ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlayed that into his into his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] uh we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans low one million I'm In today's dollars of course it's two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million votes\nOn top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw transferred to Don and what we what we also saw but I think what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never repay aid you know he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you'd run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nHe used the money for many of his ventures the how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars um in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in ...\nNot only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to get his father these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from its own investments\nIt also see that when his so you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety was there to catch them there's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and\nYou see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nIn the you know the back end of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money steering million dollars' worth if it was three and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and do well and it was caught a soldier the wheel is taken to Fred Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk and ...\nEmpire and potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor front Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move it's incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\nSo what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... live\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this is an attempt to put his um to Jane complete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe the the empire that Fred Trump doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nI guess or New York times reporters

but have Fred Trump use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nSo then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off\nTrump die Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision so the interesting thing about\nThat sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that for a Trump very much wanted this empire\nTo stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meetings after fraud Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months\nUm to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSounds so that the the buildings that were selling all of those buildings ... own at this time of his death out their dos include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included both of buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it's sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer and ... and the price tag was just over\nNew York development ... and the price tag was just over seven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the ... the documents that we went through that that sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't\nSo if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the I. R. S.\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with that so it's true that the virus actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they're placed on buildings made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning if him for a million more bucks on that return\nBut the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families who are the most expensive legal and accounting helping\nThe most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage in these very sophisticated maneuvers to to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or\nThey're looking though at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just in a state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the art of the comeback or The Apprentice\nAnd tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or the comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nOh well so he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse\nAnd through his grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book so happens to coincide with the time when the actually\nAnd to coincide with the time when you're actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate\nTax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the bat it actually cause it's perfectly with the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice in the song money money money money\nThat happened in two thousand and four I'm right is the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that fried Trump built and paid for [noise] I'm Wondering\nHow you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making\nAbilities\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting\nIn that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nPete it over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've ... that I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's hard for a few because it's absolutely true in the documents are there in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access and who were locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it who is allowed to go you know [laughter] we\nUh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter] [laughter] but we uh yeah it was just the three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy\nWith a yeah it's a pretty messy\n[laughter] I don't go right but ... and it'll claustrophobic too I Would imagine that other people now are you were locked up in this room [noise] I'm a few people\nKnew our our editors do but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh it was it was difficult everybody you know these people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could\nWell
