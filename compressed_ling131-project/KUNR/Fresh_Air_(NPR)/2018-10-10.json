Armstrong Mike Collins and Buzz Aldrin played by Cory stall are seated together at a table at a press conference in July Nineteen sixty nine taking questions from reporters before embarking on their Apollo eleven mission to the moon\nNeil if it does turn now to go down in history what kind of thoughts you have about that one of the thought issue uh gosh suppose that flight successful we're planning on that point being successful uh [noise] I I just know how you feel about\nBeing a part of history I think I can show similar here is the responsibility but it's exciting to be first if my

[noise]\n... and the numbers sure\nWhat what fellow wouldn't want to give his wife bragging rights [noise]\nNeal when you take anything a fan of choices they force you\nDamien says oh welcome back to fresh air and congratulations on first man you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was what [laughter] why would someone who is so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut in space\nI Love the film but I was wondering like when you were offered the chance to make this film\nLove the film but I was wondering when I when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself I think had the the same sort of initial ah you know it it it didn't really line up with the sort of films I'd been making art or kind of had in my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the region Hansen's are incredible books at the movies based on it struck me as a story about dreams and uh and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar the magic terrain at least two or\nTwo whiplash in la la land and and uh but just on this kind of grand cosmic canvas and so it seemed like if if I could tell that story and tracing you know the sort of journey from the kind of intimate home life on the ground to the story of extremes of human experience out in space\nAh and we would set those up against a giant Eli D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window UC space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going\nSort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense than\nThan the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that\nLooks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the a dictionary in\nHaitian and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and Dave Scott you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try to make this physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw lap heart and question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because he started to uh apparently started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nNight when did we ain't getting ... from where we had to take a we had to take a moment\nI saw from where we had to take a we had to take a moment\nNo he got his actually all very a a word for a second or cause riots that type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much with himself as as he can ... I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ... another\nThing that adds to the whole experience I've seen this is the New Orleans I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very ... I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space capsule or at least it wasn't and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about the sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was putting space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this was freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a like\nThe spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit and an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you would actually here with with\nSort of way to augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis was a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight\nMassive puts together a press state and about the death of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't they don't masses preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um did did that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nGearing Heinz who plays about Gilbert movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh the actual sort of format in and paper um [noise] uh that you can uh again that you can find online and and the wording is is word for word\nYou can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to capture relates in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of a reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the er at the moon will know that there's some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intended that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures a could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI hang up the astronaut Neil is Neil Armstrong new at NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nAre live their lives and and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people up\nAgainst his ... he directed the new\nProvide people with my guest

we made a choice entirely anesthetic choice not a political one to focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spent about eight minutes on the litter surface we really wanted to spend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what he himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras\nFirst kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and\nThen after his famous

I didn't know about before researching those\nUm those are the things I think there were really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important

Ryan Gosling has Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the moon\nI Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that\nWith the music he plays on the way to the moon ah things where you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah okay\nSo it's it's a less Baxter piece called lunar Rhapsody ... and when I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of a genre that's been described as exotic uh\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neal Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices Sarah I'm In is incredibly like Flora and piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty ... and having that kind of transcendent experience of like\nBeing on your plate of the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\nVersion of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you [noise] I was\nHow did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually seen the Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned the Jim Hansen's book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracks of music that uh that Neal and so the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece for by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a Neal and Janet or listen to two together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know or who is a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play this track that really no one\nListening knowing image control certainly no one in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to ah\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nWhy don't we hear a little bit of a record that we've been talking about we just called minna Rhapsody\n[noise]\nAbout which is called RNA Rhapsody\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nOh [noise] oh wow [noise]\n\n\n\nThat's an interesting which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and he's in the new movie first man which is directed by ... lots of direct did la la land and where did you and also wrote and directed whiplash\nUm another thing I found remarkable was that you were working on love and land before first men but a lot of them was in turn around so like you hadn't really be done shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first men are and so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know ...\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and a three large dumped starts in and uh and during that time I\nStops and starts and and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during or after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing the alarm strong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut uh as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which they so much technical staff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nRepublicans and ... miniatures it's it's it's\nYou know raw land was a complex film but that's like the choreography and the camera work and that dreamy sequences this is like technically difficult in a in a whole other level\nI mean I uh I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was a little bit the responsibility of the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat a A N and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they'd been very helpful with us or all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a ...\nUh but knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were a going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they wanna see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just a kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under myself and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get a ride and pay proper tribute to ah to these people\n[noise]
