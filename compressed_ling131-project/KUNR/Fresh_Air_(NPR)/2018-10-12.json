it's called John Waters indecent exposure and he's the first major retrospective of his visual art in his hometown of Baltimore\nA companion catalog has been published compiling not only visuals from the works and photos of John Waters but also from other works that inspired him John Waters has been a frequent guest on fresh air in two thousand four Terry interviewed him about an exhibition at New York's new museum of contemporary art\nIt was a photographic series waters began in the early nineties\nMany of the photographs were tribute to his favorite films which not surprisingly include many old exploitation films and tawdry melodramas\nMost of the pieces Terry asked John Waters about in two thousand four also included in the new exhibit at the Baltimore museum of art including a photographic sequence from the movie Peyton place he told Teri why that Phil means so much to him\nPeyton place for for first dirty book I ever read I Love grace metallic that I've never read the book

Peyton place there isn't any sequels to it it opens up Indian summer is like a woman for\nA [laughter] but great metallic has had famous author shot of her and the lumberjack cutting the dirty ponytail sitting at the typewriter and I was obsessed I even went to her grave I went in her house where she wrote the book but Peyton place itself on the book came out I remember the ad campaign is how did they make a movie out of Peyton place or something like that\nBut when ... got to a sexual scene they would cut short cut away shot of symbolism like like if someone was frigid they'd have a frozen lake\nWhere somebody was getting turned on made show up blossom and brain so it was all Corning nature shot and it looks like bad National Geographic shots but actually it's dirty shots at what they couldn't show then\nSince you didn't feel guilty about watching things and being obsessively interesting interested in things that weren't supposed to be healthy did you go the other dimension to the line might as well plan up to the hilt and envy you know take on the pose of of the pervert [noise]\nI never thought of it that way I I I took one\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have\nAny advertising and no one knew what was what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a [laughter] I was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly\nI was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight who was gay people that didn't like other gay people able to see three [laughter] it was hippies that didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outsider group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes in in the beginning underground movies when I made them\nThey were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always by doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did and and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe\nMe that was to go over very well at the time but at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I liked Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy of how she pronounces it [noise] um so I I was I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did in your version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the will of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people that kidnapped models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player and and there's the same or divine isn't drag just weird dried but with no way gone 'cause we were trying to\nEven offend I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously and he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazine for there were many off at the time [noise] fan magazines and he starts to imagine that\nThere were many off at the time a fan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing the capital Kate I mean a pitiful version but we have the show for or we have 'em all the people that when the car we have Secret Service agents\nAnd I'm divine as waving to the crowd there are no crowds that was filmed on my parents' street and lives in Maryland I'm Maurice avenue\nAnd a and a and then it is scored to a classical music where there's one note that as the gunshot and divine crawls over the trunk of a car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphic but it was filmed so primitive Lee that's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white ah\nSixteen millimeter grainy over expose that when I took pictures on the twenty five thirty years later it began to look like the real the brutal filming them one of the most famous a millimeter movies ever\nSo I'm ... I I I did a a photo peace based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago and it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke than I Am a Carney while I Believe in the art world that the frame as the hype frame as the advertising campaign so to me it was too big for one\nWall and to go around the wall\n[laughter] I'm In and food for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with divine who and this film that you're referring to play a Jackie Kennedy devine was a very heavy man who who usually played a woman in movies and pattern himself in some of those rules on an Elizabeth Taylor\nAnd and what do you think of real drag queens at the time\nWell they were square at the time you know I think\nThe time well they were square at the time you know I think ... divine helped make drag queens a lot hip or they all wanted to be best Myers and and\n\nUm so it was they were really square they weren't happy ever\nNow all drag queens or hip I mean you see I'm at ... and they're all really found in the sense of humor and they have funny names everything\nBut but then they were very very serious I remember in Philadelphia there's a great movie called the queen about a drag beauty contest in Philadelphia oh I Know where where you live and Harlow was the winner and I'm very very famous\nA drag queen but but we used Elizabeth coffee who was at the time I'm much more ludicrous and much more\nFunny and had a sense of humor about it and used to being a drag queen of as being um comedy terrorists which I think um was much more useful in film than than just a man trying to be a pretty woman\n[noise] you know early in your career you said that you work is really about the sadness normal people feel because they're not involved in show business\n[laughter] so what he said that was\nThe ... thing I've ever said I didn't mean to be snobby ... believe that most everybody secretly imagines himself in show business and every day on their way to work for a little bit depressed because there are people are sad they're not famous America [laughter]\nI guess you really needed to be famous\nUm well I I I certainly can't complain about it\nHate to hear people that are in show business to complain about any of that kind of thing what what on earth did you pick that field to go in for if you didn't want people to\nDid you pick that field to go in for it if you didn't want people to recognize you I've I've always said that show business is filled with the most insecure people of all that that we base a life on having to get approval of strangers from everything we do over and over and over on each project\n[noise] you know in your book there are lots of skills of movies and um lots of stills from movies that were transgressions in their time or you know violating some taboo in some small way [laughter]\nYou also have failed or ... yeah but you also have a couple of photos of of ... the clowns and howdy Doody

Howard Cooper thank you [laughter] and he's a he's a designer now she's a designer who who was not known to me um\nShe's pretty famous should come to ... ... one of the first Japanese fashioned liberal for deconstructed fashion um she's been around quite some time hugely successful in Japan\nOkay you you you describe your luck as disaster at the dry cleaners [laughter]\nYeah I like her clothes she always has something the matter with him something of it so I I Love the idea when you spend more money than your shirt on an outfit for fashion no one thinks she spent money they think you got it for a nickel somewhere and her thrift shops but actually since it's on purpose it's like getting dressed and reverse\nIts sneaky fashion is wearing outfits that you liked that regular people just think it's something the matter with it and you've got a bad code on\nI mean I'm I see people in the street that are homeless than actually look like outfits that I've played a lot of money for it [laughter] and um I find that ... I I find a delightful my father used to that you bought that something that they saw your common boy but they did see me come [laughter] I was eager to get it\nOkay this is far too personal himself so I'll Try it anyway [noise] um do you like costuming when it comes to actual that\nYou mean to someone have to be in a certain outfit no I'm not out specific thank God but what somebody who was on I always really think that if boys turned their belt halfway to the right ...\nBoys turn their belt halfway to the right one for the buckle is in on the side Marlon Brando did that ... it's a look of confidence I like I like somebody that pulls often effort less look but no I I don't have to have somebody dresses an airline\nPilot for a guy and I know that I Would start laughing I was I was there something that's inherently absurd at some point\nEveryone's sacrifices funny except your own uh-huh [laughter] really it every person says and years and never it one way and that\nWell because the lengths that people go to the extremes and the conditions and the mental exercises and guilt and shame and happiness that everybody goes from what they'll do for sex is is is never ending in mind boggling and very interesting to me\nAnd um and I don't think a lotta times people choose any of it I I I'm a friend of mine I ... I think I have it in this book we're\nUm her mother had Alzheimer's and she for years so she knows a lot about Alzheimer's community and I will ask them to people forget if they're gay or straight and the workers had never once they don't know who their family is in a wreck anybody but no one suddenly doesn't remember if they're gay or straight\nWell doesn't that prove really that you're born that\nRight okay so I Want to call it something you say in the book you talk a little bit about being in therapy and you say a psychiatrist once told me early and treatment stop trying to make me like you and what a sobering welcome smack in the face that statement was yet somehow every day of my life is still a campaign for popularity or better yet a crowded funeral\nIsn't everybody in show business on the same thing that they're insecure people that have to go into a field that we're strange will have to tell them they're good for the rest of her life I figured that out a long time ago um yes I thought it was a great thing to shrink from that I'm not there to make friends\nYes I thought it was a great thing to shrink from I'm not there to make friends you're supposed to talk about the things that make them more uncomfortable what's I'm paying for this let's get my money's worth so I used to after that going to think of the things that maybe the most up to like to talk about which is what you're supposed to do with a psychiatrist [noise]\nUm I Believe in talking ... you know Freud for the best thing ever a redline that's I think for Britain is turning hysterical misery and the comment on happiness what a great great line\nBut didn't find it such a paradox and let you spelled out there that you're the person who has like defied every convention in your life and in your art the person who you say even even you're a minority group you're an outsider of\n'em and I mean you turn that into an art and and a career and yet you tried to get your psychiatrist to love you and you say that every day in your life as a campaign for popularity isn't that a paranoia\nNo I think it's probably being a healthy neurotic\nEverything that I'm running out of your own or not to clean up but only a neurotic\nCares if everyone likes them you know and and in show business certainly it isn't it a politics focusing thing you have to get people to like your\nUm and by writing books by making movies and everything I think you're continuing to do that at a crowded funeral is a nice thing I like that but the older you get the last chance that host of happening not another reason to make younger friends [laughter]\nSo they can fill in like it'd be Oscars when somebody goes to ... to have somebody to sit in the seat I Want family [laughter]\n[noise] you know because as as you've said you've made a living selling shock or will surprise surprise yeah and and some of your ... to some of your early ... does have some very like vile we you know repulsive thinking people\nSome guys have some very like vile we you know repulsive thinking people in the ...
