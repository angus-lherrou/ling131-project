and\nSo this McCarthy welcome to fresh air and love you in this new movie so congratulations on it this is a really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic dinner way\nBut I Want to call in movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent an a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise]\nI think it's a it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic place so\nI'm quite comfortable and I was kind of think if you you know\nThis was fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess is Melissa McCarthy she's starting in the new movie can you\nEver forgive me which is based on a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you're very famous for as a role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] when the bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as their ...\nThe bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink and your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can and it really wasn't a point of it oh okay no no\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film kind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this\nGrossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to determine ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause it's weird things like this do happen I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately [noise] even though we were friends with in the movie saying like oh my God\nWe were friends with in the movie saying like oh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the facts of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and\nAnd how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIt's interesting to hear you say that 'cause the second half of my question [laughter]\nWhat's going to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality by doing gross out scenes and so you're one of those really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended and it was really\nTalked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all falling said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and they think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults [laughter]\nInsulting no [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know I don't know why are you not [laughter] but but the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and lives le mans teenage kid\nYou're a teenage kid and polarizing live le mans teenage kid and it becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the the the other ... couple have threatened you so you're all just kinda going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do ... you know to know what I said was that we need to keep an extra hour and our kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them\nResponsibly no no when he when he said to me was he called me a one language Catherine language I mean I can relate to what they do not balls sent to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager ... next door so\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul was like there are bank commercial that's what you look like your bank commercial couple none of this talk\nIf productive I Would like to really enjoy my legs and kick you out in the job with my ... bone you're just really scaring me this is what happens when you corner rat you corner me I won't you drew you to certain you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this was forty uh it's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it just goes on and on with more over the top insult is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to to do really funny and sold\nSide like in the real world being able to to do really funny and solve no I Know I Do not oh go around insulting people um I Hope ever um\nI don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I got it all out on a screen but [noise]\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] I never say that\nAnd the first time a sitting with was to sit for watching you say it you said all of it and I I didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say every anything that came off the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory had you improv insults before\nYes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nOr especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just to literally say anything she used to kind of kind of tear people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authority so it was a big part of that character and you're very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\nThere is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do these things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher\nThings that you would never do your Boulder your heart sure you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh there is a there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guess is Melissa

the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did a longer time probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] it when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there was this\nComedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your\nTop off [laughter] and you're just like what like what\nDoes that ever work for you has any woman ever been like\nMy God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly each other now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting an actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um it usually would dissolve into some kind of thing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement\nOh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road if like this so surprisingly can get a show of hands for women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off like and I would do votes and then talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels bad like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what's the first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the Oscars if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there a home body there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching thing times oh my God so I Know there's\nThe light oh ... ever present uh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men\nI wouldn't flash and it's like ...\nYes and when that light flashes is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know the stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ...\nWho's ever running the night is also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a oh my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the ... other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the first time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager kind of I ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking and the light kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got off to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me a in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\nSo you don't want to know women who has taken on like producing and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act immaterial\nTo make sure that you can act immaterial that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles\n[noise] I think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read were kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it I also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with\nQuirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even dislike people think we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is and so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was really blend in and\nOften a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all\n[laughter] than I Am still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like why doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun\nIsn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer I just ... I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this because I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors\nTheir careers or at least temporarily ended because they were ousted for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger mental behavior yeah try to women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful for you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered and Hollywood now [noise]\nEvery little in ... I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that is is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and realize their strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you in your new role and\nComing on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you in your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time\n[laughter] I Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer turned literary forge or\nAfter a break John Powers will review and new BBC series about a police bodyguard assigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target it drops on Netflix Wednesday this is fresh air\nLeast it's fresh air on K you in our public radio good afternoon [noise]\nEvery night at nine or ... or on the week nights we feature a different program tonight it's reveal [noise]\nAs we approach twenty teens mid term country has its eyes locked on Georgia's governor's race [noise] it's a close contest between Stacey Adams a former state congresswoman who could become the first ever black female governor in America\nAnd Brian Kemp a tougher talking Trump loyalist with a penchant for the second amendment is race has become a battleground for many of America's most pressing concerns about democracy from voters depression to election security at nine pm tonight okay you in our revealed tackle that topic [noise]", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "22"}
