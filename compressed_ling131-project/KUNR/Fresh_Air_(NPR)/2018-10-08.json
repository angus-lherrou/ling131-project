interviewed her father and two thousand six after the publication of a book of his poems and songs\nHe asked to read a poem that he just written that hadn't yet been published but it is now published in his new book the flame so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of that home a street or from our two thousand six interview\nOr used to be your favorite drunk

it's over unless the strength to when we meet all be standing on this corner where they used to be a street\nYou left me with the dishes and a baby in the bath\nAnd you're tied with the militias I knew where they're they're kind of live\nWith I guess that makes us equal but I Want to march with you or just an extra in the sequel to the old red white and blue so let's bring to when it's over\nHe's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become misspell jacks during the ... because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate ing things whereas this man was speaking from the very run that he found himself at in life\nMe re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of ...\nMy guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard Cohen's final lyrics homes notebook injuries and drawings and these are all collected in the new book the flame and Adam Cohen wrote the introduction to it\nWhen they take a short break and then we'll

things considered on K you in our public radio from three thirty 'til six o'clock this is fresh air and\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard Cohen final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished and it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there is something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this problems I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... tone that I think he would have been fair\nOtherwise it takes a kind of ... breed of stone that I think she would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading the palms yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them I appreciate\nYou saying that his son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have that they have for his work has a life outside of his mouth\nAnd ... and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems so I've always wanted to I Want to get on record as say what I\nKnow and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in this\nI'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and or an exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry\nThat I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book and observing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time not with my meter now with my voice\nSince you've declined to read more pounds that you find that I'm going to find out I'm not being ... can tankers are intransigent\nNow it's just it's ... it's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading and not another problem with is\nFrom the interview that we recorded in the thousands sick and this is a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was kindly accorded me even though I could barely cardio June\nFor many years I was known as a month\nFor many years I was known as a month I shaved my head in war robes and got up very early I hated to everyone but I acted generously and no one found me out\nMy reputation as a ladies' man was a joke it caused me to laugh bitterly through the ten thousand nights I spent a loan\nFrom a third storey window above the puck deport you gal I've watched the snow come down all day\nAs usual there's no one here they're never is\nMercifully the inter conversation is canceled by the white noise of winter I Am neither the mind the intellect nor the silent voice within that's also castles\nAnd now gentle reader in what name in whose name do you come to Idaho with me in these luxurious and twins laying realms of aimless privacy\nI think that palm Adam gets a little ... where you were talking about the connection of your father riding in solitude and we're re reading alone and has his [laughter] and during his talented yeah\nYou noted also kind of a of humor you know I mean I remember I Love when of his lines where he says uh feel so good not to love you like I did it's like they tore away my blindfold and said we're going to let this prisoner live [laughter] that that was hilarious my guess is Adam\nPrisoner live for those who are is\nMy guest is Adam Cohen he's

Marion here that's nowhere to say goodbye burn on a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear what you do if you didn't meet me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs and singers\nBut I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what's the sun and who's singing it um but but you were you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did\nAnd the ... like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course that her them you know I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed of course looking out into the looking at its faces of of audiences or you know in in different times\nBecause of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\nAnd you grow older and then you then you sort of see how remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nAnd we were sitting on the corner of Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record\nAnd was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and he's grab your record that's an amateur move\nSaid amateur move he said yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um\nThe love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but it was also about their intention out he was holding up the baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that is always\n[noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh\nThat baton off the ground [noise] were you and your parents separated um five six and ... the don't remember how much did you get to see us either after that\nIn a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father\nWas able to stay in his children's life\nDespite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me um I my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow our own whims\nAnd uh my father you know would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nVeto he's he always maintained a role um in in our lives despite my parents' separation\n... like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the liquid you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nYeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to the south of France where we lived a and there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things he put at the at the tea where the road met the dirt road and he just\nT where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh [noise] you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead in his care of and how long did that for\nWhat he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and\nAs I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate this with which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own way as maybe responsible for the revival of his career and for for\nUm his reconnection to people [noise] um I ... around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father son that's kinda like stealing is sold to sell all the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think it's your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] yeah you know\nHe often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry I'm an incredible that [laughter] that with the canon of his work with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the\nThis uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis a rose this most unexpected in\nFestive of periods in his life I Want to say festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities to suddenly started teaching is works I'm studying is works or even read the whole rabbinical clan adopting his
