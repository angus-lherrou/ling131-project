how do we decide who to believe when a woman say she was sexually assaulted by someone she knows behind a closed door and the man denies that\nThat's an issue university is I've been grappling with\nMy guest Vanessa ... is the author of blurred lines sex power and consent on campus over the course of three years she interviewed a hundred twenty students from twenty universities spoke with nearly eighty administrators and experts and read dozens of case reports\nWith nearly eighty administrators and experts and read dozens of case reports\nShe says that while writing the book she witnessed a historic moment when survivors move from the shadows to the spotlight first on campus and then nationwide with me too movement Google Riyadh is is a contributing editor at the New York times magazine in Vanity Fair and has won a national magazine award\nVanessa grigorian artist welcome to fresh air you know you write in your book that there's a new understanding of what rape and sexual assault means that started on college campuses but with me too movement it's spread beyond campuses\nWhat'd you Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation tell you about how far that new understanding has spread I guess what I'm asking you is this if if the Republican senators in the Judiciary Committee had gone to college campuses\nWhat'd you think some of the things or they would have been told about ... what to take into consideration before voting\nThings that they might not have thought of in part by us the Republicans on judiciary were men a lot of them are older men if you know their college days were very different in terms of thinking about sexual assault\nIt's so senators had um ban on college campuses as presidents or administrators or title nine officers they would have had a completely different set of questions right because they would have already known what college campuses no about sexual assault which is\nVery few women make it up very few women are excited to get

President Trump spoke to reporters on the south lawn of the White House before boarding a flight theirs was October second\nAnd so this this was before the Senate voted on Kavanaugh's nomination for

guilty of which is a very very very difficult time [noise]\nComing up at three thirty all things considered and an interview was Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the latest on hurricane Michael and an interesting feature on Donald Trump or president and music star Kanye West all of that coming up on all things considered with your host Dana O'Connor on kill you in our [noise]\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with ... author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nSexual assault but maybe it had to be penetration 'em by the end of those three years that I deal with completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you abreast son people in speech and make them feel like justice uh like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line and about this issue I understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but\nI think that part of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition [noise]\nSo um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something I guess means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now I guess you know in the college definition could be\nYou know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown or pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at this in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why were you resistance to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sex is something that is ... book\nAnd that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways one it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people home that's part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that a question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know\nAll I'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always kind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an extra question\n... you rented the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness when do you mean\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well\nMaybe another time uh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until the end up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to fix this problem is about\nGirls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get out\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like\nRules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever\nUm but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances and you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the rich\nStop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward and it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person having the full burden of the awkwardness exactly so this is a little ...\nOkay fine you it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance in may\nRecently you know guys tried to come up and dance with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] no I mean why his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent I'm I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked\nWas that the first time that happened here that was definitely the first time in fact it up for it to me\nI mean I ... yeah I I didn't think that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him and Mary and I'm I was just there with my girlfriends
