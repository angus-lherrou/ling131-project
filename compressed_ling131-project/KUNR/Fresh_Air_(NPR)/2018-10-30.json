anywhere I have no money no connections\nJonah Hill welcome to fresh air congratulations on a movie what did skateboarding mean to you when you were in your teens\nI'm no ambassador for skateboarding and skateboarding is so sensitive to being portrayed in film by outsiders\nAnd that's understandable because it's often butchered but when I was maybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more in my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness I don't know just laid an imprint on me\nSo I'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with or aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I was always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain skateboarding achievements that just I don't think are physically possible for me at this point at thirty four I filmed a lot\nOf the ... that you're in like you weren't going to be a great skateboard her but\nI guess actually okay and I loved it and it was there\nOkay and I loved it and it was there was this bombastic personality such twisted sense of humor now with a twenty year lens on it having written this film\nHe really showed me you know a lot of what I think was great about it and what are things that I had to and people from that time had to unlearn\nWhat are some things you felt you had to learn from the culture the way people spoke to one another and what they said to one another especially in regards to homophobia and toxic masculinity\nMore emotional [laughter] good for you [laughter]\nYeah I'm\nI'm at my scars on cars are inside [laughter] ... yeah and just the general recklessness which are related to you and I related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that Comey is has deep flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up in and learn some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now\n[noise] ah yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay I shouldn't use the word dream would you unreality [laughter] every considered an escape or now I landed\nA cake foot in front of our cast and crew in order just add of being so exciting exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that this is something that at one point was a massive part of my life let's say\nAt one point was a massive part of my life\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation it's said among a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll be right back\nAnd we'll talk about some of the films he starred in\nAfter the break this is fresh air\n[noise] good afternoon you're listening to fresh air on kill you in our I'm Duncan Stewart nice to be with you today you would argue that support from the Nevada department of conservation and natural resources reminding the bad news that\nThe better indeed does blood are you prepared you can find out of your home is in a flood prone area\nAt Nevada floods dot org again that's Nevada floods dot org\nCheese\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting then\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early scrap\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter of certain\nDid I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter if certain [laughter] but I maybe should have waited till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age because my dad's favorite movie and I wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten that I think is a\nI I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho is who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don\nNo excuse me she's Michael Sallah OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight of Homer and\nNo Homer see that would be but that would make Marge Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nAs Diane Keaton like [laughter] when are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but uh Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were Lenny was Frito and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the M fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who ended his too\nWho would be the character equivalent of who ...\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film like I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise]\nUm they said we're so mean you you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange\nWell kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminal movie in my life kids with a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down and this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it um a friend of mine who ... who was older had both cassettes at his house\n... who was older had both cassettes at his house and I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York\nI completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot ... part of the film couldn't win over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk to [laughter] it's like\nYou know like a laughing when he was tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to them about what I had seen what shape you also asked about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was too heavy so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this stuff for a reason yeah and then I of course didn't for many many years and ... they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nActing career says that when I really dissect it as well\nI guess this Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in their mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American whose murder

fascinating stories coming up at ten o'clock on K you in are\nAnd and now and like in the past I don't know ... years five six seven years you've started playing more dramatic roles\nYou know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part in Cyrus which is a film that I Love that um was a great experience with John she Riley ... told me\nAnd then and Catherine Keener and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and cast me money ball\nAnd then in the interim a\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun and then uh I had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nIf I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry Levinson or people that started out in comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life [noise] why don't we hear a scene\nFrom a Wolf of Wall Street which was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire and\nSo this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny Adolf played by you\nWho eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting\nUm so you start the scene\nSuch a gun laws [noise]\n\nSomebody's Ryan ...\nCounties don't take it was ... as you don't you\nDare I say I guess you call around\nThe only thing I think we live in this day and building\nTwelfth floor

to to say how much money [noise]\nIf I told you [noise] Seventy thousand technically Seventy two thousand [noise]\nYou show me a paste up or Seventy two thousand dollars on it I quit my job right now and I worked for you [noise]\nNow everything's fine hey listen I quit any deep quit his job at all which I thought it was a little weird I mean\nIt was a little weird I mean I just met this\nGets officers as out of a business so all the things about him to like his phosphorus and white T if I got to deal with your wife back to one rooms with clear lenses just to look more wasp [noise]\n[laughter] okay so that's a theme Leonardo DiCaprio and my guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on offer philosophy\nIs going to see so many things I guess the main lesson I learned\nWas that it's okay not to judge or characters to just show their behavior as people and the characters in his films often do really ugly things and you still find humanity in there and\nI like how\nUnabashedly an unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse which is something\nYou've tried to do when you're in a movie\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to meet in art in general and something I'm going to strive to do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties if we don't want to be back to The Simpsons I mean our country\nHas a terrible father right wing it terrible father [laughter] you can't be viewed but he also incidentally loving big hearted\nPerson right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area\nSo this weekend the Saturday you're going to host Saturday Night live November third something\nYou're going to host Saturday Night live November third so I'm going to play an excerpt of a Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most took me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played a six year old who's with a step mother\nAt a vending hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insult directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by Vanessa bear and she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nInappropriate inappropriate you listening to NPR drive over not my nightmares what took place in Syria and stalked Terry Gross\nTo do that maybe could still do not want to train whistle every one of the time [noise]\nOkay and you say [laughter] I was shocked and I live in the name check I you know on the show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous to here at this moment\nOh it's just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that he has to listen to NPR boring to a kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show was such detail and understanding\nBut that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first um this'll be my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise]\nUm [noise] and I was at\nTwenty three or something [noise] um\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Eddie Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there and\nA bill hatred told a story about a go into a Benny ... in his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter] and\nWhen the when the chef did his trick the kid lean back in ... one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style and I think I just started\nDoing the kid is if he was like an old Catskills comedian and then that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that has a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times well\nJonah Hill thank you so much for coming on the show it's it's been great to talk with you thank you to\nJonah Hill wrote and directed the new film mid nineties\nAfter we take
