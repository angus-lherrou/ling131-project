Blacksburg who's also the show runner seasons five is now a net flicks Comedy Central is now showing the first season\nThe series satirized has Hollywood and deals with issues like access and failure ego power addiction relationships and sexism\nSeason five is set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that's a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics\nBow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBut when season one of Bo jak horsemen begins bow jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and he spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of his sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then\nLet's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on the Charlie Rose show\nNineteen any simple situation comedy ocean around me or don't ABC Show which young bachelor horses are forced to reevaluate its priorities we agree to raise three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and suffering and not good\nBut the family comedy struggle with America Alone to air for nine seasons star of horses around ... force or against my will\nJack forced to our guest ... ... it\nIs good to be here too early\n[laughter] okay ... Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\nYou know it's slim wearing leader you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job [laughter]\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode when the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know look at bow jak who is such a mess and all of the Rio and unprofessional and Charlie Rose or played in in this clip by patent Oswald is are are straight person in the scene\nAnd uh you know when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause it wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it it is interesting now to to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and have him be the washed up star of the family sitcom\nWell the idea for the show really started from my friendship with Lisa ... who was a brilliant illustrator and cartoonist and I have been friends with her since high school I\nMean when I was you know in Los Angeles pitching shows around um she was living in\nAnd and oh jak isn't such despair afterwards and feels so responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWhere I Would say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt plausible deniability or he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a ... maybe minor distinction to us that he is soldiers bonded and despairing but he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to active we do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one long monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at a Mike her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and this is will or not\n... and this is well are not as much jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around seriously though hold your applause\nWell held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah Lynn\nAnd it was about these orphans and early on the network had a note maybe don't mention they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they couldn't imagine their parents to be anything they wanted they had something to lung for\nAny way we did this one season finale where Olivia's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got her self cleaned up and she was being Olivia's life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted in any way that words tries to want to be careful\nMoms have a way of letting you down but Olivia\nJust thinks the horses jealous and when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced the cliffhanger ... gone for good and\nThat of course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. out in the cast of stop of course that's what happened because what are you going to do is just not handled Libya on this show\nYou can't have happy endings sitcoms not really because if everyone's happy to show it would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horse in around\nThere's always more show and you can call horse in around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broken your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip\nThat um he indeed are are fans because they could imagine their parents any way they wanted to [noise] um what made you think about that well\nYou know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think\nWhat's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe on a personal level level that nobody is era dean ... or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven\nDawn that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven and how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've hurts so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how to reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a ... a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement was so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the the richer you un the writers is do we forgive you awards you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the ... election\nBut we forgive you rewards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a a ... we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is that our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and the rate was kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized that and then over the course of ...\nRight and we wanted to satirized that and then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry\nAnd then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we'll forgive me\nI don't know maybe this is sadly relevance a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture\nNews when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years what makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn miss defies me in this area that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nThat it still feels like we are not you know Louis C K A stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation a there are reports that Garrison Keillor and and Matt Lauer planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do\nCome back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards\nProfessional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I found it tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is Rafi ... the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series bull jak horsemen after a break he'll tell us why he had second thoughts about some of the jokes from season one\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new collection of Eleanor Roosevelt advice columns I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air

S. um sounds a little bit about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the um bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never once felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of minorities that were chips um we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that's as happy Halloween cause it's missing an end\nHanukkah that says happy Halloween because it's missing an end to have the the misfit toys or Monica um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life um and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas a disconnect between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nUm and\nIt's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage\nUm and that's been very scary to me\nUh but also scary how little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who you know as a Jew hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up\nAnd the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know officially one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years ago to be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was a difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I I can always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested in me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience that I Love making\nThe center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience and I love making people laugh but a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize it inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy you're pushing the boundaries I did because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just\nA shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and save the funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a sentence has been a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference when you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing there for you or this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas\nDoing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have you know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps in what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space for you or you could like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of\nWhat you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there's so many pop culture references and bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and they happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nUm so it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nWell TV made sense to me and you know there was a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this seem that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful as being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and I'll have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or\nAnd I have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think of a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or someone came in here and did this I can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll\nI'll get paid for by putting into the story later so having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central and is running bow jak witches and Netflix series now the comedy central is rain yet starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you because you in retrospect for like some of the jokes and season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks and making under the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to\nKeep their dignity\nAs an up sort of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this scene work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but I also think look this is the show and\nIt has to do exist on its own terms and hopefully people you know as they have embraced the show on Netflix will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will see those laws for what they are\nAnd you know we'll see what happens\nWhen it's been great to talk with you thank you so much it is my pleasure thank you so much\n...
