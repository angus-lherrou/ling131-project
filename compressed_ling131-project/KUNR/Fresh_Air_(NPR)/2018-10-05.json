very unknown I'm part of my life unknown to me um complicated and confusing and very vulnerable\nUm but it was sort of talked into it I I was talked into trying it and I liked the footage that I saw and I liked it\nAnd I liked the footage that I saw and I liked the directors and filmmakers that I was working with\nAnd that the especially the camera man he had done dance films before so it was very comfortable he knew exactly how to move in the studio or wherever I was with me and because it was such a difficult time it turned into supportive thing in a way it was\nAt times irritating to

September eleventh two thousand twelve [noise] and um I knew something had happened it was the smallest slip and um but I felt it deep in my the back of my hips hamstring area [noise]\nAnd I thought oh I tore my hamstring or I pulled my ... I didn't imagine it would be a terror and I couldn't do certain dances that season I did some I didn't do the ones I was really well known for and wanted to do\nAnd I waited a few months um didn't stretch it still danced but just at a certain level and then within\nThree months I could include physician\nAnd fifth position if you don't know ballet is the base of ballet it's the most\nBasic position that everything moved from and I literally couldn't do that [noise]\nSo that was a big shock and I tried everything I tried acupuncture I tried I was going to therapy I tried massage I tried everything you can imagine had injections um MRI's I'm an MRI came back and said there was inflammation in my head\nSo I had my hip drained and the doctor\n[noise] and the doctor also did an

the source of your work the source of your identity as a dancer and it's also just like your home I mean we all live in our bodies but your body it was like a very special body\nDefinitely it was my home it was my best friend [laughter] you know and we could talk we could fight and uh we always found way to make peace um throughout my career um\nYou know it started to tell me what to do and I stopped demanding from it\nSo I had to soften up and empathize with my body and have a little more compassion for it and be grateful for what it did give me which was a phenomenal thirty year career with arguably the best company in the world\nYou know a lot of people think ballet as being um the ultimate in like\nFemininity in like [laughter] things kind of femininity like really to to your
