author of a biography of Lou Reed which just came out in paperback\nDo Curtis is a contributing editor for Rolling Stone where he's written for more than thirty five years to Curtis new read and considered him a friend although not a close one\nAs part of his research the Curtis interviewed many people read new including his first two wives Lou Reed cofounded the velvet underground which you played with from Nineteen sixty four to Nineteen Seventy\nThe band was initially managed by Andy Warhol and was part of Warhol seen on many bands of the time or singing about peace love and losing the Gen x Lou Reed was writing songs about heroin street hustler and transcripts of sexuality he continued in that direction as a solo artist\nBut he also wrote sons that had a spiritual quality\nTo

Lou the way he wanted to see himself\nAspects of their sex life his drug use and his cruelty that he came to be embarrassed about our discussion here in detail as our his generosity and his kindness his talent his vision and his genius unquote\nWe recorded the interview last November when the book was first published and started with the sun heroin from the velvet underground first album\nMm\nMm\nMm\nMm\nMm\nMm\nMm Mm\nMm [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nLou Reed and Anthony Curtis welcome to fresh air and congratulations on your new biography of Louis read 'em or two from Audrey propose your beer\nA biography of lead on like you so much it's a pleasure to be here so let's start with that song which sums up so much about what may may Lou Reed different from other means Hank\n... being made at at that time um give us your take on heroin and how it fits into not only leads career but into the larger music of that time\nEden of peace and you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to go to bars and acting out as a gay person\nYou know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nAs we mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I well yeah\nThat's true and that and there are people I mean this was a really I mean it's a very it's an issue very much of the moment interestingly because I'm kind of gone around the block\nSee anything he was on a like flu it in his actual alley yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's ah describes him as inter and [laughter] it's a kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of loop but he was really gay and the other day I got one of those and it was you know what\nHe was really gay and you know the day I got one of those and it was you know as a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you gauge the adage you so you wanted to see you know and I I think Louis kind of open to going wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for it then well that's right they didn't that language didn't exist if I did one guy I just want to say one\nThing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that but when he left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI have a price on Iran I ... yeah\nKnow and and ah I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap introducing a guy ever wanted to spend money we were living in these all of these small places you would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took lose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said well with his father ever have given their money and she said of course he would have given him money\nYou know it does anything for the you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and you know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what\nLose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whenever Lou needed anything he was there and you know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nBlue dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister you know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a you know as it might initially seem\nAnother thing that really just like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own he didn't have any money not eat set so he got a job working for his father typing up in his father's accounting office yes extending have trans grass have is that [laughter]\nI Try to let it they don't have any I always see what's hey guys you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to buy time in making money and if they were ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the NYPD Blue quit the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they kind of relationship it was a\nYou know along with\nA you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names that was never like mom and dad um and you know he certainly would characterize them in song\nYou know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl but ah yeah but in real life you you know got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet\nFairly well so early\nIn the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of yeah the kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what works and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for an lead\nLet's you know that's very interesting question because you know um [noise]\nYeah ... ... or ... Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular and you know just going to make some movies now and you know it says like we should have a bad you know rock and roll is getting to be a thing and\nSo they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know and you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for handy\nUm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio\nDecided that the the velvet underground we're kind of too boring looking so they got Nico yeah who is a you know a German model an actress and soon to be finger to you know to be their lead singer Lewis not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of visibility\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with that he limited Nico was participation as much as he could you know um she only saying you know a few songs or the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the\nNico you know like that is she's not a member of the band and as soon as he could he got ... you know he kick Nicola the band as well after having an affair with her well that's very true [laughter] exactly it was you know part of those times\nUm and that was a you know so that was one of the issues of Warhol a Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time more who was in the newspapers all the time if not\nYou know not art critics reading about it although that too but it's just like a this crazy guy you know he thinks that Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspaper so whatever he did got attention\nAnd ah you know Lou took advantage of that but that also hurt the velvet underground in that\nYou know rock and roll certainly back then was pretty Ernest thing and the ... were whole seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a band you know for for people who deal had entered them yet you know unheard of amazing they are so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think\nLou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go I you know this needs to be more professional operation and you know there's no way Andy Warhol was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nGas is Anthony ... is the author of the books we read a life it's just been published in paperback after a break what's happened that region\nLife it's just been published in paperback after a break we'll talk about ...

with you we get support from the Unitarian universal fellowship holding\nHis self image and his persona\nWell you know Lou how complicated feelings about that um you know at the time it was a big opportunity I mean David Bowie was kind of the you know the coming thing and uh you know bully you\nKnow has with flu like there was a very conventional aspect of but we I mean much as he was a boundary breaker he always you know kind of respected his elders we do and and the people who had an important influence on him and Lou Reed was right at the top of that list\nAnd so she you know but we offered to produce transformer and restored\nYou know lose standing after the village\nRestored you know lose standing after the velvet underground and created a solo career for him and gave him his only hit 'em they'll walk on the wall side was on that record 'em you know so\nLittle of course yeah once you got to hit that he desperately wanted your kind of came to resented and you know thought of it as um you know just to kind of pop song and why do people sort of reduced me too that\nUh but at the time that he needed it he really needed it and he really wanted it and I'm ... and ... guitar player ... who co produced that album with a with with David\nUh they created that song and also you know ... other beautiful songs like you know perfect day and satellite of love that are that are on that record and uh you know made it such a you know such a significant album for Lu\nWanna walk on that ... from that album and um this was his only real like radio hit and it was a big ... I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some other trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about it and\n...\nCame from Miami and build a [noise] little Fitch heights away across us they\nLoved her eyebrows on the way to shave their legs and then he was a she and she says the they\nTake a walk in the wild and said hey honey take a walk in the wild uh\nThey take a walk in the wild uh\n[noise]\nCandy came from now on the island is\nActually read walk on the wild side they're on his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm so that so that was actually had friendly but I got I got from your book like this attack he wanted to hit so badly finally has run and he sounds like it was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you don't look Lou Reed grew up in an era where there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible they're good to be a rock band had have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou don't know exactly what the mortgage company that is that yeah yeah precisely and even if you did have hits you know you\nGot a year or two and then you went home but\nUm you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as want us to do serious things and and take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you\nKnow the record companies like oh okay great we've got to hit like now let's do take another walk on the wall side or walk on the website again and that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified a you know later\nIt's at the time was vilified ah you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh I live in a heist but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and a crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing record 'em\nSo you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever you needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once he had destroyed his daddy you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career was just an hour of just\nYou know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that woods unsinkable before Lou did it\nAnd I'm just a little Internet minded he wanted to have his music reach people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nExactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter]\nHonestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um so I'm In his album St hassle you you say that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed [noise] um well\nOne thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a ...\nShip with Rachel which was a which is documented quite movingly in the song street hustler part called slip away wearing you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview on you know at that time you know said\nYou know that was real she did that I mean essentially you know saying like Rachel you stole whatever jewelry was around and took off\nAnd [noise] um I think\nThey had been falling apart there's some lots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of\nI'm Rachel want me to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is who became his second wife and you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was\nUm [noise]\nYou know over the course of two or three years Luke got clean a got straight\nAnd um and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there'll be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be he also turned on it\nAnd are often not with that you know that much um\nWith that you know that much um [noise] bitterness but uh but still we would never discuss it\n[noise] you know so I I Want to play a different excerpt of St ... the ... not the slip away part that you referred to sure where the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so cold just so indifferent about it it's almost upsetting to listen to but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great writing [noise]\nUm so ... there's the middle part [laughter] a a street hassle joined us anything about this that's part yeah I'm\nLewis drawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead\nOr industry or as an thought to be kind of that he was hit by a car I mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was that he had died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they dragged him out onto the street and just left him by the docks\nI'm as if he had you know had an accident of some kind\nI'm Lou turns that male character into a female character and then you know describes the guy who was the host of the party 'em urging his guests to get this girl's body out of his apartment [noise]\nLet's hear it this is Lou Reed [noise]\nYou know in Bolivia weaving in and then you
