back to the program\nThank you Rachel and think thank you for having me on\nI Want to start from the beginning that night where were you when you found out about the shooting well\nIt's it's a kind of a long story but I'll get give you the Reader's Digest version I it was a special day to me I grew up in\nMinnesota playing hockey all my life and in\nLas Vegas finally got a professional sports team so it was I was going to attend my very first Golden Knights game on Sunday October first at five PM so a friend of mine and I we took a took a neighbor down to the strip and ah we walked over to the hockey game and in to the unique part of that as we were going to meet a friend\nAt the hockey game and he had tickets to the to the concert and\nSo we had planned on after the hockey game we were going to go over to the ...\nPlanned on after the hockey game we were going to go over to the route Ninety One festival and he ended up not being able to come to the hockey game so therefore we didn't go to the festival so [noise]\nUm that was ended up being a good thing but I I so I went to the my very first Las Vegas nights game on that day so it was kind of a special memorable day needless to say\nMhm what was your first phone call you received if something happened\nIf I was actually in a new job or on my way home and it was just after ten PM and and I received a somewhat frantic call from one of our investigators a we have a a medical legal investigators in our office in one of our investigators called me and\nAnd um the the thing that I remember so vividly about that phone call was was that I could hurt she are investigators have a police radios that have police scanning capability\nAnd when she called me the first thing she said was we have an active shooter at the Mandalay Bay and and they they know of at least twenty dead at the moment\nAnd um I could actually hear the gunfire uh being broadcast through her radio and through my phone so it was that early when I got the call on on my way home from the Las Vegas nights game\nOkay so after you got that call and what did you do\nI continued on home and uh um I got home I had been up since about five thirty AM so I knew was going to be a long night I got in the shower just a freshman up and made a cup of coffee and I I packed a bag I I called a colleague of mine um um who\nOf mine um um who would escort me down to the scene and and helped me a a really started deploying all of our resources so [noise] um she came and picked me up and we had a down to the scene and we got there or just to read around one thirty AM\nAnd uh met with the the under sheriff actually are under sheriff McMahon who I met with him at the south central area command and we talk briefly in and we had it into the scene and and started deploying our resources\nYou work around gas every day but before you left the house that night even though you might not have fully known 'em the full picture of what had happened did you have to prepare yourself for what you were about to deal with\nIt you know I I did I I we've been very lucky we've we've done a lot of mass fatality preparedness training over the years so it wasn't a secret of how this was going to change our office and really change our lives and and we knew that and and we know\nThat when an office when a coroner's office is deal with something like this it's going to really affect them in a major way so we we we were prepared for it we um you know as prepared as we could be you can never be prepared for something like this but we knew that it was a big deal and it was going to really require a lot in the in the coming months\nWhen you got to the concert ground can you describe a little down what you saw sure sure you know\nFirst of all we we drove and we ended up driving in a north bound\nUp driving in a north bound from South of the venue and\nWhen we were driving in Las Vegas boulevard was closed ... obviously but there were still people walking away from from the venue and in some of which had blood on their clothing so it was quite an eerie\nEerie scene or when we actually went into the venue um it became even more area was like everybody just vanished all at once there was still\nFood on the barbecue and they were still fresh drinks on the bars there was a just a it was very Wendy that night so there was a kind of a wave of water bottles and red solo cups that would hit us in the\n[noise] did you feel a lot of pressure from family members of victims law enforcement media at a lot of pressure knowing that everything was going to be scrutinized that much more because of you know the gravity of this event\nThere's I I don't think it's it's a I'd be lying to myself\nI I don't think it's it's a I'd be lying to myself if I didn't say there was an additional level of pressure are handling this incident but uh\nBut as I said our staff I mean every everybody from the administrative staff to the forensic staff the investigators are doctors or just an amazing group of people and they took the brunt of the work obviously they're the ones that do the work and\nAnd they helped me so much and and uh that pressure it became a lot easier with with the ... the group of people that we\nHave to ask after something like this happening but it make you want to move out of our state is\nNo snow or you know ironically enough on the contrary I think it made me want to stay in Las Vegas I I have\nNearly twenty eight years and the retirement system and in two years I can retire if I wanted to and and you know kind of always planned maybe retiring at that point may be moving somewhere and and\nSomewhere other than Las Vegas I have a daughter who's going to be in college by then and a lot of that would be dependent on where she goes but uh\nThis I think this incident it made me want to stay in Las Vegas I don't want to retire and two years I Want to keep working and and there's a lot of\nExciting things that have come from this um need to say like that but I I think that most people I talked to agree that this is kind of changed the face of Las Vegas you know it's it's become more of a\nMore of a community to me at least and I think a lot of people that I've talked to share that sentiment that it's it's really pulled our community together that may sound a little bit corny but I I think it really hasn't it certainly has for me I I\nThink it really hasn't it certainly has for me I I ... I may never leave Las Vegas I I've lived here nearly Thirty years now and and I love it more now than I did Thirty years ago so I'm I'm planning on staying and I'd like to\nYou know if if they're willing to keep me I'd I'd like to stay stay the coroner for as long as I can I I Love the job it's a great job and I and I don't plan on going anywhere\nNow today is October first and I believe there is a a deadline to register for victims assistance today that's correct\nThank you and and what that is is it's a\nVictims of the incident I'm as well as first responders who were there that night and I'm responded to the incident in in any way shape or form\nAre eligible for a few different things one is the the victims themselves are eligible for for victims of crime benefits and\nYou know not only are they eligible for the victims of crime compensation but um but as importantly there's there's mental health services that they may be able to access if they register now that the all of that should be covered I'm there shouldn't be any financial burden on them to seek those services\nHave you been back to those concept grounds consent night\nI have not no and I and I really don't care to be a a I've driven down the strip or several times and in the last time I was there the fences were still up I don't know what it looks like now but no I haven't been down there\nJohn ... is the Clark County coroner he and his team handled the fifty eight victims in the aftermath of the October ...\nHe ... he and his team handled the fifty eight victims in the aftermath of the October first shooting John ... thank you so much thank you there is more conversation I had this state of matter\n\nGood afternoon you're listening to KU when our eighty eight point seven\nThe problem in state of Nevada for my partner's station KNPR in Las Vegas today and tomorrow at this time we're taking a look at the anniversary of the shooting in Las Vegas [noise]\nAll of us here at the one I Want you know you're in our thoughts and prayers if you are in fact suffering from the effects of this shooting [noise]\nComing up and all things considered tonight there will also be taking a look at the Las Vegas shooting including a chat with their survivors who started a support group\nTo help all of her\nFellow victims feel a local reporter Holly Hudson and talked to a survivor and you can find that\nReport advocate you went heart Don Oregon\nThat's K.

I've been to the human guard and a couple of times that I'm just going to say it's really cool but I Want you to describe it a little bit better than that for listeners\nThe garden is I don't even know if there's a way to describe it that even does it justice other than going there really it it it's it's a small but mighty\nFor sure there are fifty trees one for each victim of that night and it\nIs the truth about him in a community garden every time you go you're going to find something different every time you go you're going to see something new people are constantly coming and bringing in tokens\nOf remembrance of love of hope and everything like that from rocks to ornaments to be on the trees from pictures of their loved ones that were lost that night and letters and\nIt's hard to go there without feeling the love and the loss and to have some tears and your eyes but then to also realize that as a community we've stayed together really really strong and we're not forgetting what happened and we're still holding these people very true in near and dear to our hearts\nAnd it is completely covered with the things you're talking about the rocks the letters the ornaments and I've been there I've seen people sitting and looking at it with tears in their eyes or what kind of Russian do you see when you go there\nThat's exactly what I see people come with lots of different intense a lot of survivors come there as a place to\nFeeling it it gives them a place of quiet and solace just to be able to sit and reflects on what happened and just being able to remember and to be grateful that they are still here and to burst\nThat they are still here and to respect those that lost their lives that night others come because they just want to pay their respects there's there's definitely a lot of tears but there's also a lot of smiles and there's a lot of hope and every time we have an event out there\nFrom all volunteer event that we've had in the past or when we do have whatever we have going on the hugs and the laughter and the smiles even if they are through to your field eyes are very very prevalent and that's what's very strong about that place\nI'm Talking to Jessica Anderson of get outdoors Nevada which maintains the healing garden memorial for victims of the October first shooting the memorial is in downtown Las Vegas\nThose victims will be remembered memorial tonight and into October at the court County Museum and the court county government center Cynthia Sanford is registrar of the court County Museum Cynthia welcome back Hi thanks for having me\nSix months after the shooting the museum had catalogued about five thousand of the nearly twenty thousand items left behind those numbers stand today\nI Am so lucky that I have a dedicated group of volunteers who are helping catalog photograph and re how's all these items just last month we catalogued are Fifteen thousand artifact we're getting very close to being finished\nIt's been much faster than I thought and it's gone so much better than I'd I'd planned I plan to years maybe to work on this but here it's been a year and we're almost done\nAnd racial the same question to you or how quickly where you sent to Las Vegas\n[noise] um I wasn't quite as quick off the block the genocide I was actually based in San Francisco at a time and I also had gone to bed I'm just before the match what had happened and when I got up the next morning down with a fiery of messy\nI'm just before the match what had happened and when I called up the next morning with a fiery of messages that had come in from Australia and not and I was dispatched sort of mid morning and so I recall arriving in Las Vegas around Monday lunch time\nSo you both had a lot to sort through when you got here when you first run Jennifer what did you do to get your bearings\nIt was clear I Believe at that point it was clear that there had been dozens I don't remember if we knew the number even at that point that it was but it was really a mass casualty situation and the first thing I wanted to do was to get two witnesses so I left the airport car rental and headed state street for the strip\nUm I got as close as I could by the time I got there there was already sort of an media\nUm [noise] how a bunch of cameras and people at the end of the strip and got out of my car and started walking and by that time people were just starting to trickle through people who had been um you know all over the place in in hospitals in fast food joints\nAll over we're starting to trickle back um I remember spending several\nMaybe half an hour or so at the fast food restaurant at the end there I'm just talking with people and then just walk in and people were just willing everybody almost without exception when just willing to talk and almost eager to talk about what they had seen\n'em and that was really the first thing I Need to do is try to understand what people had witnessed\nAnd Rachel how about yourself what was it like and what did you do first when you got her\n... when I landed I I went to the Mandalay Bay just to sort of get my bearings I wanted to see the same and it was quite eerie I'm walking out the front of a hotel and I could see the plane that window and it was almost no one walking around the fun of the hotel\nAnd then I took a walk down the strip just to see what was closed down where people where but my main party when I first landed was to find out if there were any straddling victims of this news and big events that happened I was ... home to travel a lot and tend to leave a lot of this\nStrolling victims that this how often they use in big events that happened I was ... tend to travel a lot and tend to leave a lot as a safe so I recall just hitting the fines with the various hospitals and driving to a couple of hospitals just China now down if they were ... million victims or any\nAs trailing involved I'm On the periphery that was my main party and they need a message I think by about the end of the Monday or perhaps even the next day that thankfully they went out with friends involved [noise]\nAnd then I was able to sort of step back a little bit and focus on more the bigger picture and try sold them to witnesses and keeping up to date with a police development\nAnd regional when you talk to people I Wonder did you give us a sense for the mood of the city I I don't know if it's different from other things that you've covered but what was it like to be here and what was it like to talk to people\nIt it was a really strange mood it was really eerie\nSaying the strip just absolutely disastrous ed but thing going inside the Mandalay Bay hotel and saying the casinos full packed in saying people still having the holidays and sitting at ... machines and and doing what they would be doing on any other job in Las Vegas I guess it's quite rare\nFor me coming from Australia and he said that was quite ... to ... stop but even more red to be covering such a huge mass tragedy happening in such a place of hidden in them I guess it was just it was we had to say that I guess doesn't just withdraw almost everyone has their own holiday to have a good time\n...\nYeah the ... the hotel was packed when I arrived um I think I think from what I what promote people were telling me it was definitely a lot more subdued than it was a quieter and a lot of shows were cancelled and a lot of people with the re considering whether they want it to keep staying there for that holiday bought in a lot of aspects\nIt just seemed quite normal that it was just another day in Vegas to me\nAnd Jennifer you actually checked into the Mandalay Bay hotel at one point you strolled into the employees area how did you do that it won't ... after [noise]\nAt one point you strolled into the employees area how did you do that ... what were you after\nOne of the things that I was trying to find out was about the suspect in sort of what his life had been like we knew fairly quickly that he had been a sort of high roller and we wanted to know what the staff knew about him and so I was looking to staff members who are willing to talk with me\nAnd several people that I had talked early that morning were shaking and feeling sort of unsure about what the hotel but what MGM\nWas going to offer them in terms of support in terms of information anything like that so there was sort of a willingness to talk and so I wanted to capitalize that and walked into\nWhat I knew was an employee entrance just trying to see what I could find out and then pretty quickly it was founded by a security guard who escorted me out\nThere you know the times covered this in many different ways that they had a really fascinating timeline they did this video timeline\nA lot of human interest stories and you wrote a really interesting human interest story about two brothers both were on the Las Vegas metropolitan police department how did you get that story and what was that like\nBy the end of the first day the marching orders that I got that we had about half a dozen colleagues or so of mine on the ground and then several other people working sources and working the phones\nIn both New York and Washington DC with federal investigators um but my job pretty early on was to cover the\nMetro police department to understand what the share of was saying to try to make sources locally\n[noise] so I spend a lot of time at headquarters and spend a lot of ten asking questions sort of both ... simultaneously pressing the the officers and in Greece shady myself and I went to the memorial service for the officer who was killed\nWhile attending the concert and somebody mentioned to me that there was another officer who had been on duty and who was shot and was willing to speak with me and then\nSomebody mentioned to me that there was another officer who had been on duty and who was shot and was willing to speak with me and then in the process of speaking with him learn\nThat he also had a twin brother who had been on duty that night and was listening to information come in when he heard that his own brother had been shot and then of course on this incredibly stunning and fascinating and both of them were very willing to talk about it\nOpenly and talk about their fear\nWhich is you know pretty remarkable I think for a police\nOfficer to be willing to do in particularly to be willing to do so quickly athlete after the incident\nI'm Talking to journalists racial holding of the city morning Harold and Jennifer ... with the New York times the stuff of a New York times was a finalist for the ... Pulitzer Prize in breaking news for the coverage of Las Vegas shooting both of them came here immediately in the aftermath of the shooting just about a year ago\nA ritual you've covered crime and Australia and after the shooting here there was sort of a lot of confusion a released by the police department here as to the timeline they kept a re release information than they would corrected what was your reaction to that\nIt it was very difficult to get a sense of what exactly had happened on the side of the timeline the change in bed and and um I I recall there was a security guard who acted thing had arrived on the scene and possibly wash it\nAnd shooting and then that became very unclear whether hate arrived actually end of this reading so it was difficult to pin down they they have but I must say at this rally in general is coming to a couple of days and it was actually one of the last assignment\nThat I had to Colorado on Iraq and the U.S on on this posting about two weeks beforehand I was really surprised at how open the authorities ... I'm In a straddling I've covered a lot of the tragedies and the place of Barry but they they let out very little information they're very closed a very ...\nAnd so I was actually surprised at how transparent the sheriff's department where and when they were\nBarry caused a very ... and so I was actually surprised at how transparent the sheriff's department where and when they realize that they had you know I messed up the timeline they immediately held a scheduled a press conference and put out new information and kind of that I Believe that the information kept changing because\nThe story kept moving and they were receiving you information and trying to get his time on down pat as well um so\nIt was it was challenging but I was quite I was quite impressed by the solid information and the openness from the authorities and that every day they walk a lot of information coming out or whether it was identity the victims or on the status of um the\nDell friend who was a suspect initially and then imagine the days after that she perhaps didn't know what was happening so yeah it was it was very fascinating story but I found that the information sought are we just kept coming really\nEnjoying it from a do you know the New York times similar question to you because a lot of people on line blogs a conspiracy theorists seemed to make a lot of the changing time on and the different information that came out uh what was what were your thoughts on that\nNo one is that if I remember correctly they tried to come out with a timeline almost immediately almost that very night them would have been Monday Night\nAnd I remember being very struck by well you know that that quick for them to do that and it didn't surprise me at all really when they said the very next day oh we had some of our\nInformation and make that point we knew we know something different now than than we knew twenty four hours ago\nWent did surprise me and you could feel this even in the in the Mandalay Bay itself I talked to a bartender who was who\nAdamantly believe that there could not possibly just be one shooter and that the police must be covering something up\nAnd I was stunned at how quickly and and sincerely people really seemed to believe that and how skeptical people were um it is quite unusual Rachel is saying that she was struck by that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Reno", "day": "01"}
