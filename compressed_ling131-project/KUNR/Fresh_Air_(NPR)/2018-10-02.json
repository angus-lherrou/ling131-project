October first two thousand Seventeen social media grape spraying up providing a place for survivors victims their families first responders and staff of the Ninety One harvest festival to connect\nShawna Bartlett was one of the people who were instrumental in creating an administering those sites\nAs well as fundraisers reunions and random acts of kindness Shawna and her fellow survivor pat him eco joined us a few days before the one year mark since October first to talk about those activities Sean and pat welcome thank you for having us\nSean ... you're the vice president of a nonprofit called love wins gummy how that came into being\nTell me how that came into being\nLoved ones was created by a gentleman by the name of dean gene didn't score oh he was the founder um he was actually a photographer ... Ninety One\nAnd after that night he got really involved in it started by doing a toy drive for the kids um of victims of the Ninety One\nAnd it grew from there into a nonprofit where we were actually honoring one of the fifty eight each month and money that came in would go to that family\nUm then we started helping other survivors being able to help with their you know if they had a bill or if they couldn't pay their rent or anything that could help another survivor we were able to kind of raise money it started very small\nIt's grown since then uh this this weekend is the one year and we actually have two events for love wins um it's become a very instrumental place for people for the survivors of hurting anyone\nTo kind of go and you know everyone says how shy glove wins which is what we are and it's it's a really good place for people and to kind of\nUse as a resource um for doing good things for other people and that's the project that called fifty eight random acts of kindness effects it\nFifty at random acts of kindness didn't start with from love wins but it did become instrumental for the survivors everybody has become doing a random act of kindness in honor of the fifty eight I as well did on several people have\nWe made little cards but the pictures of the fifty eight and ... they went all over it was honestly I don't know who actually started the random acts of kindness\nI Know who actually started the random acts of kindness that fifty eight but it became a nationwide thing with us as far as doing something in the honor of one of the ... yes\nI understand too that a pat him eco you were involved in some of those projects do you remember one that lives especially moving for you\nI I Do there was a young lady that was shot and I was trying to find who her name at the time and through friends and businesses in town I went in um made my own T shirts and a little song and all the money that we raised from that eventually\nMonths later I was able to find out who she was and present them with them with a check to do that I also attended events that are Sean was heavily involved in a different ones from\nUm the six months ceremony and the butterfly release and are those events I attended a we've done all we can on our end to raise money for the families\nShawna as pat mentioned you've organized several events for survivors I Want you to tell me a little bit about those\nHow did they come about why did you decide to do them\nAbout three weeks after route Ninety One was the first event that I helped organize with another survivor and the for whatever reason this weekend there were several people coming back to Vegas to attend the crosses\nAnd is Heather attend the healing garden and on that Saturday Night the first event was at ... and we had over a hundred survivors that night\nTony's and we had over a hundred survivors that night it's Tony's and then the next morning was a brunch that I helped organize with another survivor and we had eighty five people the brunch and I realized that every\nTime at these events that people were meeting that helped each other that night for the first time or they were friends that day that we can and they had met up and they were wondering if that person alive and survived\nThere was a lot of people that were looking for each other and I realized at ... at at every single one of these events I could see smiles and I could see hugging\nAnd I could see some sort of relief in each person's eyes and for me I thought\nFor that moment we don't get to think about what he did that night [noise] and for me\nI felt that that was a little bit of human each time for all of the survivors even if it was just a little bit but I knew we all needed some healing from that night and I just kept going and they just kept getting bigger and bigger\nAnd myself and one other survivor Connie long right now are organizing the reunion which happens to obviously this weekend and we have over thirty one hundred survivor's coming to town to attend the summit and\nIt's just the healing process each time we get together each time we met you meet your brother it's in Vegas or in the other states California has several events as well Connie long has helped organize quite a few of those you just you don't want to be with anybody else and helps us understand each other and we feel connected because\nSolids a lot of times people want to ask what can I Do how can I help do you want to talk about it\nAnd our initial reaction just because of the ... I mean the ... that we're on right now especially with the one year and the emotions you there's nothing that they can do other than just give you a hug and you let us know that you're there when we're ready we'll talk when we're ready will cry\nAnd we'll explain but it's it's hard to explain unless you've been there and that you you know first of all you don't wish this upon your worst enemy you know you don't wish upon your family members that they go through something like this it's just hard it's just more understand\nAnd just understanding you can't change it and you can't fix it and understanding that we can explain it\nI think the ... when the groups get together and you get so many people United it's interesting the fact that everybody doesn't necessarily talk about the day we don't actually feel it it's not it's not that way everybody\nIt's not that way everybody that was there already understands yeah they they don't have to necessarily talk about it they are comfortable around the people that they don't even have to root for her to this everybody's emotions are different and some people\nIt affects daily every day of their lives and others it does not it may not have affected me the same as it affected Sean or anybody else but I can tell you that I now understand\nEvery single person involved here regardless of how extreme or how minute their issues are whether they can sleep at night or cap sleep at night I understand\nSo as to as a group together we don't have to discuss the wheel\nAnd tell us about a couple of you talked about the fundraising projects that you to to help families of victims and survivors give us a couple of examples of those projects through\nLove wins um like I said they curse at Christmas Time we had a lot of the victims that were injured\nAsk for help for Christmas Time and so other survivors would adopt them I myself I'm with two other survivors adopted a family\nWho had four kids and the husband or their dad was actually shot that night and almost didn't make it he was actually I'm a lift drivers stopped and they threw the ... the gentleman in the back of the car and he was blue when he entered the car and if it wasn't for that left driver he wouldn't have made it\nAnd they had four kids and we took on the family and we buy all the kids everything on their Christmas last we got we were able to um get each one of the kids a new bike we raised over Fifteen hundred dollars and\nThere was other families who I'm obviously did stuff for the one of the fifty eight or all the fifty eight that needed help or at Christmas Time it just became a big deal for all of us to kind of help each other\nThis may sound strange to say because of the occasion that its marking but\nAre you looking forward to the reunion in a way I'm looking forward to the reunion for a couple of different reasons\nOne I'm I'm looking forward to hugging everybody on that day because\nWe will take back some sense of what was taken from us at night I'm also looking forward to\nBeing able to see people that I have countless emails telling Connie night that this is our first time back and having them be able to take some of their fear away from them and I'm looking further to the reunion because\nIn a picture science at these smaller events you don't realize how big are family has become and I can't wait to see how it's become\nWe've been talking with Sean Bartlett and pet him eco Shawna pat thank you so much for joining us thank you for having\nWe spoke with China and pat about the love wins nonprofit and fifty eight random acts of kindness a few days before the reunion that they organized for survivors to mark one year since the route Ninety One harvest festival shooting you can find links to those

twenty Seventeen Las Vegas is tourism economy faced a dilemma\nHow to advertise the well known glitz in glitter in light of unspeakable tragedy I'm soon after the Las Vegas convention and visitors authority one of the groups responsible for advertising the area to the world started using a slogan the caught on quickly\nAreas of the world started using a slogan that caught on quickly\nVegas strong was on billboards on shop windows on cars and in many instances it's still there a year later ... is the c._e._o. of our and our partners and was part of the team that helps use Vegas strong belief welcome back to the program thank you\nSo it really walk us through those initial days after the shooting at you know the Elvie CVA tours in groups with Las Vegas they have these advice scheduled months in advance did you pretty much knew immediately that the regular what happens here stays your ads needed to go\nI think all advise had to go and interestingly enough we already had pulled advise down but even before one October because of the hurricanes and the southeast and taxes self\nKnows a lot of tragedy going on at the time but of course is one October happened I'm wonderful cooperation from all of our media partners and pulled everything down you know and it wouldn't matter what the campaign was at that point it was inappropriate I mean the first twenty four forty eight hours was\nFact fighting was getting the truth out you know there were so many crazy stories that were going out that night there was a um so they're caught a little bit of fire that there were shootings happening at ... at that down the strip from seizures to the stratosphere et cetera et cetera\nSet first time periods first six eight hours it was mostly communicating with law enforcement and getting out\nYou know a message that were correct and factual and dealing with the you know sort of runaway gossip on social media ...\nYou know sort of runaway gossip on social media [noise] most of our folks at that point to for the entire community was the victims and their families and how to take care of these people that had been hurt and the families that were coming for their loved ones that have been killed\nHow long did it take to come up with the idea of Vegas strong as kind of the over our message that would be used\nWhile to tell you the truth about that which is we didn't actually come up with that we're thinking of what to do you know they had been Boston Strong cetera after the marathon by out in\nUm our visitors got so active on to defend and to support the destination that hashtags Vegas strong was what was trending on social media by the people by our fans by our family by our extended\nFamily and so there was so much content out there are under attack Vegas wrong we would have been done to go to try to you know go against the wave so we said that's it that's where we're going with it\nSo it was it was really everybody else\nThat it was organic yeah completely grew from from the minds and hearts of our of our visitors\nI remember that first added that came out you know for Las Vegas after the shooting black and white ad Andre Agassi you know native son is narrating\nHow was that developed how quickly did that get turned around because it seemed like within a few days here's this you know advertisement of resilience of strength on television\nWas within a couple of days the ... the next evening are cheap creative director and one of our great writers Arnie ...\nShe creative director and one of our great writers Arnie to George and he's a Vegas native and so he was flying back here for ... frantically to get back and was that was pretty upset about it and he was thinking about what to communicate that both\n\nOn earth sort of the the the families and in in in in the horrible things that happen here but at the same time begins to talk about the resiliency of this community and the amazing response not just by the professionals which were\nAll fantastic fire police uh paramedics trauma centers et cetera\nYou saying that we as a community came out of the Vegas strong or or does the tragedy does the slogan do any of those things factor in how Las Vegas markets itself in the future do you think\nFor now I don't think it does because again we very much don't wanna have Las Vegas defined by that you know after nine eleven New York did a fabulous job I'm of\nRick presenting itself as healing as not gonna give in to this not going to allow our community it'd be devastated by this horrific attack and of course it took a lot longer with the with the buildings and everything I'm but eventually in New York became New York again\nRight I mean there's always the memory of nine eleven there's always the compassion\nI mean there's always the memory of nine eleven there's always the compassion and the passion for the victims there is a memorial there it's sadder et cetera\nBut to a lot of people in New York as New York I mean you know and and and they go for business they go there for\nA dining they go there for whatever reasons they go so I think that memory of one I ... is always going to be there it's going to be there in people's hearts but is it isn't going to affect why or why people don't come to Las Vegas\nDo you think Las Vegas has become Las Vegas again\nYeah so I really do I do I think the biggest always transforming this world transforming the communication revolution transformed our our customers generationally will transform so\nVegas is an ever changing a destination or visitors or ever changing a generationally wherever changing so it's not the same but it is what it would have been anyway\nWhat do you think will be the lasting legacy of Vegas strong\nThat it reflected the resilience of a community ... reflected the heart of Las Vegas that simple that simple\n... is the c._e._o. of our and our partners he was part of the team that helped develop the slogan Vegas strong in the aftermath of the one on top of shooting\nThings through time thank you so much anytime there is more conversation ahead this is state of Nevada\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nGood afternoon it's

tense near fifty six at the lake [noise]\n\nRight now in Truckee it's Seventy degrees Reno Seventy five [noise]\n\n\n\nNevada public radio I'm Joe Schwieterman at state of Nevada\nThe pain of the October first shooting will stick with the veterans and victims from around the country for many years to come senseless unexplained horrific people still struggle to even describe or confront what happened\nBut one thing did help people get through it at least in about the Vegas Golden knights the nights are the\nIn the ... the Vegas Golden knights the nights are the first major league sports team to call Las Vegas home and in their first season they went to the championship finals maybe more than that they gave Las Vegas something to cheer about Dan ... is the radio voice of the Golden Knights Dan welcome back Hi Joe\nIt's great to be here [noise] the Golden Knights first regular season game in Las Vegas October tenth nine days after the shooting leading up to that game behind the scenes what was the talk like about how the team was going to honor the\nShooting victims so much of what happened in the days leading up to October tenth was revamping what had been explicitly detailed plans to launch major league sports in Las Vegas\nAnd the organization had two things to do one was getting ready for hockey games the team was playing on the road in Dallas in Arizona before that October tenth game and I can't imagine what it would have been like if the first home game was just a few days earlier I think they would have postponed it I really do\nA lot of things were postponed or even canceled fans fast celebration activities in the days leading up to the first regular season games and so instead of those preparations going forward\nThe gears shifted to where can we go how can we help the players to staff the front office folks and a lot of it was covered\nA lot of it was it uncovered where the players were who they were with relationships that were forged and it might be divine intervention I've thought a lot about it\nHow it the right time the players arrived here and what they do\nThe right time the players arrived here and what they did for people and I get choked up just thinking about it hadn't gone to examine our lawyers they can't see you but you know actually getting teary I yeah I Know some of the players who are brand new to this town\nThey were thrust into the situation of course nobody asked for this but what I have seen in a career of broadcasting sports is\nHow athletes are so\nSo much part of a community wherever they play they feel it in themselves giving back as part of what they do because we have so many of us who played youth sports whether it's little league or you've hockey whatever it might be and\nYou're part of a community and somebody coaches you somebody helps you you look up to somebody\nAnd so that's in you as an athlete and I think that when you become a professional athlete especially in major league athlete and then on top of it the first major league athletes and the city of over two million people\nThere's a special responsibility there but because I think hockey players in particular really hold is to be true community is what makes a hockey player\nYou have to have the support for the rights to practice the money to buy equipment so these players know what it means to be supported by others and so they can give it back there in that position and I think that ah\nYou know how that all happened the timing of it just is remarkable to think back now a year later\nAnd it meant a lot to to me to see that relationship bro having not know much about Las Vegas myself that this was a place\nLas Vegas myself that this was a place that had a community and the Golden Knights I think brought back to the forefront [noise] ... do you remember that night and I told her ... what did feel like\n[noise] it's\nOne of those nights where the details are so vivid I can sit here for an hour and and describe all the things that happened\nThe ceremony that was supposed to take place before the shooting was all about celebrating the birth of major league sports in Las Vegas here's the NHL or here's the show here's what's going to happen with the Vegas Golden knights and introducing the team to the fence\nAnd all that changed the folks in the production department the business office and Johnny Greco who leads the entertainment department at the Golden Knights they had to scrap a pregame ceremony that was months and months in the making and I was curious to see how they could possibly put something together in the span of days\nTo capture the moment so that it would be a balance of celebration for the night that it was supposed to be alert launch of major league sports here\nWhile at the same time not dismissing in any way the tragedy that had happened just days earlier and the balance they struck\nWas perfect it so far exceeded expectations and I'll tell you how far exceeded expectations more so\nThan the success of the team on the ice\nBats how much it impressed me what they did the video tribute um the the people on the ice the first responders the survivors and ...\nPeople on the ice the first responders the survivors and it was topped off with Derrick Anglin's address to the crowd and Derek is the oldest gold at night he's thirty six years old he is not the captain by name but he is the captain by default\nHe played for the Las Vegas wrangler is an easy AHL two thousand three four and five and he's lived here ever since in the off season he met his wife here his kids were born here he's kind of an ambassador for hockey in this town prior to the Golden Knights and that he is part of the team is as a leader in a player\nIs extraordinary and so that he got up there and I interviewed him earlier that morning and he didn't let on that he was going to be addressing the crowd", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Reno", "day": "02"}
