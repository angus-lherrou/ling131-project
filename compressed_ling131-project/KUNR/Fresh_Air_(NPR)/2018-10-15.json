seller her new book everything's trashed but it's OK is a series of funny conversational personal essays on subjects including being a feminist nearly getting a victim when she was going broke trying to make it as a comic\nGoing from a four year relationship to being single again and then being in a relationship again and what it's been like as a black woman to be an interracial relationship\nPhoebe Robbins in welcome to fresh air and it's a pleasure to have you on our show so you started in comedy about eight years ago ten years after near OK okay what was the gender race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lot of straight white guys some women and some people color a few queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um [noise]\nThat can be exhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there's just so way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their manned parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of you know\nAnd things like ... and a lot of you know men in the audience\n[noise] yeah I mean I think it just I just want to be clear that when anyone starts doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really sort of posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I've finally gotten to a place where I can occurs is I I don't\nHave to believe it's so so why bother\nI don't want to do that yet I don't want to I don't want to do it I'm not alone Wayne okay I'm not going to [laughter]\n\nUm so I just really got to a place you know I think honestly the place I got to happened when I went on tour last fall with a lot of ... we did our why why tour across America and we were both kind of being like\nOh we're funny we've been doubting ourselves as whole freaking time at a law that has been informed by the fact that we\nHave different energy that a lot of the male comics we care yourselves different maybe tell a joke in a different way or different style and we were beating ourselves up in allowing that sort of\nThink it's hard to like um imagine what it's like to not have that and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a ... queens that would have been a game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like hey\nBlack woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like hey young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to like young black women talking about\nOh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair like totally like messed it up\nI couldn't talk about by black hair woes and high school with like Laura she doesn't know she doesn't she just wakes up and she has to be flawless like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK\nWith being out numbered in a way and not letting that make me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or\nYou know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows where you can still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like queen ... and be like oh okay cool so I could kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman [noise] you're right\nAbout body image in your book and you say yeah since you were fourteen your brain has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning not attractive to straight to the end for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so how have you tried to overcome that because it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place\nThe standards ... is at a different place than you are just kind of visceral like I gain too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer was no other an analogies great moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still makes that self dot com and so I think what I\nHave done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising but not like I don't have a skill in a house and make it is not about a number if you're just going like I Need to make sure I'm strong enough to get through the day rather than\nI I Want to make sure I look in these pair of jeans and a few more powerful the little bit of experiences that have gotten with like styling and doing like these photo shoots and again these are champagne problems I just went up ...

I'm so sorry my they knew what size I was four weeks before I showed up I is not my fault I'm decides that I Know\nThere's an afterword an addendum to your book in part of your book is about being

terrible British accent all the time for him and he he loves it but not at all [laughter] so you are single\nFor at least two years in between ... and ... the person who you're with no what have you learned about yourself from the periods where you you were single and lived alone\nBefore I met British bake off that's what we call him a before I met him I really\nSort of define me or make me realize that I'm lovable\nI just had to sort of figure that out for myself and be OK\nIf I don't date someone for two years or two and a half years or five years and if I haven't like found my soul mate or my partner by the end of that mean that I'm a terrible person you know what I mean it's like all these like value systems you like placed on yourself\nAnd it was all predicated on what someone else thought about me never once they check in and see how I felt about myself\nDid you have to learn how to a fully enjoy yourself when you were not with somebody whether it's going to a movie by herself or having dinner by herself [noise] um I just feel like I'm consuming this I'm watching this and I don't need somebody with me to fully appreciate the experience\nAbsolutely I mean I I did all that stuff where I just and you always think like you go out to like a diner or a movie go by yourself and you think everyone is just like dropping the ... restaurant everyone's dropping therefore they're going there is a woman thing by herself\nAnd they're all like focused on their ... they are not thinking about you you know and it was just was so sort of like self absorbed Rome like everyone's judge me for being single and yes there are certain people and everyone's lives who will like judge them for being single but it was just kind of like\nWho cares big world am I not going to

of romantic era travelogue and scientific exploration\nIn Washington Black ... has created a wonder of an adventure story powered by the helium a fantasy but also by the tender sensibility of its aspiring young hero wash black\nLet's backtrack a second to that opening scene at the plantation the new master is not the only white men who steps down from that carriage his younger brother Christopher wild nicknamed pitch also all lights\nChristopher wild nicknamed pitch also all lights he turns out to be a rather decent man of science who's brought along the materials to assemble what he calls a cloud cutter a hot air balloon attached to a boat like gone to law\nPitch in lifts wash as his assistant teaching him to read and in the process discovering that washed possesses a skill for executing detailed scientific drawings\nAcross the color line the to strike up a kind of friendship\nSo much so that when it seems likely that wash will be killed in wrongful retaliation for the death of a white visitor to the plantation pitch fires up the gas canister cuts the ropes that tether the cloud cover ... earth and\nTogether the to ascend into attempt pest you as nighttime sky\nI began to cry recalls wash thinking of this extraordinary moment\nThe air group colder crept in webs across my skin all was shadow red light storm fire and frenzy and up we went into the eye of it

elite and their balloon comes crashing down too hard historical realities\nA multitude of plot twists in Sioux taking first washing pitch and then wash alone to the Arctic Nova Scotia\nAnd then wash alone to the Arctic Nova Scotia London and even to the bottom of the sea\nCertainly much of the pleasure of reading Washington Black derives from ... ingenious storytelling gifts but her novel is more than just a boy and bobble\nWashes weighted down throughout his travels by the burden some question of identity for one thing he can never predict how other characters whether they be black or white will see him\nThe prize scientific education he received from pitch elevates wash but also makes him a curiosity much like the solitary little orange octopus he captures on his underwater dive to leader exhibits\nWash resolutely places his faith in science to advance human enlightenment but midway through the novel he experiences a harsh awakening\nI had long seen science as the great equalizer watch says no matter one's race or sex or faith there were facts in the world waiting to be discovered how little thought I'd give in to the ways in which it might be corrupted by human beings\nWashington Black is an unconventional and often touching novel about the search for transcendence above categories as she tries to do for her hero watch and see huge and clearly aims to carry

producer Sam brother\n... welcome to fresh air\n[noise] Hi I'm really pleased to be here\nUm the plantation of your novels in Barbados I gather you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\nYou know I'm not I'm not a ... a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers a\nYou know everywhere expendable so the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher\nThe are the conditions and circumstances of slaves lives were much more dire and I'm ... you know quite horrific to have to to do that research but some very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a is George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash and he's a field work around those plantation but one day he gets a call to go serve the demand house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect but the masters\nThe main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild it goes by ... there's a lot of nicknames and uh he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested washed be his assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight he's as for ... for the balloon\nUm and it's a moment the changes wash his life forever because a bond forms between him and this was white men pitch\n'em and teach will eventually help wash a scape but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change in this and this boy's life and not arbitrariness forever Hans wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as being helpful to his experiment and that he is you know precisely the right weight a\nDemand his arrows stats are which is you know kind of a cruelty in itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington really um surprises him with his natural gets sick he has no\nNo idea you know that this is the young men is just completely you just don't naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a good sense for 'em or nautical methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under pitch\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore a ... character is you know although he's an extremely liberal minded men for his time or you know there are limits to his to his thinking\nAh you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is and a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions a\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very general belief in the rights of men it's kind of a prescribed believe but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nAnd his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get to heaven if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this has been central to his\nA philosophy or about life but you know having said that he somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to the great affection for Washington and so there's that dichotomy in his personality that's so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash a scrapes from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives on him you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how for your the people complicit in ... the slave economy\n[noise] yeah exactly I think that son teach for instance\nLikes to believe that because he has these in light and ideas that he is and because he's actually trying to do something to end slavery itself you know I think he has a sense of themselves as being quite a moral person and\nThen he goes into the world's with that feeling about\nAnd then he goes into the world's with that feeling about himself and feeling quite good about his place", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "15"}
