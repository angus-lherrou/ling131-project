words\nKatrina calling from Williamsburg, Virginia Hi Katrina welcome\nHave a way with words where they say is Katrina calling from Williamsburg, Virginia\nKatrina welcome what can we do for you\nI Am calling to find out if you are saying that fed to describe something that was previously spoken about its proper for instance if I told you I was like at a farmer's market to buy vegetables I could send you a picture of the vegetables with the caption fad vegetables so\nThat makes sense yeah mhm said ... you said on his way to refer to like you said something that was spoken about in the past is this a construction that you're likely to use\nWell I'm kinda new to social media and I see it everywhere like my sister post stuff are often stopped or heard about things that we\nYou know pictures or something that we've spoken about before and she'll say that about ... but I don't want to do it and sound crazy so I was just calling to find out can I use it or is it just something that like occurring right now\nWell it's certainly a legitimate usage as the usage of said to me ... the aforementioned thing or the uh for said the thing goes back about seven hundred years in English loud and really really really old I'm not really aware of it being used um\nUh in terms of of something casual like that so\nYeah it's usually more formally definitely will see legal documents particularly when there's a\nDiscourse or discussion where somebody was mentioned in a previous part of the doctor the legal document mhm the other part of it is I could see somebody doing it ironically and certainly the Internet or bones and people doing things ironically they wouldn't otherwise to\nRight yeah that was my sense of it I mean are are you trying to be funny when you do it or you\nDon't know it's kind of just like a way to describe like instead of saying these are the vegetables I told you about earlier you could just say\nScribes like instead of saying it or the vegetables I told you about earlier you could just say that basketball so I didn't know if my property is it that way\nI like it it sounds ironic yeah it sounds like there is a tone mismatch is what it is and that's a a little bit of comedy that we often turned to language where in an informal situation we use formal speech and we all kind of get a little I don't know a hormone jolt or something because we've added to the match it it makes sense but the match isn't\nYou're listening to the way with words they show that language and how we use it I might the by net and I'm grandparent and we're joined by John Jeanette ... guy John\nHi grant Hi Martha yellow high you know I'm In Alice in wonderland Lewis Carroll introduced this or rather weird unanswerable question that's a classic rental housing or even like a writing desk\nNow do either of you know in an answer to that if you've heard it's would prefer before I'm sure All right but I Do no good answer except I'm ones like the other only done one of their basic English words the both English words simulate one said poll wrote on both\nOver a Carol and Carol himself said both can produce a few notes though there are very flat\nYeah so but in any case there it was meant to be a sort of a nonsense question in any case I have another question for you\nHow was a popular song like a butterfly net\nIt's catchy yes it's actually very good\nSo the following question to follow the same pattern one thing's describe bubble by an adjective that ends and why the other can be too but in a different way\nOkay All right I think you've got it you know they're both catch e now this one's kind of classic how was scotch tape like a walking cane they're both ... they're both sticky yes how was the four seasons hotel\nKatie they're both sticky yes how was the four seasons hotel like a grade school teacher\n... last year it was very good I was an old fashioned car like a mean old man\nOf cranky\n[laughter] I'm so glad you guys getting right into the

F. I. X.\nE. S. dot org ... Michael ... Michael I'm going in and the u._k. sort of together his work is\nYeah and in the u._k. together his work is fantastic and explains each of these pre fixes and suffered says so forth in in detail and talks about where they come from why we use them and some words that have them\nI think what I'm hearing my evening I don't\nYou're weekend right [laughter]\nI can hear your voice [laughter] All right I think as you are always style or not for me [laughter] get some sleep now [laughter] you\nOkay so by you know I'm looking the Oxford English dictionary mano cycle is a word that are yeah it was rare back to Eighteen sixty nine at least you know same thing in a cycle\n[laughter] just wins sometimes where there's right for a single item or yeah add a gory one prevails and it becomes the ...\nTerm right [laughter] English words arm wrestling eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three [noise]\nWord you're probably going to be hearing more and more of in the coming years is solace ... oh I've heard this yeah sure I remember what it meant though I thought in your double time dictionary on our Web site what does it mean\nStyle G. S. O. L. A. S. T. A. L. G. I. N. E. refers to a form of psychic or existential distressed that's caused by environmental change or a change to uplift\nIt'll change or a change to a place that you know well and have taken comfort and it was coined by Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht in two thousand three is is like ... but it also combines the words solace and desolate\nAnd the idea is that um say your your town was destroyed by wildfire or um or your your home in Appalachia was destroyed by a strip mining mhm or you you see an environmental situation that's getting worse and worse and maybe the Arctic\nMelting or something like that ...\nIs the term that more and more people in the field of a philosophy and the psychology or using\nSo it's the loss of something that you want sought solace and yes exactly and so the the feeling that you get on these things start to disappear\nYeah particularly in your environment and I guess it could be like um you know you go back to your own neighborhood and the buildings are gone\nRight now right what's an empty lot better now and other Starbucks yeah sell us down to eight seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three oh you have a way with words\nHello this is Monica I'm calling from Tallahassee, Florida I monitor will come to the show and I had to be here [laughter] I'm so recently I was reading bedtime\nStories for my kids and you\nKnow we check out a lot of books from the library and I I make an effort to check out books that represent a lot of different cultures 'cause I Want to expose them to a lot of different kinds of people and um you know I I was reading this book called fluffy and Fox [noise]\nI'm thinking about how does one read in dialect that does not your own dialect [noise] um [noise]\nSaturday and Sunday November fourth [noise]\nAt pioneer center to get a bill\nYou're listening to a way with words the show about language and how we use it I'm grandparents in March the Barnett\nBorn in London in Seventeen Seventy two Luke Howard was a shy chemist who was also really fascinated by weather and particularly by clouds he wants to organize how we understand and observed as ever changing formations up in this tiny wanted to do it in a way that was scientific\nAnd Eighteen oh three he's self published a pamphlet that he called on the modifications of clouds et cetera in it he proposed the classification system for clouds and he drew on his school boy Latin\nFor clouds in he drew on his school boy Latin and came up with the main categories which were serious strata and cumulus now serious comes from the Latin for hair or temporal strategist comes from the Latin for layer and cumulus is like a pile you know like accumulate\nAnd this new way of looking at clouds in these new names in this whole new language for talking about something that everybody had always seen but never really classify that way it hit a nerve in the popular imagination and look Howard became this reluctant scientific celebrity\nIs not quite sure was championed by some of the greatest minds of his time especially the influential German poet gr to gr to win so far as to write poems based on those names\nAnd some people criticized Howard for using Latin rather than everyday spoken English and gr to wrote a passionate response or on Howard's behalf\nAnd he argued that those Latin cloud name should be accepted in all languages they should not be translated because in that way the first intention of the inventor and founder of them is destroyed and he even went on to send Howard gushing fan mail which is kind of hard to imagine today\nThe story of all of this is told by historian Richard hamblin in the book the invention of clouds how an amateur meteorologist\nForged the language of the skies and in fact if you go to his home in London there's a historical marker that says Luke Howard name or of clouds lived and died here are all of them may not have clouds little we all remember when we come up with a word we won the claim recognition\nRemember when we come up with a word we won the claim recognition that knowledge right going to be part of history right and he got that ... is your fan yeah I Know I met any of my ... eyes with heart the letters to Howard [laughter]\nYeah forget the house [laughter] I\nNever knew that story I just I just thought some scientists came up with yeah these names but we still use them today yeah absolutely\nAnd they're not intact and other languages right they are modified to fit the different languages that they\n... actually I don't know that there is a pretty clear system of classification of clouds and I don't know it's always I like how it\nPlugs into in the development of meteorology as a as a science where we started to realize that some of those old solves about the red sky or when I had a little bit of truth and we could look at the sky to see what was going to happen a little later with\nOur weather exactly trace this guy with a painters fresh the wins around using little rushed talking about serious clown yeah\nAnd what I also love about this is that\nIt was a way of using language to impose order on something that didn't seem to have any order it seems that Luke Howard was was someone who who saw differences in clouds and saw patterns and indeed um began meteorology that way\nOften thought that if there were another species on this planet had the same kind of active intelligence as humans that they might actually call us a word that means the class of fires\nBecause that is so much of what humans do we sort organized we classify and if you were to think about our primary behavior a lot of it has to do with all the things that we say things that we ...\nA lot of it has to do is that the things that we say the things that we produce how we organize ourselves in our community so it's about setting these boundaries and think this is a box and all those things of this type go in that box I\nHate to classify as you say really likes and then of course the language is key to that rain ... making sense of the world we love language and if you come across the patches the talks about language in a way that you really enjoy we want to know and we want to share it with our other listeners centered along\nEmails words at ... dot org and you can link to it on Twitter ... W. A. Y. W O R D hello you have a way with words hello how are you doing great how are you and who is this\nThis is rod grey I'm from Dallas texas I ride one show I ride my family has some cute little things but my favorite\nAnd I'm from California a born and raised in Arkansas and she's the safest thing every time something was like weird or not right or whatever or like an accident on the road or or like a ... of tree limbs fall off of the tree or whether she said don't that just ...\nAnd I've always wondered were or if that came from because she died I never got to ask her where um she got started with it but I've heard it all my life\nUh-huh what other kinds of car accident or or someone would pull out in front of my uncle she never drove\nBecause I'm ... back into the garage wall and got out of the car and says I'll never dropped again don't that just ...\nSo it's just the way she always threw it into a ... something just wasn't quite right okay yeah\nI got a lot of cousins that I got a lot of aunts and uncles but none of 'em ever knew where she got it from her she made it up or what but it sounds like something somebody would you shouldn't I don't that just ... you know why not happen you know or something\nDon't that just ... you know why not happen you know or something\nMhm yeah and indeed that's the case it seems to go back to perhaps college slang in the U.S from from the late uh nineteenth century\nOr not the full phrase just the verb to frost right one read that full phrase of the moon doesn't that just X You it's kind of a template for a whole bunch of other verbs it'll fill in the ... that that\nYeah that that ...

Shelley the poet all these people were inspired by this whole idea of classifying a clouds and Percy ... Shelley wrote a poem called the cloud and it's long so I'm not going to read the whole thing but I'm getting read the first ah stanza which will give you a taste of it\nI bring fresh showers for the third ... flowers\nFrom the seas and streams I barely light shade for the leaves when late and their new day dreams\nFrom my wings are shaking the abuse that wake in the sweet buds everyone when rocked to rest on their mothers breast and she dances about the sun\nI we owns the ... of the lashing hail and white and the green planes under and then again I dissolve it didn't rain and laugh as I pass in thunder\nAnd it's so beautiful and rhythmic and so much imagery and and should be a poem that's taught when you're talking about personification in English class it's really a lovely upon that goes on and on and that's prejudice Shelley and the ... at the clouds the clouds\nAnd that's pretty sheepishly and oppose colds and the clouds the clouds thinks Martha those beautiful colas eight seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three\nHigh you heavily ... words by\nThis is Mike Mike from Green Bay welcome to the show what can we do for yeah\nI was just talking to a few days ago with my dad you're talking about kind of some drinking colloquial as long as that we've both grown up with 'em throughout the generations in one that we found that we both knew was\n... and it's a term that we both known in our front groups for a unfinished fear is that you find that at a party you pick a can of that it's only half full and you say well who left the ... year why aren't you finish your beers a\nShia traced it back to his ah college friend whose last name was grad key and ... he was telling me you know that's all over the country and that you know he's been to California in Nashville um he's down in Florida and he's hurt people using this term that was started in La Crosse Wisconsin", "year": "2018", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "city": "Reno", "day": "28"}
