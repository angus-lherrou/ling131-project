Ohio which is about fifty miles outside of Cleveland she wrote to us\nI was very quiet girl shy and slightly backward but I was smart and in what was then called advanced classes\nMy dad was in the military and we moved around a lot so I was really quiet and shy for that reason our home and family was Mississippi\nShe goes on to talk about how one day early in the school year her English teacher asked her a question and during the answered yes ma'am her teacher was indignant and said you do not said ma'am to me it is disrespectful do you understand\nEnter into automatically responded yes ma'am [laughter] and she goes on to say\nYes ma'am [laughter] and she goes on to say remember I'm from Mississippi and in that day not seeing that could get you a wooden spoon to the back side we were born saying it before we said mama and daddy\nBut the teachers saw it as smart alec in in her defense sometimes kids would say yes ma'am or something like that sarcastically\nAnyway her teacher ended up sending to rent it to the principal's office\nAnd she goes on I had never been there before I was embarrassed ashamed and mortified what had I done my first year and I'm In trouble two weeks into being there\nThe principal read the note listen to me talk and proceeded to tell me here in northeastern Ohio we speak standard English we do not slur our\nWe do not stretch out our words we did not say certain things they are not correct\nI was sent home with a note from him to have my parents sign it and come have a talk he made arrangements for me to have speech therapy I was mortified\nFortunately though she writes my parents fell out laughing I never did do therapy I graduated with high honors from that school system after changing schools two more times in the four years I didn't think it funny at the time but I can look back over fifty years later and laugh\nI knew you would be not a no functioning not I have not an urgent requires them requires I was gonna say the same thing I Am not to the funny stage yet there\nI Am not to the funny stage yet there [laughter] I Want to go to the marching on her behalf the rainy called me for her because she said yes man right or and she speaks with the Mississippi accent yeah ... or heart oh I'm sure she's not the only person with a storyline\nOcean we get emails and calls about that yeah I\nGrew up speaking French in Maine and we're told the English speaking schools that they couldn't speak to people who had their hands smacked for speaking Spanish at the religious school them because that's what they spoke at home but not at school yeah I just finished reading about code talkers the Navajo and\nUm they were forced to go to the English speaking schools where they were spanked if they spoke Navajo to hoping\nAttitudes are changing yeah during the thanks for sharing that story\nYeah just to underline a dialect isn't a thing to be corrected it's a thing to be cherished will said eight seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three email\nWords wavered radio dot org hello you have a way with words\nHi this is that ... I'm from Idaho and damn I had a question about the Basque language okay um I have a brother in law who bask in there I I had been kinda drug into the whole Basque culture around Idaho in Idaho has a very large ask\nCommunity mhm and so um I find it pretty fascinating that language is\nI'm considered quite ancient uh is not related to any of the countries around I'm ah in Spain and France So\nI Wonder what your cake was on it\nThat's the best nutshell description I've heard of bask in a while [laughter] much it it's what's known as a language ice\nAnd I've heard of bask in a while [laughter] pretty much it it's what's known as a language isolates do you notice expression\nYes I I look at yeah gotcha\nSo language ice lose one that does not connected directly to the languages around it and it is believed that bask predates\nThe Indo European languages that is that was a language spoken before the people who brought all the Indo European languages into Europe before they arrived and or a little bit about its history because there are few ah inscriptions on gravesites um a lot of the place names give us clues to it\nBut the strong evidence is that it is not directly connected to any of the romance languages although it didn't borrow from Latin it's not connected to any of the Germanic languages other than maybe few words that have traveled from the genetic languages into French and then in tobacco and things like that and so it's it's it's a very interesting thing it is about\nSouthern by about seven hundred thousand people give or take although almost all the speakers bilingual and there are numerous dialects of it I think there are four major dialects of Basque\nAnd uh it's just a very interesting curiosity this remnants of another time and I'm not much is known about it and where it comes from other words it's heavily studied because it's so interesting then and so unconnected to the languages around it\nClung to shelter at all I heard that the people were somehow click with the ... lady there well sure you know I Wish\nAre some people who've tried to propose that theory but it doesn't withstand scrutiny\nSome people have looked at genetic similarities between certain bodies of people um and things I found something they would again generally it falls apart there are superficial similarities between all languages in the world\nFalls apart there are superficial similarities between all languages in the world and what you need is a consistent similarity across multiple\nFeatures of the language for example where you would expect the verbs if one verb is similar between languages we expect many of the verbs to be similar between languages if there's one word for say a relationship term like ... father or mother rooted expect many other relationship terms to be the same and it's just not the case so\nI Believe the evidence is because there is no connection to well there is no connection to the Celtic languages um it's not related to corn issue it's not related to the other languages spoken in France that aren't French and and so forth\nOut yeah it is a very interesting very interesting late for him and the people themselves I think they're very interesting what they are or and what isn't there a time when I'm On the hill ever was ruling when Spain had our people from speaking back\nYeah that's a really common story across cultures it's not just the Spain but even in France some of their regional languages were stumped out by this French need for to establish a nation state with a French identity that was built upon the language and centered upon French just a common language so dialing spoken and Brittany are all but gone\nUm it's unfortunate but I'm having the United states as well in Canada and Australia and the China it just happens pretty much anywhere where nations he's it's identities being firmly attached to one language they almost always put in a program of stopping out the other languages\nFast food is really good and you have your relatives treated you to any\nOh yes they they have my sister has become quite the ask cooks really Boise has what they call at ... o'clock and they have a cultural ... but there are many bars and restaurants\nWhat they call a vast lock and they have a cultural issue but there are many bars and restaurants in the Boise area that are preserving the heritage foods
