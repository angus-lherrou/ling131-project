seven three email words that we would radio dot org hello you're on the way with words\nAt my name is ... and I'm from Indianapolis, Indiana\nWelcome to the show how can we help you\nThe phrase that my grandmother used to use a she grew up in North Carolina and she would say crazy as a Betsy bug\nCrazy isn't bad see bugs [laughter] and how crazy that\nThing because it was never like if someone made her laugh she wouldn't say oh you know some people say oh you're so crazy or something like that she would never use it in that way it was if somebody was doing something that she thought was stupid\nOh man she was saying that part of it as crazy as a busy bugs [laughter]\n\nAnd I I haven't heard it much um I spent some time and when I was a child in North Carolina I heard it there but as far as north I've not heard even from people who've come from the same region\nUh-huh and have you heard the term ... get all\nNow and I have no idea I Know I should I should look that up more but I have no idea what a Pepsi [laughter]\nWell we can tell what a bad seed bug is it's um it's a kind of beetle it also goes by the name patent leather beetle which kind of gives you an idea it's it's kinda bad as big as your thumb and and black and shiny sometimes called the horned beetle\nBut it's also called abet sea bug or best bug or a messy bug\nAnd um you see the phrase crazy is Betsy bug or\nThe phrase crazy is Betsy bug or different variations of that uh throughout the south and nobody really knows why a ... might be considered crazy except it does make an interesting sand is kind of like a you know when you disturb it it makes it kind of\nReally like a little like I had when you when it gets annoyed with you\nKnow like\nThat kind of a you know kind of a ... you know they're pretty sizable and I'm In the beautiful black patent leather looking thing\nI guess that's why it's crazy because other bugs don't talk to you [laughter]\nYeah you don't really see them swarming I'd only seen them you know just wandering around kinda [laughter] well maybe maybe you're right I read a sting [laughter]\nSo that's where there were there for a ... and that's why I wanted that that's why I said it wasn't when she knew there was quite the opposite when she was just wonderful\nI say I'm going to be I was really bloody recall ... spoke with us today thank you so much I'm so happy lives spoken with both of you okay we're going to work and I keep listening as well thanks who I thought I was only hello you have a way with words\nHello this is Joe from Wilson, Wyoming\nJoe said welcome to the show how can we help you\nI have a question about from par or under par when it's used as a Gulf term on her part or as a desirable thing\nFor states that you want to find yourself in that in almost every other endeavor that I can think of being under par or is not something you want to find yourself being\nRight right right All right\nYou want to find yourself being [laughter] right right right All right so we can explain this there are two different scales here two different measuring scales\nAnd so what you need to remember is that each\nSport has its own way of considering something a really great score are really good score for example if you got to sixty nine in golf that's usually pretty good if you got a sixteen in basketball people that are not a very good game you get a sixty nine of baseball people were like forget\nYour [laughter] to having to learn city rather [laughter] to go to a store [laughter] All right\nSo we're talking about different measuring the scales for each part of life not just sports and golf has to really interesting thing where they start with an agreed upon number said say sixty nine and you go a little bit above are a little bit below but that number is considered standard are par the number that up professional\nProbably could reach on this course ... given sufficient time and expertise and and some experience on that course so so golf is a scale that's low to high and some with low being better and so many other things most of the rest of the things in life\nAre the scale is high to low was hiding better and so it's just that court so we're still talking about part of being standard average or this\nThis police that we're going to compare ourselves against it just it it's golf you need a low score and everything else almost you need a high score oh that's interesting the sub par that we use in everyday life actually doesn't come from golf it's just golf borrowed its power from regular English and the regular ... to standard usage of par\nWe're ... the number that you're going to try to beat and go above them so it's a path\nJoseph thank you for your call we really appreciate it\nThank you Bye bye already have a language has its ... butts\nBut I already have a\nLanguage has its core sports oh it's just an extra thing worse\nSeems to go one more beyond ordinary in making a language its own for each individual sport right and adding to our language and then and then it's like when your back yard yeah turn it the feedback loop continues to back into the mainstream language\nWe should say that part comes from the Latin for equal and I thought you know you're on a par with somebody you're equal with him ... eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\n\nSmith from rancho pallas Verde California wrote to us with a family word uh her daughter pips you enjoy jazz recordings she especially loved the singer elephant Gerald\nProud sponsor of all things Reno\nEspecially tell you when our\nYou're listening to way with words the show about language and how we use it I'm grant beret and Martha Burnett\nThe last time you really listen to silence I've been thinking about that ever since reading a passage from a book by Paul Goodman called speaking in language here's what he has to say about silence\nNot speaking in speaking are both human ways of being in the world and there are kinds in grades the beach\nThere's the dumb silence of slumber or apathy this sober silence that goes with the solemn animals face the fragile silence of awareness past hearing the soul went to merge new thoughts the active silence of alert perception ready to say this this\nThe musical silence that accompanies absorbed activity\nThe silence of listening to another speak catching the drift in helping him be clear\nThe noisy silence of resentment and self recrimination loud and sub vocal speech but cell and to say it\nBaffled silence\nThe silence of peaceful accord with other person's or communion\nPeaceful accord with other person's or communion with the cosmos and I was struck by that passage I just keep thinking about it because it really lays out lots of different kinds of silence mhm and when do we ever get to hear silence to begin with\nTrue silence not less noise right in the silent right I don't think we do\nOne of the things that I have read about in the last couple of years is the parts of speech that our silence\nWhere we think of language is being but talking part of the language is also the part where we stopped talking it's also the part where we leave a space for ourselves or for others to pick up the thread or to continue the conversation that silence is just as important as the assurances\nMhm yeah when I Do improv it's you know one has a compulsion to keep talking but sometimes the most powerful moments are when you're completely quiet\nThat compulsion to keep talking is deal cop and journalists tricked right where you sit quiet for just a minute [laughter] hurt or the interviewee is going to feel like they have to fill it\nIn the rain and things that they shouldn't have said right the term for that in art is horror vacuum yeah I've a fear of of the vacuum you don't have\nTo say that I appreciate Simon so I'm a guy who wears earplugs when I work and when I sleep I like quite a lot I mean a lot of ... but I'm also a guy who on his podcast player app\nSets it to take the violence was guess split it can fit more and somebody listening [laughter] you actually speed up the ... I don't anymore I used to do that because uh it's you have to give it a hundred percent of your attention when it's really fun\nBecause uh it's you have to give it a hundred percent of your attention when it's a really fast right there I used to but now it's not a sign of which helps quite a bit you can take\nFor every ten hours I listen I can take out about an hour of science depending on the podcast will you take out an automatic playing as quickly it automatically removed the silence and people pause or there's a break between segments or that sort of thing\nOh man I guess it depends on the topic what podcast you're listening\nThoughtful podcast become friends can mimic unfortunately So Paul Goodman silence and his book speaking of language fats assignments that I really want those are the moments that I really appreciate how\nRear they are have is going to say even in a church which we think of as being assignment place there's still some of the air conditioning and the cars outside and the kids in Bible study right or even at a funeral or someplace like that there's music playing in the hallway and quite whispered conversations there's no real silence\nMhm yeah I guess that's what meditation is all about to write is leading to stop the flow through your mind\nWe'd love your thoughts on science is a part of communication and language he seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three emails words it we were radio dot\nOrg hello you have a way with words Hi Hi this is a will calling from Lexington\nKentucky and I had a question about I'm washing machines and dishwashers\nYeah sure we'll get the repair guys out and we'll get that sorted\n[laughter] ah actually is a bit of a more of an nomenclature question so before we moved into the the new house that we have here we did not have one of the automatic dish washing machine we were just doing things by hand\nSo I was calling it the washing machine for a while a week apparently is reserved for the call was washing machine\nSo I was just curious are two things one why does the clothes washing machine ... the official\nMachine so I was just curious are two things one why does the clothes washing machine get the official moniker of washing machine whereas the dishwasher has this specific to it and why can't you call the washing machine the clothes washing machine\n[laughter] right because it's\nIt's usually uses a washer the washing machine and very rarely do you throw in the word closer laundry when you're talking about the device I think we can sort some of the south for you All right\nMore importantly to settle a bit of a disagreeing I may have had with my uh girlfriend here is it appropriate to call the clothes washing machine or is that\nNot allowed oh [laughter] are you both from Kentucky\nI Know we're both from Ohio originally we've been in Kentucky about two months now so we haven't quite picked up the way they speak here but we both move around quite a bit a guy that some time in Los Angeles she spent some time in Japan of all places\nOh let's let's set that second part aside for now more than I Do like to interfere with marriages as much as we can [laughter] for sure what kind of a linguistics at first the first thing you've got to understand\nIs that the machine\nThe dish washing machine replaced people who are already known as dishwashers so we called the ... just washing machine the dishwasher because the people who used to the job are also known as dishwashers there's a clear like very long separation between the people dishwasher and the machine dishwasher\nAnd actually you can see this happened with the word computer we have this device on her desk now called the computer the people who used to do that kind of really complicated math\nWere also noticed computers so this happens again and again an English where the machine that takes over the human job thing gets to human name so that's part of the reason why interesting yeah it's part of the reason why the dishwashers called the dishwasher the other thing is that in washing machine that word washing referring to the task\nWashing machine that word washing referring to the task of cleaning clothes are doing the laundry is centuries old uh centuries older than any other kind of\nHow stupid is Alexa ... form of any word related to washing like we have long needed to launder are close and we have called them the washing or the laundry for very long time so Washington mean washing clothes\nHas been ensconced in specialized does the word linguist might use specialized this one particular kind of washing since the fourteen hundreds\nSo right now because of washing when you say I'm On a Jew the washing most people probably would assume that you were in the U.S anyway would seem that you were talking about the laundry in the u._k. they might actually think that you met the dishes which is really into\nThis thing and I think the other thing that's going on here too is that dishwashers weren't part of the everyday household and right in this country into all of that fifty right now and that washing machines are a little or will the word torture meaning machine dishwasher dates to the Eighteen sixties right right but I mean in in somebody's home right\nEveryday use of it yeah you had industrial dishwashers radicals dishwashers right so it really or some kind of an order of events here which kind of use became more common sooner than the other ones that kind of\nTakes the mantle as the definitive meaning for that word and you find that again and again in English where\nSomething kind of wins out and so for example in the U. S. football one out as the meaning for American football and in the world football one out meaning soccer and just they become the defended it means a football although there have for centuries been many uh\nThey become the defendant ... football although there have for centuries been many other kinds of football but if you say football people in their mind to think of the one specific more common kind of ... or you are form or\nSo have we preserved peace in your household I guess that's the bigger [laughter] here\n[laughter] I think so but um are you able to call it a cold water or is that those were done\nWell yeah you can but why I'm going to just to be their customers married or a small degree and\nI think the one who loves the laundry and presses the button you know to call it whatever they\nSaid well you're doing the laundry you wherever you want them all she used to watch all the whatever she wants\n[laughter] I'm just fine a tick you and thanks for your call\nAll right thank you Bye bye bye\nGood clean fun on this show eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\nThe conversation we had about the use of the term gypsy and have a lot of people find that offensive right to the Roma people\nWe talked about the gypsy robot which is a tradition on Broadway where um it's among musicals when I'm On opening night uh they'll select the person in the chorus who's been in the most Broadway courses and they get their special road that's passed around\nFrom theater to theater and actor to act and it's called the gypsy rose yes well it was called the gypsy robe but the Irish bell from New York City wrote to point out to us that the actor's equity association has changed the name it's now the legacy row night and they did that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "city": "Reno", "day": "21"}
