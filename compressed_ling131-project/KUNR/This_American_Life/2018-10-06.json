about how we made his choices there's always\nFirst thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because\nOkay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator here and tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind [noise]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nJust stood me up for an interview just leaks fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune in this case though I think he was miserable\nHe just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country\nFlick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination than

history\nAn on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet read over thirty thousand dollars and a couple of days lots of people love this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last week has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to say\nHere's how I knew that story about the elevator about how it
