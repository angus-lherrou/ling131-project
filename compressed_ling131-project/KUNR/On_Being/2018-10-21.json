role emotion plays on every side of our life together in politics and beyond it and caring she insists is not the same as can pitch awaiting\nThat doesn't mean that turkey ... see that's the misunderstanding I think\nEspecially on the left oh if you listen to them that means you've been taken over not at all not at all ... it just means being emotionally intelligent that's right we all need to be makers if you want to make a social contribution help\nBuild a public conversation about the big issues of the day\nYou have to really be good at and emotion that much with [laughter] you know it's a contribution to the larger whole to be really good at that I'm Christian tip at and this is on being\n\nStrangers in their own land with a finalist for the national Book Award or early ... is a professor emeritus at Berkeley and was born in Boston, Massachusetts so you were at the child of a foreign service officer you sound like you grow up all over the world\nYeah I ah lived in Israel

and I spent the summer and gone up by the end I was in college and then they weren't Tunisia so I was very fortunate really to get to experience oh that yeah oh yeah\nWas there I'm a religious or spiritual background to your child hid 'em in your family are in those\nPlaces yeah I Would say um my parents were a very religious Unitarian snow and uh for ... the message I took away is that it's a very big world and we have to learn to\nUh get to know and empathize with and you know people in radically different cultures\nI think by the time I was um [noise] sixteen I had that message but I felt something missing and I got interested in the Quakers who seemed to be much more okay gang so what are we going to do about it you know huge areas were very talkie [laughter]\nTalkers show talk talk talk of the Quakers looked like they were kind of um that they were ...\nYeah well I think you've spoken about how I'm living in that diplomatic world um you know so you are you are known within sociology is the founder of\nThe sociology of emotion and I I just want us to summarize and you tell me if I get this wrong but but she feels important I Want to really dive deep into that so that the backdrop as in terms of how we analyze uh\nThe other world of the south um southwest Louisiana I came to to realize that there were different\nCame to to realize that there were different truths you differently truth and so there are fat so I Believe in the ... she is yeah it's the deep story and again we all have a deep story a\nIt repels certain facts don't fit it and it invites other facts to do [noise]\nI'm Krista tip at indices on being today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion early hope she'll [noise]\n\nYou in strangers in their own land um take up what you call a key whole\nIssue um to kind of go deep into what are the dynamics that collect around a specific subject and to to really understand the dynamics and you're talking about the the great paradox and um [noise] you know you point at this dynamic that in the\nPart of the country you're in there as well first of all and I'm ... and beautiful natural environment and ... great pollution and great relief resistance to regulating polluters and I I think that's such an example of where\nUm people from the outside of all the dynamics that go into that would say um it's just obvious\nAnd but you know there's a the background I think right right [noise] um parts\nGround I think Frank I'm partly I think people I came to know a in Louisiana felt that the federal government was\nA bigger better version of local government and the truth is that in the state of Louisiana a local government out of the state government has not protected people okay from pollution\nYou know there's a there's this passage in in the book that I uh and strangers in their own land that I\nI just just just as an example of this and maybe this person you're talking about you know the ... the state yeah always seems to come down on the little guy he no he says his take this by you if your motor boat league's little gas into the water the war no right you up but if companies leak thousands of gallons of it\nAnd kill all the life here the state lets them go\nRight I have an example hits home it may I can see that\nYes yes the big companies are are so rich and powerful that and say basically have a bond [laughter] the legislature and that there was that the companies have outsourced the moral charity work to the state\nSo they say okay you know let's let's get a legislature that goes along with our developed let's talk jobs jobs jobs\nAnd so the company is with the money that the state gives them ... for it I think it was one point six billion dollars that uh was in the last five years in Louisiana offered to companies\nUh was in the last five years in Louisiana offered to companies yeah to come in with that public money you know came from Texas I'm they then can make donations to the autumn on\nSociety or for a new football uniforms for that was you know looking good and setting up third grade classes in chemistry meanwhile state officials the Louisiana department of environmental quality\nIs being very weak and giving out permits ah [noise]\nAs one of the people I interviewed said like candy so the state looks terrible the company it looks good it's kind of emotional actual manipulation you could say to get you to feel like the company is your friend and to feel like the state is your enemy [noise]\nYeah and there's ... you also describe\nThis interesting dynamic that um that again is is new want strides not something that would be obvious to anybody I mean a lot of this is true but I mean for example you um\nYou you have this chapter called the remembers ... and there is something where you you a decision to send ... about a sociological\nUnderstanding that memory just in general is an indirect expansion of power and then you say so ironically strangely embarrassingly the memory of southern environmental glory fell in part to respectful clerks in federal offices internal environmental is\nSo much complexity there\nYeah [laughter]\nSo much complexity there yeah [laughter] sure heart\nDoes mine yeah oh yeah yeah\nBecause the people I came to know are no more about the environment they know you know which fish are in what area where you said the crab pots where\nYou know what ducks you can shoot at what period of of the year\nThey love their land and yet\nAnd yet they're they're caught I mean people work in the plants and I talked to a woman who said you know I asked you do talk to neighbors about ah environment she said you know our neighbors working plants and\nUh I don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want them to feel accused\nYeah you know as if the people working the plants would take on the guilt right or is that I didn't get along with it and you know and again it's not their personal guilt a it's a company policy and it's a the absence of\nA regulation here the rules you're right you're right like California is very strict rules we enjoy a cleaner environment as a result it's at that level the guilt it's not a personal one right so that was very poignant and sweet of her\nTo be mindful that you know an operator might feel with two ...\n[noise] yeah [noise] and scan like poignant this whole thing gets it as well and what you are shining a light on is the human complexity here\nWell and what you are shining a light on is the human complexity here and we may ... ... it does make things messy right but again I you know I just feel like you are for this is saying let's let's deal with reality not wishful thinking\nAnd\nLet's talk about reality and not wishful thinking by having a simple a respectful public conversation yeah you know where nobody is is bullying conversational anybody else you know new year coming together\nTo see if there can be common ground on the environment\nAnd there can be I think\nThe people I came to know we're very interested and very approving of\nRenewables in fact there's something called the green tea move that as Tea Party that's up all for renewables\nBut we're not even finding common ground because we weren't even respectfully reaching out to look for it right here in our ... still in fact I I think that problem remains with us\nAnd especially on the left I think uh there's a kind of a rigid sort of in for turning I Would say I find it very sad I think we have to reach out looking for potential common ground\n\n[noise]

I think maybe this was a ... interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met over five years of research you\nFound specific issues on which there is potential for coalition\nSafeguarding children on the Internet reducing prison populations for a non violent offenders protecting against commercialization of the human gene I'm pushing for good jobs rebuilding our rail system roads and bridges and our social infrastructure [noise] um\nSo interesting to think about what if we started by saying a what we could start talking about tomorrow right [laughter] well now hanging fruit right yeah\nMhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah mhm\nYou I'm In I'm strangers in their own land you near the end you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal left you write a letter to Louisiana friends on argued see ... you know if you imagine if I if I had a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and\nIn your letter to\nYour friends on the liberal left I was just kind of humanizing and its provocative and human way consider the possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nThat's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that we are products of our own experience you know and what if you grew up in a family um\nYou grew up in a family um but ... said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you know\nI'm OK what does that have been your experience and what if your dad's job and how much you earn was the central fact of your life you know\nAnd what if it was a blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job no [noise] I think there's something actually missing in the\nEntire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or ... people with different political views I went to a different social class and there is a lot of smearing on the left as\nA at the blue collar class that live there Yuri up said look we're the daily workers we're\nClimbing the telephone pole to repair or telephone ... were re paving roads where [noise] who are you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each year\nAnd a I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of\nOld cocoon I've long been here as I Am and a kind of you know it's not only a a contempt that really bothers me now whenever I hear it or see it um\nAnd that is buried to some degree but there's a kind of a reluctance to to read\nBut there's a kind of a reluctance to to reach out at ... on the left there's a lot of good political we'll but it's gotten curled up in\nOnto itself and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong on\nInstead of reaching out to build coalitions 'cause we're a big country not ruins like us I was like them what we need our sturdy coalitions that and I think\nLabor unions when the labor movement was much larger and and uh there there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft\nRight right with different colors and and classes got together natural way they're going to be ... each other they will yeah public school systems um but we're down on those\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year acquired of every one\nOf every one where a very good yeah yeah of everyone and you go to a different reach and get to know people get first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully and listen to actively be immediate everybody should learn those skills and then go cross a to see if we can rebuild does\nThat connective tissue yeah\n[noise] that connective tissue yeah\nI'm I'm sure people have said to you and I I I can into this conversation myself that um\n[noise] there's critique that there are all kinds of groups of people including like people of color um who have long felt like strangers in their own land in this country and they run this late right and yeah yes and especially now yet again and\nIt's when white people that you know the critique that white people wake up to this phenomenon when it's about other white people\nUm how do you have you work with that in your mind it's true and I think it's a it's an important insight\nYes I I think it's an excellent point okay I mean for example the opiate addiction problem has has been oh now they're called a diseases of despair yeah which is kind of a compassionate way crack\nEpidemic\nWith no yeah yeah oh whereas the crack epidemic in the inner cities which it lacks a wasn't it was a criminal and timely yeah yeah that's right yeah even worse so and so it's a point is that should be broadly received mhm [noise]\nI Want to draw too close to suspend just such a big wonderful conversation I'm just kind of curious about that you say somewhere that the English language doesn't give us many words to describe the feeling of reaching out to someone from another world and then\nTo describe the feeling of reaching out to someone from another world and then it says and I ... I ended up having that interest welcomed\nAnd he said some of its own kind mutual is created I just found that intriguing 'cause I think so much about the power of words and I wonder if you had 'em or their words you're using now he's thinking or their friend and branch that gets at a symbols and how important that is for us and in constructing our world [noise]\nWell I use the word empathy and uh\nIt's uh something we're all capable of", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "21"}
