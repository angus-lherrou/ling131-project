modern life\nIn the beginning and you couldn't ever say would be environmental leaders will call the no word and [laughter]\nWomen the L Word was love and it's really when someone's heart ... that things really change I\nThat things really change I had been more and more willing to take the risk to offer those practices even in just very secular working situations recently than I used to be\nBecause people really want to look for it turns out [laughter] and I'm\nAlways edges on sounding like a hallmark card but I have found it to be very powerful if you can find the right way to do it\nI'm Krista tip it and this is on being nearby blessed she is co founder and former director of the center for contemplative mind in society she's just written a new book together with ROM DOS walking each other home conversations on loving and dying we spoke into that I'm Fifteen\nSo I Wonder how would you start to describe what the spiritual background of your childhood of your life or early life\nMy early life\nI was brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and this is right after the war I say the second world [laughter]\nAnd you have to be the war [laughter] and um [noise]\nThere wasn't daycare so my mother would drop me off at the church and I'd go to mass every morning and then I just go right over to the school they were both across the street from us so I was in church every morning for my whole childhood\nChurch every morning for my whole childhood\nAnd um I think you know the Catholic children are\nPart of the way morals and ethics are taught is through the models of the lives of the St right so there were a lot of really pretty extraordinary and some preposterous stories of saints [laughter] but I really loved I'm Joan of arc\nYeah I read that and I do an interesting idea that Joan of and so I'm just learning how to Joan of arc and by the aspirations have a girl in Madison New Jersey [laughter] well\nRuined her life is a lot more interesting than mine [laughter] I don't I I I liked that but she did start out as a kind of ordinary little girl and then\nMeditation we still had the model of it being monastic and so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just no one could imagine [laughter] right [laughter] ah [laughter]\nSo but I was just as committed as everybody else\nTo finding a way to bring this into um our lives and the west so first I started a\nBusiness with my then husband John Bush and I was in Ireland missions and yeah yeah I thought when I was most interested in at Lehman nations was integrating this sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who work there wanted to learn to meditate but we integrated in ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice in ... you know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know\nIt's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more complicated and\nNow we recognize that it's more complicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah so we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words\nAs you can appreciate [laughter] yeah so I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood you know where what you're making\nIs wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the BCS and and at the same time the way in which you're doing it is helping everyone who's involved to wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years later\nArrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person more creative more able to ah bring their their whole self into work and to be able to grow\nFrom their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\nOn the right to say [noise] that is a shaft that is still a still has a long\nWay to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture\nIdeals and practicalities\nOr and ideals and and practicality is yeah this story of search inside yourself\nFirst of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find that language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take yeah\nUh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemporary of mine and he called up and well first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so he'd been thinking for some time at Google\nThat or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter] and um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide but it was so men decided it was going to be bringing meditation and shut our posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help so I went out there and we talk to and we looked around and\nWhat we identified was that people are employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise]\nTop of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise] had been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm after talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there\nI suggested that we could\nOffer the same practices but emphasize the practices that that more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and then a different way and so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they're the big search engine search inside yourself\nAnd then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny go home and who also is in bug guy or with us back all the right guy\nI'm asked him to give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and on the relationship between meditation and emotional intelligence he did that and then we posted the course\nAnd in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand Google lawyers around the world have taken the course and\nThere's a lot of talk now about\nBringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it\nHelps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question anything it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing\nBut this is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down can calm quiet stable you have to do that in order for any kind of insight\nDo you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes you know really disturbing emotions rise but it needs to be taken to the next kind of level of depths in order for people to begin to\nQuestion right there\nBut this course actually offers enough time practice and a teaching to help people do that\n[noise] I mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that is you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] I mean there's not as can be superficial and it can be abused like any like any spiritual practice like yeah politically correct is um [noise]\nBut you know nearby something that really so intrigues me in um in your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise]\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has\nYou know has this very noble lineage um you know it's what is um that is the tradition that has focused on this for ... years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again is a very root of judgment character and will\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was ... but that is the\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was what is that that is the intention right have yeah that is and that's just quite amazing\nAnd then in the seventies you had a somebody\nWho actually I had never heard of David McClelland yay and William James hall mhm um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to this you know David than Daniel Goldman cliffs Erin marketing\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker\nAnd then something in your work they ... through\nAnd seeing that this contemplative impulse\nIs kind of human tradition as much as it yeah it's in their religious traditions I'm In ... center Owen cs Lewis and the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that forward for me and it's really critically\nHim so much [laughter]\nI'm honored [laughter] yeah but\nTrue when we started the center for can jump out of mind we uh we're looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful in sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it had started\nAnd um we interviewed eighty people we identified this was in Ninety six and seven so it was early but we kind of word of mouth heard and knew\nA number of people in different fields who were beginning to integrated into their work or their organizations and we Andrew you're eighty people\nIntegrated into their work or their organizations and we interviewed eighty people and we ask them for what practices they were there's and that they were teaching or [noise] and um we gathered\nThese hundred practices from all the different traditions it I mean all the religious and spiritual and of course psychological traditions to\nThey are human practices they really about waking up to who we are appreciating and we are opening our hearts recognizing compassion recognizing that you know there's a way in which\nIn a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done a yoga class you know none of it's like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know\n[laughter] as soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brass fan and I saw these arm's reach out [laughter] I'm\nProud of their phones and about lying down [laughter] sorry for far right they brought their phones in front of their faith [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... what's the sec religious right [laughter] right\nWell okay so I knew were denied oh beautiful workers Google and Google is part of the problem here yeah and it to the point that nothing is pure and um but you also written about and it's very practical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about\nYeah that's really ... yeah yeah um we devise that at Google [laughter] loved that she put her magazine um I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um [noise]\nYou just type out your email either a response\nYou just type out your email either a response or an initiating email and then you stop takes three D. press follow your brass\nIn and out in and out and in and out and then you read the email\nAnd you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be agitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion\nOr maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever we asked them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it there was a week in between the classes and so a week later and they came back and we said how did it go and um\nThey all said that was radical you know [laughter] I'm amazing and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what is that I picked up the phone [laughter]\nYou know I mean there we all are emailing to the people on the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful\nReally helpful I wanted to go back for a minute because I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really house yeah I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that\nA leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nYeah but what mindfulness compassion practices others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body\nAnd then notice what your anger is see it and recognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time holds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger 'cause it clouds mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate acronym Annie and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to both see\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on a communicated we did a lot of work with lawyers and\nAnd see how that Los Angeles or anything about that I Want to ask you about that is so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter]\nThey wanted to learn how to be non judgemental\n[laughter] it's I mean we we laugh but it has\nYou know it they will lawyers worry that\nCan they be a zealous advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men is not eliminating wise discernment\nIt's eliminating pre judgment so that day judges are unbelievably overworked\nThey have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know some young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking that this is probably who he is and what he's done right\nAnd they can't not having that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff\nBut they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so just being there and really listening to what's actually being said\nThat can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and\nThey loved it oh yeah I just read in a a science magazine at the present moment as we experienced it as a pet two to three seconds long\n[laughter] kind of interesting great like physically like what we experience as a present moment is too yeah and also that you can then it can be a longer\nAnd also that you can that it can be a longer\nRight which is all you meditate or have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there can be yeah [laughter] [noise]\nI'm Krista tip it induces on being today with Buddhist teacher mirror by Bush who works at the intersection of industry social healing and diverse contemplative practices\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice [noise]\nIt's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I should say like for myself I have some I've had many experiences across the ears on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise]\nEven a kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously\nGratifying right it can be just transformative and now they're asleep and all this science about how good it is for us on these very big like biological levels and stress and all that but it's very hard to\nCreate this habit and has been hard for me I I've recently I wanted to ask you about this since I have you [noise]\nYou know I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my piece tapes which just\nCould do six minutes in the morning while my teeth states which just seems so pathetic but you know it's and you just get it out of our time yeah\nAnd I wonder um I Want to ask you this you work with so many different practices I mean there is this something where you really do have to find their way that works for you yeah well\nThe center we we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered you know we've had a Buddhist teacher\nAnd a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices brother David teaching Christian practices um someone doing to be chanting we've done it that way and then\nInvite people to find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple practices like um\nMindfulness other breads and walking meditation right and my listening and so on as an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate the begin to reshape the inner life\nAnd the benefit that comes from as you said I mean\nIt's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels yeah after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation or that once people begin to experience that that they will find what works for them the other thing I wanted to say is that\nThere's so much work being done with\nMindfulness and that is a great introductory\nPractice but when I have found in ...\nPractice but when I have found in the beginning you couldn't ever say what the uh environmental leaders are called the L Word and\nThey didn't mean lesbian meant [laughter] limits the L Word was love", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Reno", "day": "28"}
