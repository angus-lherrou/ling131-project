being a date with the poet lately long filter\n\n\n\nQuestion I'm always kind of pursuing in each individual life\nIs its own way and to this question\nIs you know what what does it mean to be him and\nUm and I also know that that every one of our sense of that is constantly evolving cross life but there's some things you said about riding high signed so intriguing\nI feel like the way you've written about them as hell writing forms you as a human being like you wrote somewhere um it's an endeavor I go into a now provide solid deep joy\nPerhaps is joy from writing seated comfortably in my court because of a life lesson it provided writing has shown me what happened with the patient ... and some place else you wrote the surprises I've experienced in my writing practice have dislodged me from curiosity into love [laughter]\nI Wonder if you could say a little bit about those qualities and as a way into the question if what if\nYou're learning about what it means to be human through the likes of usually\nI'm I think the writing practice um it was something that I had not expected to be a good fit\nTo be a good fit\nI had never thought oh I Want to be a writer one day\nBut I went to the Institute of American indian arts and um they didn't have a music program that's what I wanted to study right [laughter] but I really wanted to go to school there so I felt like the next best thing was to study writing\nAnd um it was not easy a lot of uh I Would say the first three three and a half years I wrote some really really really bad bad bad poems like really dry it took me a long time\nBut I think it was that patients that is something I've learned through writing a sense of patients and their reward mhm that comes from that\nEven I'm just now thinking about the peace thirty eight but that piece for example took me\nI Want to say maybe a year and a half to two years to write what it was important to me it's kind of an ethics piece it's like six pages long yeah yeah yeah would you just briefly say what what's happening in that piece\nIn thirty yeah\nBriefly in thirty eight it's um written to and for the Dakota thirty four I'm thirty eight ... men who were Hong under the orders of I'm President Abraham\nUnder the orders of I'm President Abraham Lincoln um as a result of this sue appraising\nWhich came at a time when the court to people there um territory their land was\nWas getting smaller and smaller and um and finally down to something like a ten mile tract and the people duck what people do not have um hunting rights beyond that\nUh and basically um and they had no se a\nStore credit with the traders and so they were basically starving so there was an uprising\nAnd I'm as a result um these thirty eight men were hung and then ... ... people were moved west to South Dakota area in different um basically they lost their land\nAs large as legal math execution in us history and yes and it happened the same week that President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation yes that is raised tree we don't know that three or we don't teach 'em yeah [noise]\nSo so you were just talking so this took along this emerged troop patient writing all of this\nAh absolutely I just think um that I've learned through writing the reward and the joy that comes out of just being really patient with peace and patient with yourself I think at least for me the imagination if something\nFor me the imagination is something that I have to really respect\nLike its own little person yeah [laughter] and so we can't demand too much of it sometimes they have to let her\nTake a rest and then come back and being conversation with it again but it's a beautiful process that I've learned through writing\nMm yeah I was looking at page sixty four ... whereas I did not desire and childhood and also page sixty five which was another you know part of the way you also reflected on what an apology is right is about your experience", "show_name": "On Being", "year":
