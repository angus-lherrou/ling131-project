W. J. F. dot org\nWe generally avoids the lightning rod figures on this show\nBut earlier this year the University of Montana in Missoula a blue city in a red state invited on being to attempt an outside the box civil conversation between two pundits with big followings on contrasting ends of the U. S. political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield who famously model\nSpirit of Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the partisan aisle in the two most of the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally cone who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News\nShe just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate Sally has to be paired with Erick Erickson she was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation the two of them had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who waited in a long line they told me they'd come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThey were instead exhilarated\nIn the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagine that this was possible\nA true back and forth marked at once by bedrock difference and goodwill and humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our arguments our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening Mm\nI'm ... and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the Denison theater in Missoula, Montana and was co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nYou know as as I uh moved through two thousand sixteen\nSo you know as as I uh\nMoved through two thousand sixteen um\nWhat started being clear to me kind of midway through the air is who ever won\nUm\nThe deep work that we were going to have to do as a society was about was human work about repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that had suddenly become on you know we could no longer not see it\nAnd that somehow that was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum\nTaking some kind of stock in terms of how we got to this place and um you know Sally you ah\nYou know you you mean you have to say you're a liberal like your credentials are from um\nThank you and I don't think [laughter]\nI've worked really hard yeah okay\nThat you tell a story that I found very you know and you know how you you grew up\nAs a community organizer and you know if you said that you know right wing or somewhere my enemies and I hated them and you even grow up in a kind of ... up with a philosophy of community organizing that formed a lot of people that you're political enemies or devils\n'em and you you've worked to not be that way but in this election that all re service for you um you tell the story and I think also something that you both have in common is you're both parents are right in the thick of parenting and that's influencing how this reckoning you're doing and you tell a story of being in your\nLovely leafy neighborhood block party in Brooklyn in the summer of two dozen sixteen and and there was a penny out of Donald Trump's head\nOne thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just pools talking to neo Nazis and talking to a terrorist people think their motivation is fundamentally good\n...\nThese tows didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was ...\nAnd these trials didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or cruel or unkind um\nAnd and in fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of being called things I Can't repeat on public radio and online\nUm and they're going through a real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still\n[noise] um no one thinks they're mean no one thinks their hateful no one wants to be hateful\nOkay how do we do with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're I mean this well the only thing I was just saying that this was I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which arises like Ryan tweeting now but still there were like\nI didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and we've forgotten it's or it could hurt you that they make you feel the way you were feeling and they had the opportunity a lot of them apologized ... thanks but why did you then do it right and the sort of it has something to do with\nA lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\nAnd so I mean there are studies that when people have to uh you know are sort of challenge to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly so there's this ...\nOf technology that allows us to fuel the demonization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurturing amplify it yeah yeah yeah\n[noise] um mhm\nSo I mean part of what I think we do\n[noise] um mhm so I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem\nRight and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse I happened to have an opinion on the matter about uh I'm actually an honest what I really think I'm curious do you agree with this Eric is I've come to think that\nUh that the left by and large uh is\nNicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity in general [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we could somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what like let's try to do both um but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have a habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other uh-huh\nAnd we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people my liberal and say oh they're game Trump supporters me that there's still a system there so as long as ... I hate them\nBecause they're so hateful I hate it out of\nIt and we blame the people for then expressing these use as though not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in\nPeople's\nIntention to be good and\nAssume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a script\nAnd I assume\nI Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard\nTo assume I tried very hard to assume that you liked me\nIn spite of some of the some of the things I Know you've read and and and er and ... written and said about gay people\nI still don't assume you mean me uh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I Want to believe the best and people and it seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best of me\nYou've actually called that a daily spiritual practice I guess that's just you know or I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught in one of the related dynamics swell up this\nWhich is that the culture we've created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like them so but in a been a very particular instance are you said something I mean you said a lot of us here at pundit but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret\nYou said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm route a whole chapter in the book about that well yes\nAnd um and the word goat was in it and yes and also to talk too much about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was to talk to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet but\nSomebody came through and energy and beyond loud ... ask Erick Erickson what\nA you know saying this has to do with repairing\nThen what are you saying that this has\nTo do with repairing civil discourse ...\nYou know you usually only made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine\nAnd ... it was just I didn't know anybody but it a couple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it was someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since\nUm but the number of people who still bringing up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see there's about the right actually I wrote several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes their way and\nThe common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing point in this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care\nUh and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like worker record all this but it really is where my heart is right now\nThat it only matters when we're oblivious\nTo the people in our city block\nTo the homeless people in our community when it's just national politics when Washington is the be all end all of everything everything's abstract because none of us are in Washington\nYou know look I think it's very ... two points it's it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... it could be the solution right because we have to remember that\nBefore the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still\nEd segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that\n... that especially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have been shaped led to a a lot of my opium so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to hate last and I think progressive should lead the way\nTo go first to\nFeel like look to the points that were making here or if there was a sign that said that professes\nUm that people can change and grow\nAnd in fact that is a core of progressive politics is that please don't stay where we've been as a country in the divisiveness of racial\nSegregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality we are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that\nThat demands it invites change in the country and an individual\nAnd so if you if if your vision involves people changing and growing then you have to be able to literally practice what you preach and create space for people to change in ...\nWhen you see this because I've said something somewhere on the right that you know we've we've gotta we've got to improve within a preview others are we going to ... and I get a lot these days will that unilateral disarmament\nAnd I get a lot these days will that unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna there's this is absolutely use those ... lack of faith to believe the other side is capable of grew in\nYeah I um I get it to 'em I still have friends and you know activists and organizers who feel like hate and and ... is one of the strongest tools in their toolbox\nUm you know look I just I always returned to I'm One of my favorite quotes Martin Luther king quote and he says darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that yeah\nHate is not the answer to hate and he said hey is too great a burden to bear correct yeah and it and you can't hate your way out of hate yeah I don't know what I Want to say liberals and I love that definition of progressive but I don't think progressive have you\nKnow a corner on the market of leaving and human growth and change right and and you are a at a devout evangelical Christian and conversion is an important value and belief in Christianity\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself these are two ways streets they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else is saying [noise]\nUm I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological uh it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we have a quick progress\nOn gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out of Mexican for so [laughter]\nAre there are studies that you know look kids who go to racially integrated elementary schools ... grow out\nGo to racially integrated elementary schools how grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh\nActivities and after school programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other but then\nHas a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually I have actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask us we um [noise]\nAs we wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree right and that in fact uh\nWe really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a a proposition is that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called come in life\nThat if it is about also just learning to disagree better\nWhen we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally\nSaid I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and Eric ... yeah usually I just wanted them not well paid your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been and can still be on social media\nSo so this is a work in progress for any of us we're all sinners um what is the experience you have of what does shift\nUm what is the experience you have of what does shift what shifts what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um\nHave had the experience myself of being unexpectedly kind\nThe face of people being cruel on line or off\nAnd seeing the difference it makes in yourself in for Neal better [noise] I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it [noise]\nUm but it and then as well mhm uh people write back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might and likely [laughter] uh\nI had the privilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories of people who were you know professional hate mongers\nOr kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things and who the targets of that hate\nShowed\nAnd generosity and transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they had been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of that\nThinking we're hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware\nOf the power of the burden that\nIn a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at the receiving end of more of the hate\nShould have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I I get that there are times where it feels daily unjust and him and in some cases it's too much to ask for long enough to laugh at us and the other hand this is where\nThose of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up and and also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people like they are all\nExtraordinary and beautiful in equal and so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work\nI I'm blown away by the difference it makes\nKnow I'm always struck um ... if it just ... to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture but what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel and it's not the fall short putting the apple it's actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears the world God says it's not good for men to be alone\nThat's the first bad loneliness and so many of us can caught relationships and communities on line\nAnd we're still alone and then we get in our tribes are Republican conservative liberal progressive Democrats will that tribes then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle\nAnd then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle with the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other and it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more and more\nTo to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people and you know we went with a wife\nWho has cancer and I know we're we're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line\nOr and not there ah I'm more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related ...\nThat we both began having these internal conversations um with having kids\nUm that level of local and I don't mean to keep our local here there's not an additional just community physical real break bread community and in my book I Am a firm believer that everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home\nAnd bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know um there's a there's a great Christian author was area Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse and she writes to the Christian Community a lot that you and there is no better community in America than the gay community\nWhere an unlocked door and a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that our blessings our blessings to\nShared with other people [noise]\nWe're blessed to be sure with with me\nPrefer Jesus ball\nIt is\nWe under value in the twenty first century review community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be sold around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them\n[noise] I'm going to fit this is on being today with Eric Ericson and Sally [noise] okay we could\nFinish one minute early which would please something deep in my radio bones but I'd really like to get can we just keep going for five more minutes you're better\nI mean I've had um [noise] I don't know if this is a I just want to bring\nUp with the two of you and in this room that very much on my mind is so happy we haven't talked about the White House tonight right just because we're so fixated ride from William for\nReally because there's more to life and there's more to politics has more to us in politics and um some things that puzzles me and I'm curious about the two of you\nBecause you are in that world is that on so many of these things on which were so divided in which a lot of hate gets thrown around by the extremes which we allowed to define and frame of are important discussions\nThere's this middle ground this vast middle ground where people aren't the same but you know for example I mean you know for a long time\nYou know for example I mean you know for a long time it's been true that on abortion\nYou know something like sixty to sixty five percent of Americans across party lines saver you know abortion with limit now there's a big conversation about what those limits are but rather than always having the same fight about it's always right or it's always wrong", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city":
