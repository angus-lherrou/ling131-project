your retirement money\nYou see when you suffer a loss in the market\nEven if it's a small loss you have three problems the lost value is just one problem the second problem is the time it takes to make back that loss\nBut the third problem is is it's almost impossible for you to regain your losses let me explain if you have a market exposed account of a hundred thousand dollars and the market drops by thirty percent your account has dropped to Seventy thousand very painful right\nBut that's just the beginning imagine the markets go back up the following year by thirty percent [noise] do you think you're back to your original hundred thousand the real answer is absolutely not now why not it's the cruel math of losses\nHere's why after dropping thirty percent the account is at Seventy thousand\nSo the thirty percent gain in the following year on the way back up again on only Seventy thousand thirty percent of Seventy thousand there's only Twenty one thousand and when you add the Twenty one to the Seventy that's left over it's only Ninety One thousand\nSo the real math is that it would take a forty three percent gain just to get back to where we started which was a hundred thousand\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out on top of the loss\nThat's why people rarely recover lost\nReal answer is absolutely not now why not it's the cruel math of losses\nHere's why after dropping thirty percent the account is at Seventy thousand\nSo the thirty percent gain in the following year on the way back up again on only Seventy thousand thirty percent of Seventy thousand there's only Twenty one thousand and when you add the Twenty one to the Seventy that's left over it's only Ninety One thousand\nSo the real math is that it would take a forty three percent gain just to get back to where we started which was a hundred thousand\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out on top of the loss\nThat's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my list is is is when does negative thirty plus forty three equals zero and the answer when you lose thirty percent in the market it takes me forty three percent again just to get back to zero\nHere's another question when does negative thirty equals zero and the answer is one year my client that's because my clients have no possibility of market losses\nSo you never have to worry about trying to regain those losses also upfront bonuses of up to ten percent when you begin your account in a guaranteed lifetime income account that contractually guaranteed to grow up to seven percent per year for income purposes\nIf any of this is confusing I'll be happy to explain it to you when you call eight four four three seven one seven to three three get your customize save money
