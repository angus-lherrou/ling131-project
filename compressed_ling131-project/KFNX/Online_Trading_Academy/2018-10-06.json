buying a home is one of the largest purchases they'll ever make what risk to you have when you buy a home for one you ever ask a market value lost many people learned that in two thousand eight right\nMany people thought that there was no significant risk from your home and going down in value but that perception is now changed forever what about risk of property loss flood fire earthquake when storm or theft those are all things that could destroy the value of your home investment\nOther properties you might only have the same risks if you own a car a boat airplane or any other property was significant value there is a risk of loss when you own something of significant material value what do you do to protect yourself from\nFinancial loss\nI think you know the obvious answer here you get insurance on those assets right insurance costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they'll probably never use so why would you buy insurance on your home\nYou might say well I have a loan on my house so I have to buy insurance on it so that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for would you still buy insurance on your home I bet you would but why\nWhether you realize it or not\nYou'd buy insurance on your home because of something called a catastrophic risk\nCatastrophic risk means that you have any chance even if it's a small chance to lose a lot of value in other words you can lose a lot of money if something bad happens the reason we buy insurance on our home is because the cost of insurance is very small compare\nThe answer here you get insurance on those assets right insurance costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they'll probably never use so why would you buy insurance on your home\nYou might say well I have a loan on my house so I have to buy insurance on it well that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for which is still buy insurance on your home I bet you would but why\nWhether you realize it or not you'd buy insurance on your home because of something called the catastrophic risk catastrophic risk means that\nYou have any chance even if it's a small chance to lose a lot of value in other words you could lose a lot of money if something bad happens the reason we buy insurance on our home is because the cost of insurance is very small compared to the last we might incur if a catastrophic event happens\nJust for the fun of it\nLet's assume you live in a modern home it's up to current building codes you don't smoke and fall asleep and your bad you don't light candles and leave them on attended and you don't put fried chicken on the stove and leave the catch it\nThat's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my list is is is when does negative thirty plus forty three equals zero and the answer when you lose thirty percent in the market it takes me forty three percent again just to get back to zero\nHere's another question when does negative thirty equals zero\nAnd the answer is one year my client that's because my clients have no possibility of market losses\nSo you never have to worry about trying to regain those losses also upfront bonuses of

[noise]\nHere's a question I'd like to ask you how much of your money is currently in the market\nAll of it half of it\nDid you make a conscious decision\nTo have that particular percentage exposed to market risk or did it just sort of happened\nWhy am I asking as I said before the markets go up and the markets go down how much of your life savings that exposed to market risk\nIs a very important consideration for you that's why I strongly encourage everyone to think about their money in terms of bread money and green money those terms may sound funny but I Believe they can help us understand a very important concept and let me explain why\nRead money is money that we're willing to exposed to market risk in hopes of a higher return with red money we accept the possibility of losses even significant losses in hopes of greater gains\nRed money is always exposed to the upside and downside of market risk\nGreen money on the other hand is about safety and security was green money were not willing to accept the risk of losses so this money typically we're willing to accept a lower return in exchange for safety and security\nGreen money does not have downsides market risk so red money's exposed the upside and downside market risk angry money has only upside market potential which ones better\nWell that's probably the wrong question to be asking because neither one is inherently good\nIn hopes of a higher return with red money we accept the possibility of losses even significant losses in hopes of greater gains red money is always exposed to the upside and downside of market risk\nGreen money on the other hand is about safety and security when green money were not willing to accept the risk of losses showed this money typically we're willing to accept a lower return in exchange for safety and security\nGreen money does not have downsides market risk\nSo red money's exposed upside and downside market risk angry money has only upside market potential which ones better well that's probably the wrong question to be asking because neither one is inherently good or bad\nIt all depends on your situation the very important question we should ask ourselves or these what percentage of my money should be in red money and what percentage of my money should be angry and money if you're at or near retirement you should ask yourself if any of your money should be in red money\nAre you willing to lose any of your retirement funds\nCan you afford to lose any of your retirement funds would you rather take two steps forward and three steps back or just take one step at a

at least lose some of their money and still live comfortably now by rich I mean those people who have adequate green money to guarantee that they'll always have the income they need and never outlive it and still have money left over for red money\nIf you're at or near retirement you should definitely be in the green which is money that can't be lost due to market declines many people believe that all retirement money should be green money personally I think that makes a lot of sense\nMany people I work with regardless of age want one hundred percent green money because they know that they can
