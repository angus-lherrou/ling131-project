have you heard of something called the financial illustration you've probably had and just maybe don't know it\nWhen you go and you see a financial planner that it's in the business of risking your money they might use their computer software to run examples of what could happen to your money\nSometimes these examples are based on historical data and sometimes they're flat out just as Derek all\nI had a client the other day that showed me an illustration from their broker that demonstrate a what would happen to their money if it continued to grow over the next ten years at twelve percent compound a growth can you believe that ... percent compounded growth where do financial planners get the nerve to even print that on paper\nWhat's even crazier is I've never seen an illustration from one of these brokers that shows what happens to clients' money if they wake up one day and fifty percent of their money is gone now why not couldn't that happened you better could and in fact some here today\nMight be in that very situation it's so easy for financial sales people did show you the best possible results and then just to be fair show you may be some moderate losses on these illustrations\nI think every financial professional should be required to show their prospective clients what the worst results were from the clients they manage let me ask you if you were thinking about working with a financial planner and you found out that they had lost fifty percent of their clients retirement funds would you want to work with them\nWell now that I brought it up you're
