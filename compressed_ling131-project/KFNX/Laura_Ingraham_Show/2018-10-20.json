I Can't believe that all these years have passed since I graduated back in the mid nineties so I'm dating myself\nMan does your young come on come on to those those since the mid nineties\nSo when I

whole\nWell you sound right up my earliest will keep going with a with where's it whether it's taken years an entrepreneur and your connection was ...\nAbsolutely so I'm getting there for sixteen

Washington and physically not here you know her her presence in her\n... her great mentorship Harvard covered over me and it really kept me on the straight and narrow and it really begin to pursue some of my higher dreams and higher calling you know from my life is so I ended up meeting a gentleman while we were um continue in our relationship and I really appreciate her because one\nOf the former governor would come and make this a patients at my church is she would call me and say hey I Want you to be the host and I was so on and like you pick me to\nYou know hold the governor the bottle and I know what the ... would you with her right hand woman on my notes so\nShe she just felt a lot about me more than I thought about myself as far as my my journey so back where I met the gentleman that kind of changed the course of my direction um he he's actually you know live with a valley ... there'll be more in I guess that's the thing is I Would pick your psyche ... wrote the book respect for that\nAnd he came to one of the boys Girls Club I specifically I was managing\nA short short great relationship started from there I gave him my vision and that was to create twenty millionaires and make Twenty years in the inner city teaching on education\nUrban to the urban urban inner city kids and so for the last Thirteen Years he's been mentoring me in that direction where

kind of change the course of my direction um he he's actually you know live with the valley to ... there'll be more in his name is Robert ... ... wrote the book rich that poured out\nAnd he came to one of the boys Girls Club I specifically I was managing\nA short short great relationship started from there I gave him my vision and that was to create twenty millionaires and makes Twenty years in the inner city teaching on education urban urban urban inner city kids\nAnd so for the last Thirteen Years he's been mentoring me in that direction where you get some measures I'm telling you I I've got some mentors and I've been incredibly blessed\nLet me pick up a we a lot more to do with news well Trina who you only go to our other guest I'm a Christian ... let's get back on you Christian okay so we we don't want to leave you out as we know when you got stuff too so let's find a little bit about you\nOkay well uh my background is in education and specifically communication I have taught at ASU for\nAlmost Twenty years wow so my entire adult life has been working in higher education to communication I teach and the communication about a minute so I teach human communication okay what do you how do you do\nHow do you are differentiated from communication in general so we have in and ask you we have several different departments to deal with communication we have mediated communication which would be what we're doing here um Cronkite school together in the chronicle I'm In the heat down school\nAnd they can school focuses on inter personal communication\nIntercultural communication organizational communication health communication so the communication that happens\nWith out you know cameras and videos although we do talk about that that as well but a lot of it is how we form relationships and uh how we can continue to have those inter personal relationship might specific focus I I'm a research methods and statistics teacher [laughter]\nI I Love it it is it is my favorite thing to teach I get very excited when they start talking about studies and how we can evaluate\nYou do you like do big papers and things like that and ... statistical research things like that I buy\nA lot of it as I Am struck down though and I feel like right in the current environment it's so important that we understand and we encourage critical thinking among our young people\nThat's what the pie too we had ... too familiar to that was talking about critical thinking and\nWhen he was on the show a couple of weeks ago a ... to um merchandising with the people and recruiting yeah so\nUm my my other background as an academic debate and so I Am that aspect of communication where we there's the given taken so when you're talking about finding common ground I think it's it's really important and that has been lacking for a long time\nCritical thinking and common grown and it's every day the show's going to be really powerful and we're going for a cause usually try to get\nAll these gifts back for next week's show as well but you've got something else on your list right now don't you know mistaken so\nUm I have a very similar story to Julie a in early may I was\nWatching as Seventy five thousand teachers parents and students transcended on the capital to send it on the capital and I went why are we not making the changes that have been asked for for so long um and I went to look up online and see who was running in my local legislative district so I could volunteer\nAnd help them get elected and lo and behold nobody was running unbelievable so I talked to my husband and said\nI have not prepared for this I have not plan for this but we need to have we need to have somebody running in every race to hold people who are currently in power accountable uh and I think that I can do it and therefore you running for oh I'm running for state Senate and legislative district Fifteen\nIn early may I was\nWatching as Seventy five thousand teachers parents and send it on the capital are dependent on the capital and I went why are we not making the changes that have been out for for so long um and I went to look up online and see who was running in my local legislative districts like volunteer\nAnd help them get elected and lo and behold nobody was riding unbelievable I talk to my husband and sad\nI have not prepared for this I have not plan for that but we need to have that we need to have somebody running in every right to hold people who are currently in power accountable uh and I think that I can do it and therefore what are you running for I'm running for state Senate and legislative district again\nWell it's interesting I'm listening to train a talk about the discrepancy and and the gap that we have and we have not only an income gap in Arizona we have a wealth gap\nAnd so obtaining that wealth and sustaining it and um I think I Do think education is in a very important element to kind of closing that wealth gap and closing that income gap\nAnd what we've seen in Arizona is we have stopped funding are higher education we stop funding R. K. through twelve education or that community colleges have gotten no money from the state for the last couple of years\nOur universities are really struggling as well um luckily we have some university presidents who were pretty innovative and how they reach out and get\nFunding but one of the reasons that I'm running for office is I Would really like to see a program where we can uh make community college available to every adult in Arizona because that advancing education even if it's not a full four year degree but a vocational school or a community college for two years can really help kind of lower that wealth gap\nOkay so what are your thoughts on uh I had a friend that was doing a online high school\nOr what do you think about those kind of classes that where they can get there they can graduate or they get their GED or whatever through an online type of high school so\nI Am I've taught online uh since Nineteen for a long time\n[laughter] [noise] yeah [noise]\nUm and I think that you know there are ways that we can really create truly innovative and um acceptable programs on line from a university perspective it it's wonderful because I have students in my class who never\nWould have been able to be in a traditional classroom and I think it is so powerful to have those students and interact with those students on a regular basis I'm and I'm so proud of my online students for getting to that point\nSince we'd be finished high school through online ... college she was a young person my school let me I'll I'll backtrack I was just talking though for high school I think that there are some areas where it's appropriate we have students in rural areas\nThe high school so\nI Am I've taught online uh since Nineteen for a long time [laughter]\nAnd I had a great great [noise] yeah [noise]\nUm and I think that you know there are ways that we can really create truly innovative and um acceptable programs on line from a university perspective it it's wonderful because I have students in my class\nWho never ever would have been able to be in a traditional classroom and I think it is so powerful to have those students and interact with those students on a regular basis\nI'm and I'm so proud of my online students for getting to that point and she'll be finished high school through online ... college she was a private school let me I'll I'll backtrack I was just talking though\nFor high school I think that there are some areas where it's appropriate we have students in rural Arizona who may not have access to high quality\nYou know advanced math classes that now they can get advanced math classes on line that can get advance science classes online um I think the larger issue that a lot of this is a when we're done through you know charter schools like primavera\nWe need to have more on a more overlook um for those schools because we've seen some of the the consequences of that was certainly\nHaven't been through a number of charter schools as well as the pure Unified School district\nUm there\nBecause I like what you're saying about oversight seems to be very appropriate in terms of I think like charter schools\nCan be a wide variety of experiences in relation to the online and do that for a lot of kids who struggle to finish out high school the on line has been the go to thing but it's it's again it's all across the map in terms of how whether it works how it works when he was your question Neal and I my experience has been\nUm it depends on who always who's who's supporting the kid to get through something it seems like\nYeah ... and how it's designed I mean I've ... I've designed several courses to be um implement it on line I'm currently designing a mattress course for online implementation\nAnd it really depends on what are the resources that you have probably better at higher or do you think maybe I think in higher ed it's it's wonderful and higher ed because we can we can educate people who are not able to physically leave a job who are not able to make it to traditional and they're not they're pretty motivated to produce motivated I mean let's talk about\nThe technology on the next segment though I Want to ask you a question are you opposed at all in your run for Senate in district Fifteen\nI Am oppose so the I Am running against a woman who has been in the legislature for ten years and she is transitioning from the house of representatives to runs make a run for the Senate\nOkay well let's get Julian minute before we and our segment let's hear a little bit about your ... one of the things I Want to say what was your experience in ... I Love it oh I'm\nSo you've you've got a different angle to how you came to politics for example ... I'm from a from a lawyer standpoint right so I'm a prosecution standpoint\nYeah that's right in fact this is something that I never thought I Would do because when you prosecute politicians for a living I tend to leave a bad taste in your mouth for for politics generally by\nChicago right which is rooted like the Supreme of frame of a of of potential corruption it's on\nRight I mean I think Arizona's really giving them a lot [laughter]\nLet me interject here has really won't say this but the things that she was prosecuting for in Chicago or actually legal in Arizona oh\nReally well that's the truth [laughter] we're we're we're running out of time in this segment but there's so much more to cover in in ... in the last three things we got ... no ... give me a highlight of prosecuting corrupt politicians ... will be a highlight of something\nCame to politics for example ... I'm from a from a lawyer standpoint right so I'm a prosecution standpoint\nYeah that's right in fact this is something that I never thought I Would do because when you prosecute politicians for a living I tend to leave a bad taste in your mouth or or politics generally by\nA night in Chicago right which is really like the Supreme of the frame of a of of potential corruption at times\nRight I mean I think Arizona's really giving [laughter] let me interject here to Philly won't say that but the thing that she was prosecuting for in Chicago or actually legal in Arizona oh\nReally that's where we're we're running out of time in this segment but there's so much more to cover in And Julian into the last three things we've got to bail for right now give me a highlight of prosecuting corrupt politicians which will be a highlight of something that you didn't have that\nWell I was on the indictment team for the highest up I'm In the political hierarchy that the cook county state's attorney's office had ever pursued that with a woman who is writing checks his friends family rappers\n[laughter] what part of the nine hundred dollar let's pick up on that list the next segment with strippers corrupt law Kim\nFlew early early up when I began to God and Julie in three to an incredible great back in the commercial break stay with us [noise]\nTrue story this just happened not long ago she showed up for a meal at St Vincent Paul's main dining room a Thirteen year old girl living with her family in a park somewhere nearby after she ate she came over to the dreams that are right next to the dining room turns out she needed more than a meal she needed to voice a dream\nShe wanted to sing her song for us so we showed up\nThe staff interns and volunteers we said please thing she did it was beautiful she's saying we listened she finished we applauded she smiled a dream fulfilled she felt great she had a good day\nWe had a great day making dreams come true joined us at the dream center where dreams get nurtured at St Vincent DePaul amazing things happen when you show up contact us at six o two to six six H.

lot of people don't understand that just of the peace or actually elected or not appointed\nSo most people first interaction with the justice system it's when you get a traffic ticket or something of that nature they're justice court are more community courts\nThey deal with misdemeanor small claims up to ten thousand dollars landlord tenant so it's a lot of things that regular people deal with everyday versus murder trials or something like that\nOkay I'm\nYou know I worked in the courts back in Detroit for ten years and I can tell you one thing that I Know about the courts people are terrified of them you know they they don't know what to expect it's like a mystical dungeons and dragons world that they come into\nAnd uh hopefully some of our justice of the peace accords are not like that and that in fact this is this is a community a government service for our citizens and ah\nMore of community courts they deal with misdemeanor small claims up to ten thousand dollars

other people well\nI've actually always been a survey of the people up for Twenty years now I've been educating families on their rights and responsibilities under the law I recently I the last

it's our government and uh and\nWelcome back friends welcome back to voice of democracy Arizona on independent talk radio ... eleven hundred a um are called the number six so to to seven Seventy five three six nine I Am so pleased that we have a couple of ladies here who are running for\nThe a justice of the Peace Corps who are going to make the courts people friendly again\nAnd ah and frankly we got to figure out the wage to make the whole criminal justice system people friendly again because no nobody should look at our government or any branch of our government is being against us\nAnd unfortunately there were some politicians who started that nonsense back like during the Reagan days my God was that you know anyway um this is nonsense it's our government and uh and frankly I'd like to um\nI'd like to find out once you're in court\nAre you going to go out to the community groups in and talk to them a little bit about what the court those and how they can navigate through that system\nI'm really glad that you mentioned that because again the education paid pieces huge um so that's one of the things I'm committed to actually said on the board of the major garden outlets in on the board of the major circles society involved in a lot of things going on in Mesa\nSo I don't see it as a new thing that I'm doing is just an extension of the work I've been doing and bringing people together in those neighborhoods not just the wealthy neighborhood\nBecause most of the people who are coming into the car or are working families right work you know\nOver where I live and we're all just trying to get by most Americans sixty three percent\nAre five hundred dollars away from bankruptcy while yeah although we we really have to make sure that people are educated because if they're not things fall through the cracks and I've talked to a lot of people out knocking doors I've talked to so many felons who have served their time that I really wish somebody had told me\nWhat I could have done to make this a better outcome Sharon yes\nSir X. no sir [laughter]\nSome southern route I hear you [laughter] well ah athletes get said I'm already rooted in the community as a landlord tenant counter I educate the public and I'd survived a several committees as well uh P. T. O. or the hiring a board\nAh for the superintendent and parents and so I I'm already rooted in the community and educating folks\nBut um some of the things that I've been doing lately it's educating a different route populations for instance I was just said GT you speaking to their psychology\nA student's I'll be at issue speaking to their social work student so um it's just something I've always done I'd love to educate folks and because knowledge in education that's power\nSo I won't be changing anything either that's what I Do um in some of the things I've done in the past for instance if at some of the ... schools I've it sits in in bringing up a cultural diversity programs to the schools and the way of we have a cultural diversity career day\nWhere you have African American pilots surgeon than judges at the school so that folks will see that there are if not just African American I Apologize but Latinos Native Americans we have a wide variety of a population so that's what I've been doing and I don't foresee me changing in any way\nUm and what I've done for Fifteen Years it's educate the public on their rights under landlord and had IT law prior to them going to court\nIf they don't like what the judge says and they come back and I'll educate them on whether they can file apps were dismissal or to set aside so it's just ingrained in me to be working in the community and educating folks whoa\nWhat I Do um in some of the things I've done in the past for instance if at some of the ... schools I Would sit in bringing up a cultural diversity programs to the schools and the way of we have a cultural diversity career day\nWhere you have African American pilots surgeon than judges at the school so that folks will see that there are if not just African American I Apologize but Latinos Native Americans we have a wide variety of a population so that's what I've been doing and I don't foresee me changing in any way\nUm and what I've done for Fifteen Years it's educate the public on their rights under landlord and had IT law prior to them going to court\nIf they don't like what the judge says and they come back and I'll educate them on whether they can file apps were dismissal or to set aside so it's just ingrained in me to be working in the community and educating folks\nWell oh go ahead I Am so glad that you mentioned working in schools because I actually work and in school and the third grade teacher I don't even think about it because this is my life uh\nI actually had a representative of the NFL and then come in and speak to my kids because they weren't able to go to Capitol for their field trip right there red Fred Rhone hats so yeah it's super important that kids are involved especially at such a young age because you know you don't want to grow up and be twenty and find yourself in court and not know what to do\nWhat I and I think so critically important as we do those children need to learn\nThe the potential consequences of anything stupid that they might do I remember one of the best things I enjoyed more than anything else was being a guest teacher\nYou know in school and my daughter's used to take advantage of me all the time 'cause they said well you know my my classroom friends need to find out that being a politician is not a terrible thing you know um but I I just think\nThat teaching our kids you know don't show off when you're driving your car that's no none of get you in deep trouble\nDon't be playing around with your cell phone when you're driving your car you know little things oh well I'm not even going to go there because none of my kids never drank or [laughter] or did drugs but the average and all of those things are important\nUm I\nI really really think that we have a great opportunity and a job to job in front of us and that is to educate the citizens\nThe government's not against you the courts are not against you you know if you come into the courtroom and you need help will talk to you you don't have to hire an attorney that charges you three hundred dollars an hour you know there there's a lot of things that the uh justice chords can do\nAnd I think it's fantastic to have a judges are coming out of the grassroots communities the beyond those courtrooms\nYes Michael is a when someone comes into my a courtroom I Hope that they'll so I have a sigh of relief when they see me or see my name because they will say I know how judge told\nCandidate judge solves oh we'll make a ruling she does not care what my last name as she does not care what the color of my skin it she will always judge on the rule of law and I want that for our society our community here in Maricopa County that's how it should be yeah and I want them to know that\nOne of the great thing about running for us to the piece is that the laws and a lot of the day no there's no laughter right it's not about partisan politics um and people are sick of that people the people there don't are very independent and they want somebody who's going to listen to them and really care about what they're saying\nBut there are a diversion programs and not everybody has to pay a fine you know lately and uh sometimes the fine is working\nSomeone comes into my a courtroom I Hope that they'll so I have a sigh of relief when they see me or see my name because they will say I know how judge told\nCandidate judge solves a will make a ruling she does not care what my last name is she does not care what the color of my skin it she will always judge on the rule of law and I want that for our society our community here in Maricopa County that's how it should be yeah and I want them to know that\nOne of the great thing about running for us to the piece is that the law says a lot of the day no there's no laughter right it's not about parts of politics um and people are thinking that people the people there don't are very independent and they want somebody who's going to listen to them and really care about what they're saying\nBut there are a diversion programs and not everybody has to pay a fine you know ... and ah sometimes to find his work in your community or ... and those kinds of things very quickly tell our listeners how they can help you\nWell of course donations are very very important because we're low ballot candidates a lot of folks don't realize that they can donate no matter where they live I think it's important for families didn't folks to know that you can live in Tucson [noise] and you can feel it it starts and then we still affect your life\nYou can travel from Tucson to my area which is heavy Guadalupe analogy you get a speeding ticket you'll be in my court and if you have a rental property live and pay them but the properties that are two key if you're a victim someone you'll be in my court so makes you share that with family or friends who live in our areas that were running\nA donation and at this the last two weeks when you can still volunteer time at\nThe most share that we are running so that will get the word out share with Sharon yet here about a year and a half okay so do you have like a Facebook page or something ... yes it solves her justice other pieces my Facebook page and solve project justice dot com it's my Web page\nOkay and as a Sears for justice\nYeah everything's every social media handle Instagram Twitter Facebook is that here's for that is I also have a website fears productive donations that are very simple I made it shares for justice dot com slash donate end\nIf you have to do any type of voter registration stuff of course we're past a deadline but for the future you can go to the IRS for justice dot com slash vote okay\nA very quickly uh one last thing that I Want to ask you is if a person is before you get into these places and in turn them into the kind of institutions they should be if a person gets in trouble and can't afford an attorney is there a phone number that they can call\nTo maybe a you know get some assistance at a low price or possibly you know grab as\nWell let me start by saying that there is a good resource has called for one one it's a social service resource where no matter what the issue is where it's homelessness jobs\nWick whatever you can call them they can give you information community legal services is an awesome resource you you are required to be a citizen be indigent and they will represent you if you're being evicted\nYou have my alma mater a issue Sandra Day O'Connor school ... ... the second or third year law students can provide legal advice\nAnd there are other agencies out there like legal shield mate who may uh allow you to have a membership of provide services\nBut as a landlord tenant counter I have to be honest with you there are not a lot of attorneys out there who will exist for instance Kenneth when it comes to ... because it can't afford that the cost of an inch attorney or a picture so there's a lot of research you may have to do\nOkay well I Wish both of you success because that means success for our communities and um once you're elected\nCall them they can give you information community legal services is an awesome resource you you are required to be a citizen then be indigent and they will represent you if you're being evicted\nYou have my alma mater a ASU Sandra Day O'Connor schools ... the second or third year law students can provide legal advice\nAnd there are other agencies out there like legal shield may who may uh allow you to have a membership it for five services but at the landlord tenant counter I have to be honest with you there are not a lot of attorneys\nOut there who will exist for instance can add when it comes to ... and it can't afford that the cost of an inch attorney ... so there's a lot of research you may have to do\nOkay well I Wish both of you success because that means success for our communities and um once you're elected you know hopefully we'll be able to celebrate\nYou know a new direction where the way people perceive our courts and our institutions you know and then we can work on on the whole or\nThe agency [noise] yeah because he has a a ruling was that these women didn't have rights\nTo determine their own a reproductive health so\nHow pro life is that it really paints a picture of a guy who just doesn't believe that women should control their own destiny and this is actually more common than you think recall how Russell Pearce former state Senate president was caught I think on the radio talking about how we should bring back sterilization\nOf certain types of people now that doesn't sound really pro life does it [laughter] and when you when you understand how this this movement operates you understand that it has never had anything to do with saving babies'\nOr family values or anything like that it it's always been about controlling women right punishing us for making your own decisions\nSo what can happen in Arizona and the next year [noise]\nUm you can expect they're going to be some more restrictions on abortion and if something happens with roe v Wade the law that's on a book looking back to that is it's one to five years in jail\nFor a woman for an abortion attempting to get an abortion or actually set in the law miscarriage so per hearing a miscarriage by a by taking something an operation or by any means\nSo think about someone who's like a Seventeen year old girl could maybe maybe have the drug problem or ...\nYeah I was gonna say would that be like and when it comes naturally pain and if I hadn't happened women have miscarriages all the time and\nThere's no way often to discern if the miscarriages a so called spontaneous one we're just occurred naturally or if\nHappen in Arizona and the next year [noise] um you can expect they're going to be some more restrictions on abortion and if something happens with roe v Wade the law that's on a book with the fact that that is it's one of five years in jail\nFor a woman for an abortion attempting to get an abortion or actually set in the law miscarriage so per hearing a miscarriage\nBy a by taking something an operation or by any means\nMm So think about someone who's like a Seventeen year old girl could maybe maybe have the drug problem or ... yeah I was going to say it would that be like and when it comes naturally pain and if I hadn't happened women have miscarriage hits all the time and there's no way often to discern if\nThe miscarriages a so called spontaneous one we're just occurred naturally or if you take a the most abortion pills right it it it creates a miscarriage and its indistinguishable by the time you get to the emergency room it's not in your bloodstream anymore it doesn't stay in there so they can't\nThey can't find that you took it and I'm I'm Talking about let's say there's a way on on abortion\nAnd you're at Seventeen year old Latina with maybe a a substance abuse problem and you show up at the hospital and somebody at a hospital there it's like an anti abortion person who thinks that you must have taken something to enter pregnancy\nAnd you think well they have the right I mean well sure she does but they'll call the cops\nThe county attorney could refer a criminal complaint I Hope she can get a good a defense attorney public defender to help her\nAnd I mean this girl could sit in jail this is happening in other states who have plates you know they've done twenty week band or so called me to protect them on what's happening is it's poor marginalized women\nAre already being prosecuted for things like miscarriages instill birth in Tennessee\nAbout a year ago there was a woman who worked at Amazon and Tennessee has restricted abortion so much that they only have like a couple of clinics in that state now so that's one that works at Amazon and you know they were really long hours and they don't have a lot protections they don't get paid a lot and she probably didn't have a health care coverage\nShe tried to give herself an abortion with a knitting needle oh to get two thousand Fifteen million ... or something like that and she spent a year in jail\nThey finally if she got some good legal aid to help her and I think they actually ended up by overturning the ... the conviction or whatever but she went to jail coat hanger abortion so nobody can tell you can look that up Tennessee Woman goes to jail for coat hanger abortion it's real and on a noble and telling me this won't happen\nOne thing I Want to know is where do these fanatics get from the Bible the fact\nThat quote or you can't have an abortion 'cause the Bible says you can and where do they get from the Bible when does the fetus become actually a child there's nowhere\nYour ... and and and Jewish people will tell you I mean if you're a strict observing a lake worth ... Jew a it's it's something like\nThe woman has the option to terminate a pregnancy up until that the child is practically born that their religious teaching obviously I grew up Catholic different teaching entirely I think people interpreted differently I Will hear\nUm you're probably more familiar with us an idea there's a there's a passage in the Bible about how I needed you in the in the womb mhm and depending on which version it is and there's a couple of ... other passengers they like to throw out but if they're kind of cherry picked and not in contact and\nBecause there's a lot of other stuff in the Bible that's not particularly baby friendly no you're [laughter] like little drowning baby in a you know seriously I view\nWhen does the fetus become actually a child there's nowhere\nIn ... and and and Jewish people will tell you I mean if you're a strict observant are like ... ah it's it's something like\nThe woman had the option to terminate a pregnancy up until that the child is practically born that's their religious teaching I obviously I grew up Catholic different teaching entirely I think people interpreted differently I Will hear\nUm you're probably more familiar with it is an idea there's a passage in the Bible about how I needed you in the in the womb mhm and depending on which version of that and there's a couple of ... other passengers they like to throw out but if they are kind of cherry pick in not in contact and\nBring up because there's a lot of other stuff in the Bible that's not particularly baby friendly no you or anything like the loop drowning baby and I you know seriously have you read some of the older testament stuff they weren't really nice to babies and children of like their political enemies and things\nAnd you know all you know what another thing too is the fact that you have a lot of women who are running for office on the Republican ticket and none of them none of them are saying we will protect a woman's right to choose\nOne and it's not I mean I I Want to be fair because it's not just the one that 'cause sometimes they go after Republican women harder like oh as a woman you should be more or whatever but I mean\nThe men are worse there were there were there really are because it's the men who really a lot of times you'll hear like the real violence mhm rhetoric I mean there ... there was a candidate in Idaho running for\nState legislature or something and he a couple of times what on record saying that say you should have a death penalty\nFor Donna hold that point we got to take a break we'll get right back to you and we're going to get back to the other issue which is vitally important to poke too you're listening to voice of democracy Arizona on independent talk radio KF ... eleven hundred
