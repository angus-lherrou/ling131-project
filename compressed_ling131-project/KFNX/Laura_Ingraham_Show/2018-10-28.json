side of the trade the right side of the rate is brought to buy online training academy Phoenix\nCelebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trainer education while we just got back from our annual conference they're literally hundreds and hundreds of people who work with online training academy all over the world\nAnd it's always great to kind of once you everybody gets together and\nYou see a lot of old friends meet some new ones that whole thing but\nThat is not why you tuned in to the show\nBut it it's actually it's a very exciting time for us and and in Phoenix particularly we're excited about a number of things a number of our staff WON Awards as being best in the world are operations manager Mary green one at the best operations manager in the world\nThose of you who are students I Know a will certainly respect that married finally got that at well ward and got her do as someone who is just under a great job with helping with students and making sure that we always have a very smoothly running operation\nBut also at the center once again we want what's called the branch camping award\nAnd there's a word has only been given three times and we have one at all three times\nAnd and then to me it's the most important to the words that are given out because of what it's about is we're the people that do the best job of representing the ideals of the company and the ideals of the company are all about didn't success and we really do it online trade economy Phoenix try to focus on the students' first\nAnd and the philosophy I always try to impart to people it's students center itself and the first thing that we have to do is focused on doing the right thing for the student then it's kind of we got to keep the lights on what do we do for the center and only at the end we really worried about the individual achievements and accolades\nAnd that is served as very well actually this week will be the the eighth year that I have owned the center there\nAnd uh we've come a long way and it is due to you\nOnce again we want what's called the branch camping award\nAnd there's a word has only been given three times and we have one at all three times and to me it's the most important in the words that are given out because of what it's about is we're the people that do the best job of representing the ideals of the company and the ideals of the companies are all about didn't six out\nAnd we really do it online trade economy Phoenix try to focus on the students' first\nAnd and the philosophy I've always tried to impart to people it's students center itself and the first thing that we have to do is focus on doing the right thing for the student then it's kind of we got to keep the lights on what do we do for the center and only at the end we really worried about kind of the individual achievements and accolades\nAnd that is served as very well actually this week will be the the eighth year that I have owned the center there\nAnd uh we've come a long way and it is to do you guys are students listeners and all the elder staff to just work so hard and so again I just wanted to kind of a shout out to everybody or on the staffer for just all the hard work but also\nIt made me think about what is it that we do I think maybe differently than anybody else out there in the industry that makes it so successful and I will tell you if you look at overall reviews for online trading academy\nWhen students do their surveys after their their you know enroll in classes and what not what you find out that for all the online trading academies worldwide\nBut it's essentially because the people who win this with the people who do the best job of representing the values of the company and the values of the company are all about focusing on students' success and we work really really hard at it and it made me think about\nWhat is it that kind of we do I think well being supporting our students which took me to an even bigger question which was what is it really take to be successful in the market and talked about in the first segment the first thing you have to understand is what the market's really are which is totally different than what has been sold to us\nThey're not discounting mechanisms of future cash flow you cannot study a company's conference calls and know which companies are going to win and lose because first of all you're never going to know more than Goldman Sachs and city group and the people that run the companies\nThere's always going to be able to have an informational advantage so why should we try to compete where we have a week and that's\nThe second part of it is is that the things that make a company successful change over time it's not just about the technology is devoted to raise money the ability to market the building itself it's about out about sourcing and logistics it's about corporate costs\nSupporting our students which took me to an even bigger question which was what is it really take to be successful in the market and talked about in the first segment the first thing you have to understand is what the market's really are which is totally different than what has been sold to us\nThey're not this kind of mechanisms of future cash flow you cannot study a company's conference calls and know which companies are going to win and lose because first of all you're never going to know more than Goldman Sachs in city group and the people that run the companies\nThere's always going to be able to have an informational advantage so why should we try to compete where we have a weakness\nThe second part of it is is that the things that make a company successful change over time it's not just about the technology is devoted to raise money the ability to market the ability to sell its about out about sourcing and logistics it's about corporate culture throughout leadership it's about competitive er spawn\nAll things that change overtime now one of the difficulties is that the market's done nothing but go up potentially for nine years although maybe seen some change in that right now but when the market's going up every strategy works\nYou know back in the nineties used to always talk about never confused genius with a bull market and I think there's a lot of risk and that today as well everybody that's been buying stocks and you know most people aren't doing great but they're doing kind of okay\nNow they have no real plan for what to do when the market goes down and\nThat's like one of the really key pieces of information how do you not just survive when the market goes down but how do you thrive how do you develop a mindset to where you look forward to the opportunity of the market going down\nA conference one of the people I was talking to John O'Donnell is one of the founders of online trading academies are chief knowledge officer and I said so how do you do and he said just waiting for the crash so I can be short [laughter] okay [laughter]\nAnd that's how we view this and it's not that\nWe do we ... we wish harm to other people in the market to go down but we know the market's going to go down at some point and again you're starting to see some real weakness in rocky and his and\nMaybe this continues and maybe it's a reflection of interest rate and maybe as people worried about what happens after the election or any of thirty other things we've talked about on the show over the years\nBut there's a lot of things out there that one day have to come home to roost what we want to do is not to read that but just realize it's a fact of life\nAnd we want to be able to be successful when that happens we don't want to hope that we we you know we lose a bunch of money and then somehow over time we get it to come back\nThis the individual stocks almost never come back indexes come back because they're not the same stock and this is something else that most people don't really understand about the market\nThey look at you know the Dow Jones industrial average in first they don't generally understand it's only thirty stocks and it's not really representative of of the market but okay fine\nBut then they think that it's kind of always the same stocks but it's not the stocks in the index is get changed out regularly which means that companies that go bankrupt to perform poorly\nThey go away and new socks come in so it's a marketing tool and it gets back to the market is marketing it's people trying to convince you that this stock will get your clothes wider than white that\nThis stock will make you more appealing to the opposite sex or whatever it may be and and I'm Serious that's what this is\nWhat happens is institutions buying stocks at low prices and this happens on the intra day basis and it happens on a very long term basis\nBut they buy the stocks when they're cheap they didn't tell you how wonderful they are they do other things as well to drive the price of the stocks up and then they sell them to you would have high price and lo and behold like any retail industry they make money because what they're doing is buying something and selling it for more\nThe retail trade or loses because they buy too late in the cycle and they don't\nThey go away and new socks come in so it's a marketing tool and it gets back to the market is marketing it's people trying to convince you that this stock will get your clothes wider than white that\nThis stock will make you more appealing to the opposite sex or whatever it may be and and I'm Serious that's what this is\nWhat happens is institutions buy stocks at low prices and this happens on the intra day basis and it happens on a very long term basis\nBut they buy the stocks when they're cheap they didn't tell you how wonderful they are they do other things as well to drive the prices to be stocked up and then they sell them to you what a high price and lo and behold like any retail industry they make money because what they're doing is buying something and selling it for more\nThe retail trade or loses because they buy too late in the cycle and they don't know how to make money when it goes down and they don't how to know how to recognize the signs\nThat the market is changing direction and again we're seeing some signs right now that we may be starting that process\nIf you look at what's happening in Asia stocks are getting whack pretty hard most of the Asian indexes are down at least ten percent so far this month some of them are down think China's down about thirty percent this year okay and this is the other thing we got that people don't fully grasp is\nThe market moves very very quickly to the down side and I'm explaining why this is in class and wives faster the downside than the upside but when the market's moving to the downside people don't have time to react as we've talked about on the show here before when the market plunged in two thousand and eight\nPrices for the ... five hundred went back to Nineteen Ninety six levels\nThe market literally gave back Thirteen Years of profits in a year and a half and people were totally blindsided by it but that money didn't disappear someone made that money somebody's sold before it went down some people did what's called ghost short which allows them to make money on those falls\nThis idea that the market crates and destroys wealth is wrong\nThere is an illusion of wealth creation there's an illusion of wealth destruction and explain to you how you see past that I mean really when you come to the half day class it's and I don't remember which one gets the red pills that you take the matrix whatever color pill you take that allows you to see the reality of life\nThat's what happens when you come to the half day class now the problem is that you can't go back okay can't be like Joe pounds Antoni or whatever his name is and then be able to go out and eat steak because you're just beaten up but just for if you've seen the matrix\nBut if you want to come out to class and really understand how you can succeed in the market\nYou can get to free tickets and a free tablet by being one of the

A. as in online training academy two three one nine nine sick\nIf you win tickets please registers we know you're coming otherwise we may have a seat for you we may not have your tablet may have your lunch\nAnd chaos ensues and we would like to get whatever Roswell so coming back to this\nThe the three main pillars of understanding how to make money in this market is understand that this is a game of probability is never a game of certainty but we can get the highest possible probability if we know what to look for secondly\nThe times that we're wrong we're going to randomly be wrong if we knew we were going to be wrong we wouldn't get into the trade so how do we minimize our losses those times were wrong\nThen how do we make our money work as hard for us as possible when you buy stock you generally have to put up at least half the money so if you buy a hundred dollar stock you have to put up you know fifty bucks in some cases you may only have to put up twenty five percent of the money but there are some rules to that\nIf you trade something white currency she put up two percent of the money so if you want to trade a thousand dollars of a currency you literally put up twenty dollars and you can do trades where you literally put up twenty dollars\nAnd by the way when you trade something like currencies you're not dealing with things like stock through an all time highs\nWhere it's very difficult to know you know what a way where were the top in this market so so with currencies are wanted these currencies are just kind of middle of the pack right now and you can make money on these very quickly in both directions as well\nSo we want to understand what the right instrument is for us to be invested in trading in\nAnd understand again this probability risk manager and meant and using the leverage to make our money worked for us again harder than we worked for it so again these are all the kinds of ideas that we teach in our classes it's what I'm going to do if you come out to the half day classes well\nNow the next set of skills that we really want to think about it\nPeople you know think about well you know this is so specialized I'm just going to let my adviser handled this with all due respect there's some people out there that are advisors that are good people trying to do the right thing but the reality is that the vast majority of them are simply commission sales people they are drug reps masquerading as doctors they\nAre selling you what will make them the most money not necessarily what is best for you\nThe reason they sell you a new release is that is the highest commission product that's out there okay you're paying in many cases eight eight and a half percent up front\nYou can't get your money out for years without a penalty you're giving up a huge percentage in some cases maybe over Ninety percent of the profits that are making on your money and you're taking the risk how does that make any sense okay\nWhen they're selling you stocks are selling you I mean these big banks literally have meetings on Monday Mornings or every morning and they tell\nSome people out there that advisors that are good people trying to do the right thing\nBut the reality is that the vast majority of them are simply commission sales people they are drug reps masquerading as doctors they are selling you what will make them the most money not necessarily what is best for you\nThe reason they sell you a new release is that is the highest commission product that's out there okay you're paying in many cases eight eight and a half percent up front\nYou can't get your money out for years without a penalty you're giving up a huge percentage in some cases maybe over Ninety percent of the profits that are making on your money and you're taking the risk how does that make any sense okay\nWhen they're selling you stocks are selling you I mean these big banks literally have meetings on Monday Mornings or every morning and they tell their people here's what we're going to sell today\nAnd how is it that that is in your best interests to have those people making decisions with your money and and one of the things I always try to get across to people would look\nEverybody's looking out for themselves okay you and your advisors aren't bad people but they've got to feed their kids to and so when it comes down to what's best for you and what's best for them part of what's best for them as what he is the most commission part of what's best for them is what can keep their boss off their back\nYou know and by the way you know when the market's going down and one of the reasons people take these big losses in the advisors always tell them hey you know don't sell now why did they tell you not to sell they tell you it's because the stock to always come back\nBut understand stock themselves don't generally come back\nWith indexes comeback it can take Fifteen or Twenty years why would you give up half of your invest in life potential 'cause most people thirty five or forty years give up half of it hoping to break even how was that as your best interest\nThe reason they tell you that you said as long as you own stocks you won't take your money out of the account and they can keep generating fees the minute you go to cash you might take your money out that's why they really tell you to do that\nBut the unfortunate reality is there's nothing in that decision process that comes down to hey well what's best for for Joe bag a donut through my client it's what's my boss smart way to sell or need me to sell what's paying the best bonus this month how do I get the highest commission\nAnd again it gets back to me to this to rational approaches to the market\nEither learn how to do this yourself and do it right or stay out there is no law that says you have to put your hard earned money at risk and the market but if you're going to do it do it as an informed investor or trader and again one of the things that a lot of people would become students are at online training academy\nIt's just to even know the questions to ask so they don't feel so intimidated by the advisor so again if you want to understand how this stuff works and just to understand questions to ask her advisor\nBe one of the next dozen calls you can get to free tickets and a free tablet which to free tickets to half the

right side of the trade the right side of the trade is brought to buy online training academy Phoenix\nCelebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education for the first three segments we've been talking about what it takes from kind of knowledge perspective to succeed in the market and by the way if you ever miss any of the show\nA lot of the stations that carry us have pod cast you can go check it out there and if you missed part of a show or all of a show you will be set\nBut at the very beginning I talked about we've just won the award for the third time in a row for the what's called the brand champion awarded online training academy for the campus of the forty three campuses that\nDoes the best job of representing the values of of the brand which are about students' success now here's the thing we all teach the same thing okay the knowledge itself and by the way we have a patent on what we teach nobody else teachers that are approaching are scoring system and how we do what we do\nPatton was issued about four and a half years ago at this point but it's it's a\nAn approach to the market that has been tried and true to have been doing

show everyone and happy\nLabor Day weekend is Labor Day weekend for everybody to have a good time and be safe that's all this important but it's still hot and we still have solar Sandy it's here in Studio welcome back to the show tell me about it you were on a mission you've been on a mission since I met you tell everybody wire here so much\nWhy am I hear so much 'cause everybody has a lot to fill everybody has the power bill that we all\nWe are all very frustrated especially this summer I'm seeing so many people that have called me listening to our show Carol\nI'm and I'm On different radio shows as well and my whole mission is because of my daughter five years ago\n[noise] um that I wasn't able to help my own daughter pay her power bill due to an accident and then I had many years ago I myself was on a fixed income Social Security disability and when she reached out to me and said mom I really need help with my ...\nI said well honey I really can't help you that much with your part built but by the way how much does it\nAnd when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident and I said ... you have a little tiny house how could your purview however build these so high\nI sit there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and ... and the therapy because atheists and that's where people had some dues or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake cutting look let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nUm I use the analogy there's lots of people out there that can make hamburgers okay I'm up at these things but there's only one that has the secret sauce now\nSecret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management and let me talk about that with the owner built this thing called demanded a lot of people an ape you this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe ... team point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange numbers usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power from last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between\nThat has a secret sauce now\nSecret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management and let me talk about that we see on our bills this thing called demand and a lot of people an atheist this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called the man and it's a number of like maybe ... team point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just day regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hottest I'm of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\n... there's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all and and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it\nSo the smart energy management the way to the analogy that people like that I've been told is remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line\nTo call long distance Monday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay at a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist don't matter when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWife's consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing in the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when the hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're killing off our a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you've consumed at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty four cents that demand church is more than the cost of your kill all walk on that particular rape time it is to me and I do get wound up above this and I get very upset about it is\nHere for its criminal\nUm I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power\nJust not charge so if you're killing off our hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you've consumed at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty four cents that demand church is more than the cost of your kill all walk on that particular rape time it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... ... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay younger ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it it's a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS and as you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you anymore so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on that it's going to continue to go up\nAnd now I've walked in my own power rate from my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that\nIt's actually a refund to them and I explain all this to them so not only are you paying between seven and half a neat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying two words the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living more comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to go up they are never going to stop where they're at um it it just it doesn't make sense for them\nThey can you bring your rates everybody should just call you just find out how to read their bill and then I don't know how to read their ... and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if you go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people who will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site ... I Do a rate I'm review and break it down\nIt's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again\nAnd I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half\nAnd NATO's out there that no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right\nWere there at um it it just it doesn't make sense for them things those in Ukrainian rates\nEverybody should just call you just find out how to read their bill and they know how to read they're real and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if he'll go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people who will say that on my show\nAll the time and say I do a rate I'm review and break it down\nIt's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again\nAnd I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half and today they're out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go home now you understand what you're right and so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car\nAnd gas over here is five dollars a gallon and gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and pay two fifty and that's essentially Carol\nI'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS an assert these reports today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home we use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid to the power company cut that in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money\nWell here's what we're

conjunction with each other\nIt's scripture tells us that faith repentance baptism holiness hope love and war are part of what God desires of us then it's important that we understand not only how they work but how they work together\nWe are not free to pick and choose which one are ones that we like our which will honor ones that we will follow if we are to be God's Children if we are to be Christ followers and then we must be willing to submit to their will and believe and do what they have determined to be best for us\nDo the words believe and do mean that we earn redemption no never it does mean though that we are not just submitting to got through Christ but that we are also doing what Christ dead in his incarnate earthly steak\nJesus knew the will of the heavenly father and Jesus out of love and respect for the heavenly father Jesus obeyed his well\nThat's the principle that we find taught in John Fifteen versus nine and ten as a father loved me I also have loved you apply in my love\nIf you keep my commandments you wouldn't have bought in my love justice have kept my father's commandments and the ... in his love\nWhen Jesus expected of the apostles his audience in this context was to do what he that he is Jesus did\nWell what did Jesus do he kept the father's commandments and he remained in the father's love the parallel requirement for the apostles if you keep my commandments you will abide in my love\nThose Jesus expectations for the apostles in this setting applied only to the ... yes it applies to the apostles but no it does not apply only to the apostles\nJesus said something similar to the apostles and another passage in John's gospel in fact several of that\nAnd John fourteen Fifteen Jesus said if you love me keep my commandments in John fourteen Twenty one he who has my commandments and keeps them it is he loves me and he loves me will be ... by my father and I love him and manifest myself to him\nJohn fourteen twenty three Jesus

of God is perfect in him by this we know that we are in him he who says he a barge and him himself also to walk just as he walked and then finally checking John Bursch six\nThis love that we walk according to his command much this is the commitment that as you've heard from the beginning you should walk in at\nThe initial tax that we noted in the gospel of John those in John fourteen and John Fifteen or said directly to the apostles the wording often included others as well he who has my commitments and keeps them\nIn John fourteen Twenty one was not just referencing a the who happened to be an apostle\nAnd John fourteen twenty three Jesus said if anyone loves me he will keep my word anyone does not mean anyone who just happens to be an apostle and all the passages sided from Johns letters include others not just the apostles\nThe message when Jesus said about himself that he kept the fathers well and that he remained in the father's love because he did so certainly applied to the apostles but as we just noted\nIt applies to all who would believe and who would love the lord that means to me and that means you\nRomans five does not include every redemptive element mentioned

and I'm On different radio shows as well and my whole mission is because of my daughter\nFive years ago [noise] um that I wasn't able to help my own daughter pay her power bill due to an accident and then I had many years ago I myself was on a fixed income Social Security disability and when she reached out to me and said mom I really need help with my ...\nI said well honey I really can't help you that much with your ... but by the way how much does it\nAnd when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident and I said ... you have a little tiny house how could your purview however bill be so high\nI sit there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and ... and ... he has a business or people had some dues or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake ... let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nI said there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and our bills from a PS and a therapy because atheists and that's where people had some news or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake ... let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nSecret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management and let me talk about that would see on our built this thing called demand and a lot of people an atheist this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe Thirteen point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three ten\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hardest time of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\n... there's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that too right in them and and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it so the smart energy management the way that the analogy that people like that I've been told\nIs remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance Monday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay it a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would beat they were making money hand over fist don't matter when we called\nThere's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it so the smart energy management the way that the analogy of the people like like that I've been told\nIs remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance Monday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay it a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were known more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist no matter when we called made long distance phone calls [noise]\nWife's consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when it's hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for a home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept our thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're killing off our hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other one's votes open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay\nFor a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you any more so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's going to continue to go off\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them and I explain all this to them\nSo not only are you paying between seven and half and eat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying towards the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home\nYou any more so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's going to continue to go off\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them and I explain all this to them\nSo not only are you paying between seven and happening have sense for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying towards the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're listening more comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this\nThere's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus the electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um\n... it it just it doesn't make sense for them they can you raise everybody should just call you just to find out how to read\nTheir bill and then I don't know how to read their ... and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if you go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people who will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site and I do a rate I'm review and break it down\nIt's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again\nAnd I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing us for a year year and a half\nAnd today they're out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time and then they go home now I understand what she writes and so no\nJudgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simply this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and pay two fifty and that's essentially Carol I'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a P. S. S. or peace rate punch today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home will you between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid the power company cut that in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money\nHere's what we're going to do we want to keep out your phone number because everyone really should just give her a call she does a free consultation she's raised with the better Business Bureau I just found out at that out and uh her phone number direct it is six to three eight five\nYou're going to go over here and pay two fifty and that's essentially Carol I'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS Messer petri puns today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home will use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid for the power company\nCut in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money\nWell here's what we're gonna do we want to give out your phone number because everyone really should just give her a call she does a free consultation she's ready to what the better Business Bureau I just found out at that out and uh her phone number direct it is six to three\nEight five zero eight two two nine she wants you to go up on her website it is ask solar Sandy dot com go to ask make sure it's ... dot com\nFill out the kilowatt worksheet and she can help you save money on a bill that you're already paying way too much money on what are your final words for today you know\nIt it's the simplest is you know I really am on a mission and when I helped my daughter it was the first time in a long time due to my circumstances that I was able to do\nSomething really significant in her life because I financially wasn't able to help her but I saw the really big problem for her and it gave me\nA self accomplishment in it she was so ever so grateful\nThan she shared it with her neighbors and a lot of her neighbors did it because the than I was able to help them understand that my daughter was able to help them understand it\nSo now it's about I'm there to educate\nAnd give people the the information so that they can make an informed decision about their own power costs they wouldn't let somebody else choose their host what kind of payment they could afford for mortgage they wouldn't let somebody ... ... how much they could afford for car why would people\nUntil maybe they just haven't got the information yeah\nBut let's get Hugh Hugh with the right information you can make an informed decision about your power cause she's valley wide it said no obligation free consultation to you out there she had lots of incentives to that she offers to everyone\nThe number to call her direct it is area code six to three eight five zero eight two two nine go on that website and check out the ... ... feet it's asked sell solar Sandy dot com [noise]\nYes it's a joint exit daisy dot com um and it's ...\nYes it's a joint exit daisy dot com\nUm and it's just like it sounds J.

part of what you do you got to listen to this this is also incredible they're waiting for that real estate agents out\nThere exactly um the sponsoring that we do is as it is a by invite only company ah so you can't just join our company just by going online saying hey or were signing up with you\nYou have to be invited by somebody that person or once you get hired or if if you were hired I'm that person then becomes your sponsor because anybody you into the company\nOr just a couple of things I'm a the sponsor will make ten percent of the ah a residual off of the agent that they'd sponsor up to ten thousand dollars per year per agent um\nAnd that's good because exit is just a helping people or helping the agent um financially by helping us grow\n'em and that money does come directly from corporate it does it come from the brokerage or anything else or has nothing to do with any profit sharing doesn't having to do with multi level marketing none of that stuff it's just that hey you invite somebody has a company we thank you by paying you up to ... percent of their ... of of their gross income up to ten thousand dollars per year\nAnd we'll go ahead no I'm well what I wanted to ask you when you when you see people that want to call in and say what I'd like to work with you so does it start off with an interview with you guys ... and then you kinda taken to the next level or how does it work we\nCall them and we do a confidential interviews some of the interviews last twenty minutes depending on if we kind of get that feeling they're a good person and probably make a good fit some people I think our longest one was like three and a half hours so [laughter] and then\nThey have a lot of questions and we take the time to make sure that all the questions were answered um were available ... most of the time um I mean sometimes we do have appointments where we don't interrupt but\nUm we we feel that we need to be acceptable to anybody and if you have a question about whether it's about our brand or any other brand or even how to get into the business give us a call will be happy to help\nDoesn't matter if they've already had some experience\nNo does not know um and we understand\nA lot of our agents that do come on board with it um do have some experience and that is the main problem um they've got experience and they understand that this is not an easy business to be in and um you can be thrown out into the big blue ocean all by yourself and\nJust try to survive and that's that that's that's a big thank God we started the same way we were just thrown into the deep end it's like okay go for it and it's like well what do we do well just go out and do this this and that it it that's not the ... this business as much tougher than that right

like well what do we do well just go out and do the system that\nIt it does not the ... this business has much tougher than that right yeah especially for people that have never owned a business before because when they get into when you get into real estate you're getting into your own business you're going to run your own company\nUm you have a broker there that you have to hang your license with an order steak complying with the state and the rules and regulations\nBut that broker is just there to provide you with some tools to ... to help you do your business better some brokers broke ridges and brokers are good at it some are not very good at it\nUm we've had our opportunity to hang our license with both kinds um we were lucky enough to find one that actually taught us how to do this business early on and that's what's led to survive as long as we have and has grown as much as we have so\nWell with exit the way I see it [noise] there's a lot of people out there that sale that get involved with them and they say well all mentor your and they'll have somebody that might do that right but this is the company that's actually really behind you yes big time with these
