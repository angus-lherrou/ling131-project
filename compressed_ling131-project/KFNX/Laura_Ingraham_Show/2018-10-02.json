[noise]\nIt was it was wild it was fun it was a it was a fun time and kind of a reward for my people working so hard to get some are important tree done\nSo it probably doesn't surprise you that the wall Street Journal today is like on cue their lead editorial a a new NAFTA relief is the title and the new deal is worse than the status quo\nBut disaster was avoided um and it's very specific criticisms but uh your your reaction to the naysayers who are out there saying that well you stripping protections against predatory government behavior for most foreign investors\nOr the new deal also take the giant step toward politically managed trade by imposing new rules of origin labor rags\nI let you tee off on a couple of those\nWell I mean I don't want to specifically focus on the wall Street Journal they've been sort of against the idea of changing after from the beginning you have to start with the with the\nThe position was NAFTA in this current state good or bad well we have large deficits every everyone would agree it was it was twenty five years out of date I mean there was no Internet price we have cell phones the size of hats\nWhen this thing went into effect and people would suggest don't upgraded as crazy and then in addition to changes in the economy we are very large deficits and we were witnessing literally the loss of our of our automobile industry parts and companies\nAre to Mexico on to other places so the people who say we shouldn't have have um we shouldn't have renegotiated this thing or just you know engaging in self deception I might I might know that both\nThe secretary Clinton and President Obama both when they ran for president promised that would renegotiate it they just didn't do it in the final analysis but they both ignore\nTo start with the with the\nThe position was NAFTA in its current state good or bad well we have large deficits\nEvery everyone would agree it was it was twenty five years out of date I mean there was no Internet price we have cell phones the size of hats when this thing went into effect and people would suggest don't upgrade it is a crazy and then in addition to changes in the economy we had very large deficits\nAnd we were witnessing literally the loss of our of our automobile industry parts and companies are to Mexico and other places so the people who say we shouldn't have have um we shouldn't have renegotiated this thing or just that you know engaging in self deception I might I might know that both\nThe secretary Clinton and President Obama both when they ran for president\nPromised they would renegotiate it they just didn't do it in the final analysis but they both acknowledged that it needed to be arraigned done so what the president did which I which I think was terrific is we have we have by far the biggest trade bloc\nIn in history at one point two trillion dollars and we've not rewritten the rules in ways that are that are better quite frankly for all three countries particularly better for America that's who that's who pays my bills and do I care about\nAnd better in a whole variety of ways\nIt's the the auto rules of origin are extremely important in terms of making sure that manufacturing moved back to America and stays in America the there is a a sunset provision that there's going to make sure we review this on a periodic basis\nWe call it a review provision their labor rights which had never been like this ever in an agreement before there's access on agriculture there's there's a hole and then you move into the next step of things like digital trade and electrical property protection financial services all these\nThese ah twenty first century economy kinds of things there were no adequate rules and that we have um there's even very good rules are on the environment with your beyond anything we've negotiated before which I'm I'm proud of there's there's very\nStrong and enforceable rules on currency which we've never had an a trade agreement before there there are limitations on data local is Asian which is an important thing for the digital trade people we have limitations on how state owned enterprises which is you think China can subsidize so there's\nThere's a whole variety of things in various pockets of the extremely important to Graham it better than than anything in the states as having to go she had it before it's going to make a real difference for working men and women in this country now some businesses and some Wall Street guys all have to figure out another way to make a fortune\nBut in terms of working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's going to make a big difference and it's going to be this is the that the President Trump trade a prototype and we're going to use it going forward with countries around the world so it's really really an important day we're\nTalking about Lighthizer us trade rap or one of the chiefs of course negotiators and getting us to this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement I bought one of the things that were wondering how this works any still Republican majority Congress\nCould this mean what's the mechanism for this passing when there's there are some Republicans supporting it some probably won't but more Democrats would support than than Republicans correct\nWell I Would not say that I think you're going to find a Republicans and Democrats both supported uh hopefully strongly that there are a few Republicans who will probably oppose it because they don't like the fact that we're going to bring manufacturing back and they think that that uh\nOutsourcing is not a problem there are some Democrats little posted in in part because it's just something that\nUh one of the chiefs of course negotiators and getting us to this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement I bought one of the things that were wondering how this works any still Republican majority Congress\nCould this mean what's the mechanism for this passing where there's there are some Republicans supporting it some probably won't but more Democrats would support this than Republicans correct\nWell I Would not say that I think you're going to find a Republicans and Democrats both supported uh hopefully strongly there there are a few Republicans who will probably oppose it because they don't like the fact that we're going to bring manufacturing back and they think that that ah\nOutsourcing is not a problem there are some Democrats a little ... in part because it's just something that the president wants and they're against that or the thinking doesn't go far enough [noise]\nBut but I think uh the vast majority of fair minded members in both parties\nWill support this now one of the criticisms you have which is sort of an odd one in the wall Street Journal is they have this view that well\nWe never should've talked to labor unions and Democrats when we put it together and then they draw the conclusion that for that it's worse for us well if the Democrats should\nUh take over and of course the exact opposite is true\nWe we we designed this to be bipartisan for working men and women and farmers and ranchers is not something I I Believe it's going to end up being purely\nPartisan and if it is a kind of thing that can only be pass with Republican votes if that's what we had to go she added that I Would agree with the with the people who say it would have trouble passing but that's not how it was designed and it's not what we did\nThis is what I'm John Harwood CNBC than specifically regarding autos listen\nThere are some elements of manage trained in it that are less free that is to say the provisions for the auto industry if those provisions work means our cars will get more expensive for us consumers but there's also a chance that they are complicated enough\nThat they will be worth it for automakers to comply which means that the president's statement about a new dawn for the auto industry that is almost certainly not correct your\nI guess my I mean if I had to make one word it would be nonsense [noise] uh you wonder about people who make statements like that there there are so palpable crazy and you wonder what else there thing that is also crazy so just to give you an idea all\nThe ... the major auto companies\nGeneral Motors Ford F. ca was used to be Chrysler Honda and Toyota have all said this is fine they can work with this they've all said it's going to move more jobs back to America\nBut that's not a bad thing yeah that's a good thing they've all says workable they've all endorsed it so that the kind of people who don't know very much about what's going on and make those kind of wild statements\nI Would just take them to sit down and losing their belt and they're tired and breathe ten times and then just read something about it\nAnd they'll realize how they don't know what they're talking about this is going to be really very very important for um for American manufacturing it's going to bring a lot of jobs back\nWe at the end by the way it's not bad for for Mexico or for Canada either it'll it'll help them to\nThe biggest single thing we do let me just give you an idea what the biggest thing we do or what the two biggest things we do one is we increase the content of cars that are sold in America and Mexico and Canada but sold in America\nThat the the the content that is made in this region is increasing right now\nThe kind of people who don't know very much about what's going on and make those kind of wild statements I Would just take them to sit down and losing their belt and they're tired and breathe ten times and then just read something about it\nAnd they'll realize how they don't know what they're talking about this was going to be really very very important for um for American manufacturing it's going to bring a lot of jobs back\nWe at the end by the way it's not bad for for Mexico or for Canada either it'll it'll help them to\nThe biggest single thing we do let me just give you an idea what the biggest thing we do or what the two biggest things we do one is we increase the content of cars that are sold in America and Mexico and Canada but sold in America\nThat the the the content that is made in this region is increasing right now we say at sixty two percent and it's really more like about fifty because of loopholes and all this special interest stuff\nWe're going to raise it up to Seventy five percent how was that a bad thing\nUnder under the ... the person who's going to lose out on this is China\nIn places like that under the TPP that these people all endorsed half the car can be made in China and sold in American duty free it's completely lunacy the people don't know what they're talking about the other thing is we're requiring that a certain percent of the car [noise]\nBe made in a high wage area that is to say in America now it could be Canada also but in America for the most part\nThat's not a bad thing at all why shouldn't we say if we're going to give you the benefit of selling cars indoor market with no duties better than we treat anyone else in the world why shouldn't we say that a certain amount of those cars should be made in America by American labor\nNow I think what President Trump prominent on it's on the campaign trail he promised he delivered Bible Lighthizer USC are what's next I mean are you guys going to get a deal done with Europe some of the European countries ... deals with Switzerland or some of these other\nSmaller countries I Know they and Swiss they're anxious to do a deal with the guys I Know that first hand\nYeah no we have a variety of things that we're we're talking to the Japanese were talking to the Europeans [noise]\nWe have a lot of things that we're doing a small deals dot com singles doubles that people don't even know about we're talking I won't go through but there's a bunch of other countries do and then of course the big the big elephant in the room is China\nAnd one of the funny things I'll tell you there's one last time on the wall Street Journal editorial because you brought it up they kind of show a graph of the American S. and P. and then they mark certain things to sort of say oh look at this was bad for the U.S in the what they don't mark\nIs when when the president announced history has thrill one which was like in March since the market's gone straight up when the president put on tariffs on China intellectual property and into it for intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer the market's gone straight up from them I was kind of laughing this was like one of these\nFrom them I was kind of laughing this was like one of these what are the things you've got you've got ten data points less drop out the fire to

because she's bringing these accusations without any kind of drop rating evidence and we can't forget that weight and\nShe also mentioned college you mentioned that she didn't do well in college two years after she alleged that she had the sexual thought she said she didn't do well in college because of that she did well in high school you know really what was going on during that period sheltered changed the timeframe from being in the mid eighties or early eighties she kept\nPushing it back and forth with it happened in college or is it happened in high school you know really flush out exactly what her story is she right on the stand the lawyer would grill her about this\nThey would grow or about the details of hurt continent but somehow we have to hold her with kids was\nRight and again feminists were supposed to be about equal treatment I thought ... women are strong enough to stand on their own and they're not a bunch a damsel in distress and yet\nHow you're exactly right on the ... last night um the entire angle the opening monologue was devoted to\nThe a credibility gap for moves forward in relation to the entire matter and extensively relying on\nAnd on an unbiased prosecutor who\nWas a sex crime prosecutor who my political figure who said look changing narratives changing story of a memory of even recent events she seems to change or is unclear or not a case that would be brought even under a preponderance of evidence standard not a\nI'm not a beyond a reasonable doubt but a preponderance standard\nSo no probable cause even to undertake an investigation given the lack of cooperating information but in a in a culture where you're writing DC we're feeling Trump's facts\nThen you know it's always going to be how ... how she makes you feel in her testimony\nWell that's exactly right it's about how she made people feel because\nI didn't even find her feelings credible to be honest and she didn't she didn't ... like someone who was just now bringing charges about this horrible thing that's so Trump traumatized her for four years to thirty six years affecting her college years and her marriage and everything else and redecorating and you know we had\nYou know emotion that corresponded with what she was saying a PDF the trauma and horrors of it all was there would've been more anger\nThere were more fear and passion and more directed a tooth attached she her anytime she ever talked about the assault\nShe was very attached and her description of it and and I don't mean innocent people can disassociate dissociate when they're raped and stuff but she wasn't right and this is thirty six years later and she said she has the TST which means that you're heightened in your awareness of what happened and so she just did not she was not ... to me on feelings or fat but\nAt the end of the day we need to look at the facts\nThe fact that measure up she lives in an environment and in high school that was very party environment that carried over to a degree in college I think she got off campus after that and and things calm down but you know again not to blame the victim but we need to look at the entire circumstance\nNo emotion that corresponded with what she was saying creepy TST and trauma and horrors of it all was there would've been more anger\nThere were more fear and passion and more directed a tooth attached she her anytime she ever talked about the assault\nShe was very detached and her description of it and and I don't mean innocent people can disassociate dissociate when they're raped and stuff but she wasn't

you think she got off campus after that and and things calm down\nBut you know again not to blame the victim but we need to look at the entire circumstance of her life and his life if we're going to bring this kind of thing up at the last minute Laura last we had to bring up with the contacts bus right before Supreme Court nomination that would be changing abortion possibly\nThere's a reason for that you know we've got to really we need to protect our country and protect presumption of innocence and this isn't just about Ford or or Kavanaugh\nIt's about our liberty principles and about our democracy about our society and and what are we going to hold his values going forward but at the principles that we're going to hold to to keep us all secure and free and personally responsible\nRight we're basically now a incentivizing unsubstantiated claims and incentivizing this type of intimidating menacing behavior of\nYou know attacking people in public restaurants or elevators or you know these the people who are always worried about safe spaces DC and triggers mental are the ones who are the first to get in your face first ones\nBecause they are driven by irrationality they've banned in fact\nThey've abandoned objectivity so they can't have a discussion on this level\nSo all they have their subject is kneeling and power and if you're not going to come to reason together if you have no basis of object objective truth in order to have dialogue than the most powerful the biggest bully in the room it's going to win and that's what we have going on than the feminist movement is a bunch of bully\nThey're bullying everyone in order to to advance their power and part of that student fans but there's always the struggle between men and women that there's always the threat and if you're always the victim then you always have power over those who are\nTrying to use you and you know so this is what's been going on in our culture it's been going on in different kinds of fears now what's going on in the titan relationship scare of men and women and its ripping our country apart\nAnd you know if we if this means that we have to let the races go free because we can't prove it it's better to stay presumption of innocence just said the innocent than it is to round up all the guilty\nOh I'm actually the fact that just real life that that's what it's about being in a grownup world\nKnow well I think again we see that these activists Soros folks who are costing flake\nWho lived up to his last name I mean the the their perpetual adolescence look at me look at me look at me watch me watch me you must listen to me don't you dare look away from me this is like a kid like an eighth grader this is not a serious adult with a serious way of\nUh of discussing issues they they mean to terrorize people you say bully I say terrorists with the type of political and emotional extortion they're playing this game and it it has to be exposed and resist it at all costs\nAnd they have to feel they have to feel the heat right back on them as Abu journal\nJust said the innocent than it is to round up all the guilty oh it was actually the fact that just real life that that's what it's about being in a grownup world\nYeah well I think again we see that these activists Soros folks who are costing flick\nWho lived up to his last name I mean the the their perpetual adolescence look at me look at me look at me watch me watch me you must listen to me don't you dare look away from it it's like a kid like an eighth grader this is not a serious adult with a serious way of\nUh of discussing issues they they mean to terrorize people you say bully I say terrorists with the type of political and emotional extortion they're playing the game and it it has to be exposed and resist it at all costs and and they have to feel\nThey have to feel the heat right back on them as as a journalist and I say this in a in a in a way meaningless journalists don't like to be demonize the fake news and so forth but imagine of journalists were finding themselves surrounded in an elevator\nWhere where citizens are one inch from their faith screaming at them and it I think that'd be the first ones to say wait a second year intimidating the press but what about intimidating a a a a citizen in a in a in a restaurant or at a gas station as as Maxine Waters urge people to go after them you know does that count at all apparently not you\nKnow and and but we like you said we need to fight back we we just can't sit back and take it which we've done for years and look where we are\nA ... that's one of my reasons for challenging a\nChristine Ford about you know her own behaviors I'm not I'm not accusing or anything I don't know what she did detailed day to day when she was in high school or college but I Know the environment she was and and again if we're going to prosecute him or questioned him prosecuting him than we need to ask her the same kind of questions\nAnd you know you can't answer if you can't show what kind of character you are\nUm you know when you're bringing these accusations up in the political sphere then why should we ... we are not obligated to believe you just because you make allegations we're not obligated to being ... just because you're allowed and bowling and yelling at us and and the restaurants\nYou know we're we're not you know we're not one to have to take it for you\nWe have a right to speak as well and I think more people need to speak out I think that's what the ... election was all about don't you\nI think
