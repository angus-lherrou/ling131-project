a reasons why we have the gas and coal Smith studio\nThey're here today and every show because you've been instrumental because you're you're in the school system and you've been a principal as well as a business woman in your past and so you have this thing started with the kids with the the the real young reporters and so you were one of the people are already in our process the spotted something that you liked about\nThe kids can you talk talk talk about your experience with a young reporters\nUh yes I've been involved with you guys for about three years now and I first met by the he had this great idea of bringing it to the classroom where\nThe students there would there to communicate a present listen question all the things you learn in a typical English classroom but it\nMakes it a whole lot more fun to come to the studio where they get to talk to in notes and we all know with technology today students aren't now they're all about texting and social media so they go into an interview to get a job and they don't know how to speak to the adult that's interviewing down south I mean it's a great opportunity for you to learn the skills necessary to be successful\nAnd you've you've sort of you've been involved with a couple of different schools 'cause I've known you we've been we've been doing in the class not necessarily your class from ... in the classroom for probably tend to eleven years we've been on the air for seven seven and a half years um but you've been you're currently with uh what's the matter\nWith that Korea six that school district which I'm not campuses Christ except high school in downtown Phoenix at twenty five ... in school\nThe school that we've been involved with you guys to stage elementary which is over thirty second street right around Thomas I Believe and uh uh uh Kurt Walker principle over there and you're the one who can exist to Kurt basically we preach here they're very much so that's been our country with those kids um we've been\nStudents aren't now they're all about texting and social media so they go into an interview to get a job and they don't know how to speak to the adult that's interviewing um saddening it's a great opportunity for students to learn the skills necessary to be successful\nAnd you've you've sort of you've been involved with a couple of different schools since I've known you we've been we've been doing in the classroom not necessarily your classroom moving in the classroom for probably ten or eleven years we've been on the air for seven seven and a half years um but you've been you're currently with a ... what's the matter\nWith that crashed six that school district which I'm not campuses Christ except high school and downtown Phoenix at twenty times happening on Indian school\nAnd the school that we've been involved with the guys that stage elementary which is over thirty second street are right around Thomas I Believe right and uh uh ... Walker principle over there and you're the one who connected us to Kurt basically sweet free she had that very much so that's been our continuity with those kids um we've been involved with the St Vincent DePaul in the past with their kids and their program we've been involved with\nUm oh gosh uh ... academy avail Pueblo which is part of um [noise] oh uh I\nKeep forgetting all these things all these different things we've been through the school system fewer Unified School district had a lot of different schools and a lot different organizations and we're always looking to expand our reach the kids and basically it's teaching them\nTo get over their shyness we don't look for the talented kid we don't look for the broadcast major looking for the shy as kids the kids who need to uh get over the hump as far as getting a voice or get over or get over the bullying aspect creating team that's sort of relates to doctors Steve\nWelcome back to camp and ex loving hundred we are\nThe young reporters the adult version but not necessarily the wiser version and uh I'm here in Studio with uh [noise]\nUh we have a Bob Lou\nSteve Kelly K lead in college and I call him a professor and that's where I'm going to go to now as far as the professor I Would like to know\nWho you are what you do and Wednesday professors real name given to your background ... to ... to ... I think he's ... he's he's a connected with due to the robot to to merchandise\nMerkin Deanie there that right written down there we go to the patriots Ellen's ... asking a good question so give us a little background\nSo I teach at age you\nIn the department of computing information systems which the combination up Matt in competition\nAnd uh I work on the application areas just playing with adult me that's that's like that's like a university talking to explain what can you break that down and what that means exactly okay so some of the things that I teach a date that I Know\nFor the perfect or I Would like to know who you are what you do and what does the professors real name given to your background Pete to ... to ... I think he's ... he's he's a connected with the to the robot do to to merchandise\nMerchant Deanie there at that rate Richard downing ... asking a good question so give us a little background\nSo I teach at the age you in the department of computing in from ... systems which is a combination up Matt in competition and uh I work on several application areas\nExplain was I don't mean that that's like that's like a university talking to explain what it can break that down what that means exactly okay\nSo some of the things that I teach at the age that I Know a class called decision making and the uncertainty\nBut typically decision making on this that and it's happening right now the hurricane okay so then we really don't know where it's going it's some idea of as going this could be separate pets that it's taking\nWhat should we be doing what the people who had that should be doing watch this bond that we'd be what should if he might be doing\nSo all these things they're looking at right now that's one of my research you're teaching as to what what what are their majors that you're teaching this to the majors\nOr the\nThe major mostly industrial engineers and company decides and those are my students mostly\nAnd so they they're involved in like preparations for disaster for no no\nThat included the mall in my field which is a combination of computer science industrial engineering and so on so it's a combination because they use all the tools that I'd go out look through my life which is basically mathematics and computer science\nAnd as I understand I mean from conversations you teach them it's like all over the world uh\nYeah I get I get invited to regarding whether it's they started getting my did look it's as you go to\nSay so on and so uh one of the other things with we've learned off a off Mike Reed is part of the star of the show is that uh you you do a nightclub sometimes than do sing or what do you do in nightclubs\nI listen and drink why [laughter]\nSo that's how you met Allen I guess yeah so the white water [laughter] yeah right so you are you at Berkeley wider boxing is stressed register for you and your career or what is that a why I'm a I'm not usually the wind but the nightclub bigger than your or like okay [laughter]\nSo what uh no I certainly the wine is what they get the best way in the federally you need that after a day ... regular still seems\nTo me that the more wind you drink the greater the uncertainty [laughter] I thought I saw it in your field where some of the pets you have for people that reached that condition\nOkay so the you know you you will do but [laughter]\nWe got another job I could trust or just real quite as a great start [laughter] with Peter you a blank must could tell us give us a little background who you are what you do and how how does that apply to the uh the of the predictive analytics or whatever you want to call it up here to tell you about okay well as far as\nHow it relates to predict of analytics I have no idea [laughter]\nI'm a I'm an attorney here in here in Phoenix um was not the the path I\nThought I was going to take what was the path you thought you're going to take a I spent ten years working with um kids and\nFamilies are who are at risk and\nThe more wind you drink the greater the uncertainty [laughter] I find it in your field where some of the pits you half the people that reached that condition\nOkay so the you know you you will but [laughter]\nWe got like a toy gets real quite as a great start [laughter] with the two are Blake must could tell us give us a little background and who you are what you do and how how does that apply to the uh the of the predictive analytics or whatever you want to call it up he was talking about okay\nWell as far as how it relates to predict if analytics I have no idea [laughter]\nI'm a I'm an attorney here and here in Phoenix um was not the the path I\nThought I was going to take what was the path you thought you're going to take a I spent ten years working with um kids and\nFamilies are who are at risk in in Maricopa County or kids in foster care kids in CPS custody did that for about ten years and then my wife serene and I were talking and decided to go to law school which was a second career choice for me stuff\nAnd and I know the rest of the switch or was it any regrets I'm you know I think the only regrets\nI have are getting farther and farther away from you know I have passion for for helping people and helping children I'm helping people but in a different way right now\nWell guess what uh part part of the reason why I like I I don't know like just a little bit over the last few weeks was law office\nAnd he was brought to my attention to this person to bring on radio from that law office and I ... one conversation I realized he they were absolutely right until Blake you're going to get the opportunities for what you're doing with us to be able to do both so great get ready for a fun\nRight everybody here has a fun ride and um the Ellen and he gets to pick on me on to what is it going\nTo say it's just save Ron ... that we were talking earlier and I was kidding around and I said that he is I don't forget that journey yeah I had\nNo idea\nBecause oh I won't say why are we said that by foot but I said to him well you know there's\nA well when you're not a divorce attorney you know I I work with we play one on TV right now I work at it\nGets in mainly on legacy so we we primarily do estate planning asset protection and wealth preservation\nOf like the original low the original founder that organization that John good soon or passed away recently um was a good friend\nIt's a fabulous a law firm or they deal with some of the wealthiest clients in the valley and probably beyond the um and they are one of the things they preach I Know is a is to help us to teach people how to use their wealth for good purposes that's one of their is not one of the constants kind of a firm\nYeah it is um you know the wealth preservation was a term coined\nBy I'm Colleen a it's a highly manly calling manly who's the managing attorney right now I'm her dad coin that I'm just as a way for people to plan for the unpredictable right P. too I'm In the future\nAnd so a one on one of the one real quick note on that or I was a pragmatic idealist kind of like you in that and there's there's something to be said about you you know you need to provide your own\nSecurity and it buys you freedom and I think that's probably what you and your wife maybe we're talking about at one point that you know in terms of progressing or careers are ... using your talent and ... somebody put something in a little bit of a whole but now we can do both at the same time let's get to where it's a third gets over here I'm\nKelly I'm going to ask you that right okay can you give us a give us all your quick go background and what you what you do on where you came from in the past you've taken okay\nAll right so I'm the executive director swift youth foundation what is swift youth foundation sweat foundation and a half\nTo plan for the unpredictable right through to 'em in the future\nAnd so a one on one of the ... real quick told him that uh I was a pragmatic ideal is kind of like you know and there's there's so many we thought about you know you need to provide your own\nSecurity or buys you freedom and I think that's probably what you and your wife maybe we're talking about at one point that you know in terms of progressing careers are ... using your tail and ... somebody puts them in a little bit of a whole but now we can do both at the same time it was worth a third gets over here I'm\nReally I'm going to ask you that right yup okay to feel it give us a give us all your quick go back around and what you what you do and where you came from when the path you take it okay\nAll right so I'm the executive director swift youth foundation what is with youth voters swift youth foundation is a federal one C. three non profit organization um started in Nineteen eighty you've been around in the valley for quite a while\nUm and we foster positive mentor relationships between at risk youth in college bound teens we do that through after school weekend an overnight can't programs\nSo what does that look like when it's happening when does it look like it looks like fun after school activities um and overnight campus kind of the big exciting thing that we do um and it's really everything that we do is a way to\nReally build relationships between um ... elementary age kids and positive gene mentors so the teens and the kids are\nParticipating in activities alongside one another um and really building relationships how do you find the mentors\nAre primarily word of mouth we partner with a number of um schools um youth groups I'm Around the valley and we are the teams I'll go through some training um to make sure that they're being positive role models as well as a pretty extensive application process uh to volunteer with us\nSo I'm curious about some of the more amazing moments you've seen the after care for it to you after school program in terms of how these generally at risk children of flourish in how they evolve almost like a butterfly\nSo I could go on forever to talk talking about that's\nBy and for every about two minutes for the commercial was was right but it may be a long time right\nUm so here's one example so most of our campers come up to our five day I'm for night overnight camp um that we do up in Prescott on and it's the first time being more than thirty minutes away from home in Phoenix and\nThe minute that they step off the bus not really knowing what what to expect and they're surrounded by the press got pine trees nature on\nTheir eyes are wide open and they they get off the bus and they see a bunch of teenagers cheering for them excited to see them\nUm which can be committing right but super exciting um and they walk into their first meal I'm at camp right after they get off the bus 'cause a lot of them come\nPretty hungry um and we will often see some of our campers um because they have um some students security um challenges at home will see campers\nAdmitted that they walk into the lodge where they eat lunch I'm\nJust I super huge I'm seeing that they get to eat we say all the love they can take and all the food they can eat 'em and that's just an amazing kind of first five minutes of being at campus seeing these kids\nUm and they walk into their first meal I'm at camp right after they get off the basketball out of them come pretty hungry um and we will often see some of our campers um because they have um some students security challenges at home camper\nAdmitted that they walk into the lodge where they eat lunch I'm\nSuper huge I'm seeing that they get to eat we say all the love they can take an opposite they can eat 'em and that's an amazing kind of first five minutes of being at campus seeing these kids\nAlso it's a major decision that he goes through one guy said that you know I'm picking on getting married or maybe I can use that to to\n... not only I don't I mean if you get married [laughter] no no no it's not the combination of modern okay so there's a lot of one of the major thing that that that divorce the charges isn't it [laughter] yeah one of the major\nThing that says is we all have you know we have a propensity for is the psychological part of the calls how do we know how do you accept risk and that we also talked about the utility function of every person\nYou know so it's ... and and and the objectives okay the the person is it's happened to be from Korea [laughter] and he says you know\nYou know my family to me I get married and then they got to do so so that all these things and now he knows he has to get married the question is\nHow does it go about deciding whether the family will tell him he had a bunch of what potential applicants each of them have interesting\n[laughter] sorry story yeah so what's this part of the ... or did you come up with that idea that they need to have that included\nNotes this caused some well this is I bet I taught at Harvard at ... at Stanford a deal it's called decision making good use the word them certain people that I use a ... left the probably stick predictive analytics as you say yeah\nLike I Want to ask you related to that because uh obviously there's a lot of a risk assessment in the legal field including an estate planning all that so hard when you're listening to ... to talk about that what what what triggers nearby related to you what you do with your\nA law firm um\nI mean earlier you said that uh we deal with\nYou know the wealthiest have clients so you know we also some of my favorite people that work with are are younger people are people who are starting businesses um so I have people come into my office who are thinking about starting a business and it's in a field they've been familiar with for a number of years and they want to talk through\nBut yeah it then but\nA deal it's called decision making good use them so that people that I use a ... left the probably the predictive analytics as you say yeah\nLike I Want to ask you related to that because uh obviously there's a lot of a risk assessment in the legal field including an estate planning all that so hard when you're listening to ... to talk about that what what what triggers near my related to you what you do with your\nUh law for 'em\nI mean earlier you said that uh we deal with\nYou know the wealthiest have clients so you know we also some of my favorite people that work with are are younger people are people who are starting businesses\nUm so I have people come into my office who are thinking about starting a business and it's in a field they've been familiar with for a number of years and they want to talk through you know basic pros and cons of what that would look like and you have to look at non compete clauses and\nUm whether or not what they're doing violates any of that and then planning for the future like what the step one and you know developing a name and a business model and moving forward one two three five years down the road\nAnd then did they go on ... and then they go on shark tank\nAnd so again freeze the transition from the involvement with the same the rich community which and then you were I think I remember I you're involved in housing you know talk about some what you did yeah\nI'd love to get 'em so I started uh working\nDirectly with children in their homes or their foster homes or group homes and they were the children who were at risk of being removed or going to the tension centers because they were fighting fighting running away um so I spent\nYou know three or four years doing that and then I became a high needs case manager so I was managing care um that's how I met my wife I\nDon't know how ethical that is who she is she needs care personal view of the therapist\nAround elected uh [laughter] I was working with um [noise] so I did that and then I\nOversaw a program manager for America up a county in my hobby county I'm so happy marriage for what a it's for a company called child and family support services a program manager was a great organization\nUm but essentially talking about are looking at risk and uncertainty I mean you're you're looking at a child's behavior\nAre due to you know triggering trauma and dissecting that behavior\nDeep as you can and looking at a five minute span where a child was flipping desks and punching people and I'm assessing what triggered that and\nI was like ... world is a little bit yeah [laughter] how about an hour and a guy on the line with [laughter] so\nWe only a short time for break I Want to get to the killing of a comment on this too but I'm transitioning from that to this you know structured legal thing it's got to be a tough transition I Would think emotionally and mentally for you is that is that a part of the change what emotionally\nUm I think I'm a much more sound person um it was really hard for me to to get off work and when I was working in ... and to be able to unplug and connect back\nInto my so this is this is better for you personally it'd be yeah in a more structured type of environment like a ... with all of your hearing we get again maybe about a minute right now how does this relate to your what you see it's we've got about three seconds we'll get back to the ... but how does that relate to your work with with\n... at clicked we're kind of trying to reach the kids before they're having a that's triggering moments where they're letting desk I'm inviting people [laughter] so we're we're really working with the kids in the middle who are kind of getting getting locked they're not getting special attention because they're\nDoing you know triggering things\nEmotionally um I think I'm much more sound person um it was really hard for me to to get off work and when I was working in paper often to be able to unplug and connect back\nInto my so this is this is better for you personally to be in a more structured type of environment as a ... with all of your hearing we get maybe about a minute right now I was just relate to your what you see it's we've got about thirty seconds we'll get back to that but how does that relate to your work with what\nWell at click were kind of trying to reach the kids before they're having a does figuring moments where they're flipping death I'm inviting people are so we're we're really working with the kids in the middle who are kind of getting getting knocked they're not getting special attention because they're\nDoing you know triggering things\nLike this is very interesting what you're saying again it could release um we're going to reverse will break your I'll bring up I'll make a comment we come back but I Want to get back to getting ready to break we are

three six nine I'm your host Roman Allman\nAnd today we are going to be discussing\nThe dirty rotten politics especially what's going on in the district of corruption\nOr with the do nothing Congress and frankly I'm the Republican corruption continues nonstop\nA in a half hour after seven thirty mark we will have a candidate for governor David Garcia calling in but in the meantime we have two very special guests with us women up power\nWonderful people and and frankly very indicative of what my all the women in my family are doing and they are mad [laughter]\nSo ah Donna great house who is the publisher Hi Donna good morning Roman and Sophia Rauner who's an attorney how you do so the um great ah also listening in with us today but not like me we're not going to do much of the talking today\nAnd uh that's a Joe Murphy who's the co chair of the progressive caucus the law\nDonna hey what did you think of what the kangaroo slippery I mean the Senate did with the Supreme Court\nSo I watched that Susan Collins entire testimony which was an interesting\nMass ah lying and sampling and evasion\nAnd there are couple well there's several things he did a couple of main points that she tried to emphasize what's first\nThe hall a well I Believe\nDoctor for it but that she must be diluted I guess she was really promoting the idea that Dr Ford didn't know what happened to her and this should Susan Collins mind\nMade it feel to her like it was okay to move forward with his nomination the second thing she did that I paid a lot of attention to and I'm not sure others did which she spent a lot of time\nOn a cabin on how to use on roe v Wade and even grits while the Connecticut which is decision that leader\nSo I watched a Susan Collins entire testimony which was an interesting\nMess of a lying and stumbling and invasion\nAnd there are couple while there are several things you did a couple of main points that she tried to emphasize was first\nThe whole uh well I Believe\nDoctor for it but the she must be diluted I guess she was really promoting the idea that Dr Ford didn't know what happened to her and this to Susan Collins mind\nMade it feel to her like it was okay to move forward with his nomination the second thing she did that I paid a lot of attention to and I'm not sure others did which she spent\nA lot of time on a cabin on his views on roe v Wade and even grits while the Connecticut which is decision that legalized contraception and it seemed like she really wanted to emphasize and make it clear that\nOh you know Brett Kavanaugh doesn't want to overturn or or undermine any of these previous decisions so don't worry about it it's okay\nI Believe this is also a lie a very big ally and and one that we're going to learn very quickly is is not the case with Brett Kavanaugh\nI'm Sophie do you think that if these are scheming people want to overthrow roe v Wade that they're not going to find a way to do it and they're going to simply say what but this was a different situation\nSo first I Want to make it clear that whether or not the issue so if we look at\nAnd all aspects of his life and he is running for state treasurer of Arizona to bring transparency accountability fiscal responsibility\nAnd great idea to the treasure as often as such as promoting public banking and children's banking you talking to a treasured\nFrom all over the country it's such as the treasurer of Pennsylvania treasure revenue New Jersey did you know New Jersey it's I think an starting a public bank live North Dakota hats came after New Jersey but yeah my I told the area that's a very wealthy stay an Arizona followed suit suit were growing and and rent in getting rich state it would be really terrific to have a public bank\nGuide I have got to ask you this question because you know we may wonder and I wonder all the time how can\nThe ... world continue to support the Donald how come they can ... continue to support people like Kavanaugh when there are so often in so contrary to the Bible and everything else and I was told\nBecause they promised us they get rid of same sex marriages and they promised us that they would get rid of road the wage so I Am\nPleasure of uh Pennsylvania treasure of new New Jersey did you know New Jersey it's I think an starting a public bank live North Dakota has he imagined New Jersey what am I on the area that's a very wealthy state and an Arizona followed stew soup we're growing and and rent and getting rich state it would be really terrific to have a public back\nTo health care guys I held on to ask you this question because you know we may wonder and I wonder all the time how can\nThe avenge elliptical world continue to support the Donald how come they can continue to support people like Kavanaugh when there are so Boston and so contrary to the Bible and everything else and I was told\nBecause they promised us they get rid of same sex marriages and the problem is those that they would get rid of Robie wage so I I Know it was an of support\nIt's actually a very consistent people think it's hypocritical but it's really not if you think of this whole like white patriarchal world view\nThe idea is a guy like Donald Trump should be able to do whatever he wants whenever he watch as a kitten forgive him because he is the man in charge so it's the lesser it's women people of color or other marginalized groups\nIf you if you send in their conception of it you get to be punished for your entire life because you violated outdoor audition but not the man ... not the man in charge and that's why you look at these places like Colorado City the where they have one man and\nA bunch of wives and they drive the other boys out of the community because they want to maintain that system of a very higher out there like a like a pyramid or a triangle with a man a white man a wealthy white man firmly on top and Donald Trump is that man to him\nSophie were pretty religious and I I don't care what people say whether they believe in God or not you still can be religious you can be religious to to the rest of your human caring\nHow can a man like Kavanaugh say roe v Wade is settled and he knows them we're always going to bring it though\nIt's just the nature of the law remember that the law is always open to interpretation in addition there's always some fact or there is some case and that's and\nThat can change what had been well established precedent so he can say right now roe v Wade is tablets of course it's established it's on the book\nI mean to say that it's not establish would be to deny the fact that there was a ruling made with regards to roe v Wade ... but you can change it at any time and that's the\nThat's what people don't understand about the law is that it's always a moving target\nExactly I mean when I when I understood that I I don't want abortion to be illegal and women to be criminalized and go to jail for it 'cause I actually don't want a change with law and most Americans don't actually want the change of this law\nI'll show you a very simple way that they could change it they could say OK after two months you can't have it anymore because now it's a ... which is nonsense so they can do anything they want\nIn Arizona there's a state law and the books that that predates the way it's one to five years in jail for the woman and the doctor\nThirteen thirty six so far I agree and I think that that is Donna brings up great points with regards to roe v Wade and she's right at any moment it can be overturned and\nIt's not what people want but remember in law school even we eat lots of forget about it we're not even court there was All right and I went to a Jesuit law school and so one of the issues we did discuss was roe v Wade and the issue of viability right now the\nTested it's defeated viable or is it not and if the fetus is not viable then you\nBut change it they could say OK after too much you can't have it anymore because now it's a viable feed it switches nonsense so they can do anything they want\nArizona there is a state law and the books that that predates roe v way it's one to five years in jail for the woman and a daughter\nThirteen thirty six so far I agree and I think that that is Donna brings a great points with regards to roe v Wade\nAnd she's right at any moment it can be overturned and it's not what people want\nBut remember in law school even we eat lots of forget about it we're not even court there was All right and I went to a Jesuit law school and so one of the issues we did discuss was roe v Wade and the issue of viability right now the\nTested it's defeated viable or is it not and if the fetus is not viable then you\nHave a right to an abortion but if the fetus is liable you can only have an abortion if your life at risk and so remember with technology that\nTerm viability is getting closer and closer to that point or even conception but so that is why I'm In addition even the term viability can be manipulated\nExactly eat as a matter of fact in the Old Testament there was a totally different a standard that they used about whether or not you can get an abortion and and they didn't have any limits a when a woman can do this you know so there was quoting the Old Testament\nWell they're all over the it depends on what they want to ban if it's a heartbeat they they'll decide well the heartbeat shows up around six six seven weeks or so and and really the heart it's just a muscle but your fingers very prominently and very human mythology right so so what the anti abortion zealots do they'll ... they'll just really emphasized like\nOh abortion kill the beating heart it's a beating heart but there is no brain activity yet I mean if you wanted to do if you want it to its tablet liability at a point where\nThe fetus has more human characteristic it would be actually one of the brain starts developing and maybe there's some a sensation or if you just have a heartbeat and it's really not but then they go back to like\nWell we also don't think I you'd jeeze should be legal because there's a one and one woman told me a an anti abortion woman told me\nYou know if there's one in ten thousand chance the ... D will cause a fertilized egg to be extinguished\nIt should not be available that as an important\nAbout either I've yeah women say the same thing I heard religious women say that and I think that not just religious women but religious men and they believe that there's something so awesome in a moment of conception that\nAt the point of conception that is a in Athens A viable fetus and can we are interfering in in in\n... when the man let me let me it was really weird I quickly running out of time you're let me ask\nYou this question how can these people excuse the fact that cabin all committed perjury when he was testifying to the Senate how can they excuse the fact that committing perjury is you know illegal it's against the law\nThey have been doing it for years already with it I mean he's he's already committed perjury and nothing has been done about it he's actually been given a federal position despite that is happening and actually you see this problem in the court very rarely\nDo judges hold people accountable for lying under oath but remember there is something that we as Americans can do\nEven if he gets into power we can impeach him and there is a process to remove cabinet from the court I remember when the Republicans came into power in twenty sixteen and and to their president now took\nAll three branches of government\nIn fact the cabin all committed perjury when he was testifying to the Senate how can they excuse the fact that committing perjury is you know illegal it's against the law\nSo they had been doing it for years already with it I mean he's he's already committed perjury and nothing has been done about it he's actually been given a federal position despite this happening and actually you see this problem in the court\nVery rarely do judges hold people accountable for lying\nUnder oath but remember there is something that we as Americans can do\nEven if he gets into power we can impeach him and there is a process to remove cabinet from the court I remember when the Republicans came into power in twenty sixteen and into their president now took all three branches of government\nThey were very focused on dismantling what people had built for decades and so that we have to look and turn around and say look we have the power to dismantle what you just did and we will\nYou know I ... I Know you guys are going to have to ... book right at the half hour mark when you're going to have a governor's a Kim governor candidate\nComing on here but I Want to invite you guys to keep coming back because we really need to bring this out there to the public they have been so brainwashed by these politicians that they are allowing our government to be corrupted and dismantled and destroyed\nYou know so I I Hope both of you will continue to keep coming here because you're out valuable assets a Donna\nMhm do you think that women gay people\nMinorities are going to come out and vote so that we can get rid of this corrupt government\nUh yes I I think they absolutely will I think will there be enough to come out will be the question because Mitt terms don't favor our side and there are a lot of structural reasons for this um or voters tend to be younger lower income they don't watch a cable news all day [laughter]\nAnd they're just got to know and when you go out and talk you talk to voters you guys talked about it\nAnd you know when you talk to the regular voters are sort of a real difference in the level of participation between them and people like that whereas on the Republican side they have an older whiter electorate and those people crawl through broken glass is election and our people are more like\nWell I have to be inspired I have to be this or sometimes they simply can't get out of work because an election day on a Tuesday does not work for a lot of people who are working or they just don't have time they're working a lot of jobs and they don't have time to pay attention to all the issues so we always have those struggled to get our people out and I think the key is just\nLike improve I mean like young people voted a very low rate midterms it's like twenty nine percent it's abysmal it's always been the case if we can work on them and get that up to thirty four thirty five percent and we can ... increase women Latino all our all our constituent groups than we definitely have a shot and it's a highly didn't do it how\nDo we change the mind of our so called progressive people who say well I don't want to vote for this person 'cause she's not a hundred percent ... how how do we get them to understand that you are voting for your life\nSo I think that first we have to make sure that they are at the table I think that structurally we asked to make sure as\nAt various parties whether you are a democratic whether you are you know from the social you know from the whole gamut of um the left we have to make sure that they feel that they're at the table and when they are\nFor thirty five percent and we can ... fruit increase women Latino all our all our constituent groups then we definitely have a shot and it's a highly didn't do it how\nDo we change the mind of our so called progressive people who say well I don't want to vote for this person 'cause she's not a hundred percent your ... how do we get them to understand that you are voting for your life\nSo I think that first we have to make sure that they are at the table I think that structurally we asked to make sure as\nAt various party whether you are democratic whether you are you know from the social you know the whole gamut of um the last we have to make sure that they feel that they're at the table and\nTo make up for it in other words you cut the university\nSo back to sleep because if we could raise tuition or a good race too much she didn't have to pay the legislature do during the passing the buck the everyday working families with respect to community colleges by effort for universal colleges in Arizona it's part of\nOur constitutional obligation\nTo have a public university nearly free as possible we've got a lot of students just like you who start their higher education journey at the community college it's a great opportunity great way to keep costs down in the boat that move on to the university\nBut more importantly our community colleges are that place but we can still create high tech ... great middle class jobs\nIn manufacturing health services for example the server\nUm but that help students who may not want to move on to the university but ... a credential to get out there and build on where people would actually it's a short sighted\nLet me ask you another question to uh and if I'm going real fast is because we got a lot of ground to cover but what I'd like to know is this\nYou know they keep talking about how they are so business friendly so pro business and yet they do everything possible to make a damn near impossible for small business community business\nFor for the Arizona businesses to actually operate in this state they keep giving them money to to the predatory corporations but nothing for the people businesses\nAre focused um it's twofold with respect to business development my focus in Arizona number one that we need to invest in starting building and stay in Arizona and reason for that those local businesses grow roots are the ones that get\nBack and money stays in the community and so we're going to focus on that\nA lot of ground to cover but what I'd like to know is this you know they keep talking about how they are so business friendly so pro business and yet they do everything possible to make a damn near impossible for small business community business\nFor for the Arizona businesses to actually operate in this state they keep giving them money to to the predatory corporations but nothing for the people businesses\nAre focused I'm too old with respect to business development my focus in Arizona the other one that we need to invest in but this is starting building and say you know not everyone but reason for that those local businesses grow roots are the ones that get\nThat money stays in the community and so we're going to focus on those but in the mission of the key area for Arizona from an economic development standpoint you go back to education we are continually ... because we have a uh we'd go out with a ...\nWho do not have a highly qualified workforce and so my effort to improve public education have all the way up through the university ... ... we can make a mistake or\nYou know David we have a couple of big fan of yours there will be here I'm going to go to Donna Donna what's on your mind what David can do for the state\nWell I you know I have watched a huge debate that you know you've participated in with do you see and I understand that he failed on our third debate and I'm just really frustrated that new plane had ...\nBeen asked about his support for Brett Kavanaugh and about roe v way which I think are two really important issues to Arizona right now governor got a question on their second debate\nNone of the male moderators would ask him about women's issues at all and I found that very frustrating and do you feel like that do you see in trying to avoid these fashion [noise]\n... that is an outstanding observation uh our ... our communications director ... appeared on my lap let me tell you when we were ready for that question we were ready to go for any health care was going to a wreck Kavanaugh answer women's reproductive\nWindow of workplace safety issue they tell me how committed you are making your workplace and you will be running when I was a governor safe for women and other vulnerable people from being attacked and I just want to put that out there to\nThe question is do we know that they did not come back in the first health care can come up at all but I'll tell you what we did because I thought this was important for Arizona particularly women are the owners and the families\nOf those on it to them in the ... we had a channel twelve it out\nOut to do another debate you know so they gave us a half hour we specifically out to talk about ... cabin uh good so that we could make it clear that out governor into every single build that come to my desk\nThat restricts a woman's right to make her own reproductive choice and health because we made sure that was the case\nIn the warm and good to be with me I have some control\nAre excellent thank you David we're going to have to go into a break and then we will be back\nTo the break after the break to ask you some other questions are folks you are listening to voice of democracy Arizona and independent

reproductive a joke but uh we make sure that was the game\nIn the warm and gets me with some control\nAre excellent thank you David we're going to have to go into a break and then we will be back to

back after the break and come back to us after the break oh\nNot yet oh you want me to drag it out okay it's okay why don't you ask the question and then they can think about it during the break\nOkay wonderful so I have actually worked with family or the last decade in Arizona and one of the big issues that we saw in the last ten years was that in Arizona itself more children removed some parents and more children um were permanently sever contaminated and their parents and so\nI'm right now we're seeing that\nIssue that Puerto ... right here in Arizona What well are well you can't yourself

could see that you don't get the\nProtective thing for your many you'll have a welder no doubt you'd be flaming all kinds of stuff it's amazing\nThe way that article was set up was a that it was just forgotten I think it's more than just forgotten in the design a Larry you've been around man I mean are close to fifty years and it's a designer of hot wheels\nYeh started or the second year of hot wheels so they started sixty eight I started sixty nine\nAnd it was just looking for a job middle and then somebody or somehow came across this job but you know I'll drop toy cars for a couple of years so I could find a real job and I'm Still they're forty nine years later well Susie I mean now\nLike we know that with your history you could have easily gotten into the arena\nGood to see that you you don't get that\nProtective thing for your many you'll have a ... year old yeah not now have you been flaming all kinds of stuff it's amazing\nThe way that article was set up was a that it was just forgotten I think it's more than just forgotten in the design a lawyer you've been around man I mean are close to fifty years and it's a designer of hot wheels\nYeh started or the second year of hot wheels says they started in sixty eight I started sixty nine and I was just looking for a job middle and then somebody I somehow came across his job and I thought you know I'll drop toy cars for a couple of years so I could find a real job and I'm Still they're forty nine years later\nWell soon as the I mean now like you we know that with your history you could easily gotten into the arena of designing real cars that first year of hot wheels tell me what that was like for you 'cause that was a big transition I imagine for you\nWell ahead a officially come from Fort I was a designer back in Detroit and the the weather guy that got to me so I came to California you know almost with I had a job but I just kept looking for another job\nAnd I heard about this one through a friend that I went in and interviewed he just happened to be one he wanted to do space stuff this was the space time you know really wanted to do space stuff he wasn't a car nut so I said yeah I'll I'll drive cars and the weirdest thing for me was when you work in Detroit\nThey weren't in a hurry and work on grills indoor animals for weeks on end and overtime and you do all this stuff I Walk in and they said okay we did a car and three days chief whole car in three days from I supposed to do this and of course that's one thing I'm fast so I had no problem and I've been doing it ever say\nWell that's slow I mean people don't realize that that door handle they use every day that was like six months or deal it was it was arduous that's what you were speaking on\nYeah exactly I didn't go to Detroit do door handles but you know you had you had to earn your keep you out to dinner or handles\nAnd work your way up and I was just a kid for two years working there and I got this really neat stuff but it wasn't you know wasn't challenging like I was hoping to do and I never thought I'd actually designing toy cars but you never know in life you know you just go out there and find out\nIsn't that what makes them special you you said not a situation and then they see you know you're almost fifty years later Susie you had mentioned a off air about the bones shaker\nThe teacher that his bones shaker with this colon bones that was one of my favorite cars growing up that in fact Larry I'm just going to tell you it's great that saved me a little bit because I grew up in the inner city we didn't have much in hot wheels weren't inexpensive thing to do\nI mean you could buy them you can collect them you became them when you were creating these design did you\nFeel that that you would have ... more than just having a car in somebody's hands\nOne thing about hot wheels you you can do you know the old for her to you can copy Detroit you can do this or the other thing and then you go the other direction do cars that are completely nuts and I'm kind of a hot rod or so I was kind of in between I could go either way but I my favorite was doing ... customs\nSo I started drawing a hot rod AT T a you know the bucket hot rod and then I said oh why don't we do this we do that I actually throw away the sketch where the bone shaker\nI was thinking I had seen some bottles in a motorcycle magazine or something you know and I'm sitting there at work and drawn away and kinda through that thing away and and I brought it back out and I reached my trash I pulled it back on it with all wrinkled and everything I said you know maybe there's something more to this I\nGot a call on the front of it and oh this is starting to work and of course half a problem with our wheels you have to make it affordable you know it's still a dollar after fifty years and um and put the pieces together and I ... I had to actually have the top open so you could look inside she the seats and the gas\nYou know the old for for a two year can copy Detroit you can do this or the other thing and then you go the other direction do cars that are completely nuts and I'm kind of a hot rod or so I was kind of in between I could go either way but my favorite was doing hot rods customs\nSo I started drawing a hot rod AT T a you know the bucket hot rod and then I said oh why don't we do this we do that I actually throw away the sketch where the bone shaker\nI was thinking I had seen some of the motorcycle magazine or something you know and I'm sitting there at work and drawn away and kinda through that thing away and and I brought it back out I reached my trash and I pulled it back on it was all wrinkled and everything I said you know maybe there's something more to this I\nGot this call on the front of it no this is starting to work and of course half a problem with a hot wheels you have to make it affordable you know it's still a dollar after fifty years and um and put the pieces together and I ... I had to actually have the top open so you could look inside she the seats in the gas tank and the shift laboring the steering wheel\nI wanted to make it real detailed other than just the skull so yeah it was a it was a project in you know you never know when you do something if anybody's going to care about it\nThat's so cool and so we um when I was watching a Youtube video of you I was watching a video where you were describing on how ... how you created so you actually start with sketch it is that right you just ... I always\nGet cars ever since I was a teenager and sometimes I sit in front of the television and you know kind of a blank look on my face watching TV or something in sketching ... you know in front of me just drawing stuff on every once in a while like I say you get a\nYou get an idea and you kind of put it down and then you say work and I go from this and yet it may take a while and then sometimes you you know you put a should often say not this year maybe next year\nSo you never know what you're going to be working on the next couple of days\nRight and it said something like it takes about a year to actually come up with the design everywhere idea\nTo the time it's on the shelf and it takes about a year or you have to make all the models and after ... with with the new uh computers now it's completely different from the old days we used to hand make all the bottles and approve 'em and everything\nNow you look at the computer and you can turn it and take a look at it and they then they they have a F. L. E. machine that actually makes the real part so you know what the exact size is going to be you're not guessing what it's going to be like if you do a big pattern and stuff so completely different for much faster and uh but still pretty much a year to comes out\nThat's neat many audience a seem to have a ritual that takes into space and gifts in ... design mode mini listening now or artists musicians in the original for you Larry that you go to a certain place at a ... in that mode\nWell not really for me it's kind of that's what I Am a some kind of what I Do I like I said I Do it on or off hours and and they just like it doesn't really make any difference to me when I Walk in and sit down and I like turning out a life ... you know and thinking I got sketches\nI got a couple of magazines I maybe I'm looking at or something so to me it it didn't really\nYou know driving it on my car in the morning sometimes you get an idea so it ... it wasn't like an on and off and then once again you had to make the car you had to do the engineering drawings and make it into the real car too so that took you know another month of your time and then you'd go off to the next one you'd probably be working on one or two maybe three at the same time\nThat original design for the moon shaker you crumble that up you through it in the trash is that still around and said for auction [laughter] yeah it's on my wall there you go at it I'd really keep that one yeah we're talking with Larry would have a hot wheels legendary designer responsible for all those\nAmazing cars and muscle cars in the wild and crazy like the bones shaker um is it true\nI don't I don't want to say this is my Internet Laura but did you put your actual phone number on one of the design of hot wheel cars that went to the public\nIt wasn't like an on and off and then once again you had to make the car you had to do the engineering drawings and make it into the real car too so that took you know another month of your time and then you'd go off to the next one you'd probably be working on one or two maybe three at the same time\nThat original designed to the bone shaker you crumble that up you through it in the trash is that still around and said for auction [laughter] yeah it's on my wall there you go at it I really keep that one yeah\nWe're talking with Larry would of a hot wheels legendary designer responsible for all those\nAmazing cars and muscle cars in the wild and crazy like the bones shaker um is it true I don't I don't want to say this is my Internet Laura but did you put your actual phone number on one of the design of hot wheel cars that went to the public\nUh that's currently in the um the Murphy out a museum and and uh since November it's it's been on display and\nAnd I love the fact that people are really enjoying that and that's what it's all about the to open up and inspire the car people's um you'd mentioned earlier you talked about the grass roots are as far as a car building and and the average Joe so to speak building cars\nYou know what I found out I started out the same way I was in a small garage in a small town in Indiana and I thought you had to have the best of everything the best garage the best tools in order to make it to do anything or even to compete\nUm but I've learned that that's not true of some of the coolest divides commodities back would garages or small towns\nThat are just ... unbelievable and and and I I'm I'm happy to to spread the word and let these guys know that it's not all about the money as far as building car this that passion is that it's that drive that\nAnything special could come out if you just make the effort in and take the time and do it is possible and and and I love the fact that hot wheels is is promoting that that is so important because you're right anybody can just lay down some cash and builds and have stuff being built crazy that's not what it's all about\nAnd it's so so so neat to to to be involved with with the group and uh be able to do this\nYeah no doubt in fact we had brother J. D. from wrench wars\nAre out of Venice so he was on the show and one of the things he talked about it since the backyard situation\nOr we can all agree like we're watching nothing you can see among we love the email this from the animal talent going on but as just a layman maybe someone that just wants to do a weekend project with their son or their daughter we're looking at these rides\nYou know with a lot of these shows are like oh snap and that's a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand never going to get that done\nAnd I loved the spirit is he said ... that we don't since ...\nVoting that that is so important because you're right anybody can just lay down some cash and builds that have stuff being built crazy that's not what it's all about and it's so so so neat to to to be involved with with the group and uh be able to do this\nYeah no doubt in fact we had brother JD from wrench wars\nAre out of Venice so he was on the show and one of the things he talked about it it's the backyard situation\nOr we can all agree like we're watching nothing you can Sima we love the email this from the animal talent going on but as just a lame and maybe someone that just wants to do a weekend project with their son or their daughter we're looking at these rides\nYou know with a lot of these shows are like oh snap that's a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand never going to get that done\nAnd I love the spirit and she said can\nThat we'll just really keeping it real and wrong it's attainable it's approachable do you in your backyard and I think that's going to also help drive the youngsters like they're they're already somewhat intimidated because of technology let's face it\nAnd if they can go back to a time where you know it is scrapping out a little sheet metal ball pin maybe we're going to make this you know for big block sit at a certain way we'll have to modify\nLarry did you see these six pass and hot wheels started to involve more from the wild and wacky designs or was it more conservative like perhaps uh sixty two miles that want to spoil\nIt it it's been everything uh you know again that's what makes hot wheels interest to get a you know ... for for two older you get a and made you know crazy car and through the years about the only thing I remember once was when the gas crisis hit the marketing people say oh we've got to do a graph gas prices cars\nOh wait a minute wait a yeah I could only imagine what I did I I put a blown a motor in a piano and I uh I Am now now that you know like I said sure I'll do 'em and you know that was\nThat was the end of that and we tried it for one year and they were very successful even though they weren't gas mileage now that you know that's kind of\nStuff that the you know that you would get information input as you were going through the years but all in all basically they basically let us do the crazy stuff we wanted to do\nAll right so Suzie I'm thinking uh if if Larry Larry you've been out of hot wheels for a few years but if they approached it wasn't smart car would you make that sucker fat\nLow low actually that'd be kinda fun wouldn't have taken hanging out the back\nWait till they have to approach it and make it how like how do you know ...\n... ... in in the old days I only had to do six or ... cars a year and then different colors and I did all the stuff that was there for Twenty years I've just by myself\nThen after that it grew obviously there are a lot of people are now but\nUm now what you do is you put a whole wall of the boards up with\nYou know ten cars that are classics tank cars that are Japanese ten cars that are race cars ten cars that are out of this and so you just fill those slots it back in the day you just kind of picked a crazy let's do this or let's do that or there was a certain car you want to hear so it's you know changed like everything else well\nIt's taken a change I I bring this up on often not only from from industry friends with a lot of car enthusiast across the country\nUm do you see motor sports and specifically as it relates to design we went finance NHRA NASCAR which is popular now but now we've got the drift seen us these youngsters about John forest maybe and I say that respectfully John Force raising you gotta\nSo and then after that it grew obviously there are five people that are now but\nUm now what you do is you put a whole wall of the boards up with\nYou know ten cars that are classics tank cars that are Japanese ten cars at our race cars ten cars that are on this and so you just fill those slots
