historic lows doesn't matter\nThere's no there's no one pressing the left so I think he's right don't try to please the left do the right thing makes sure Florida is taking care of a it's a judgment call I could have gone either way on that frankly but\nIt is pretty it is pretty hard when you have all these people there and you you have taken care of business in Florida you got FEMA on it you got all the emergency station set up they're being given all the support they need and you're back in what two hours\nIt's it's I think it would have been a tougher call if it were in like Minnesota or California\nThen it's five hours out five hours back but it's not like the president isn't constantly on the phone I mean he does have world class communications on air force one this is not like you just checked out of the hurricane but again you're not pleasing these people let's go to Dennis in Florida\nWest Palm Beach Florida where I just was over the weekend ... red tide and I'm not talking about the kind we want was brutal\nI got my lungs still hurt from that red tide that fumes that uh I inhaled at the beach go ahead\nWe all have our issues here in Florida it's part of our lives our to what I Would like to say though is the last night I don't know if anyone mentioned but the lady that was on from the Democratic party [noise] um I don't know if you noticed or not but when you were talking about someone being hurt or even killed she actually smiled I found that a bit frightening\nI miss that I got to go back and look at that I'm so focused on the show I'm not kind of looking at the at the guest and the double boxer yeah I\nI'm very worried that someone's going to get hurt\nOr with how left in ... left wing and rabid and frenzy the left is becoming we're going to go back to the Eric Holder I'm going to remind you a little bit more of why Eric Holder was always a problem he's going to be running for president\nIt's holder if Booker it's perhaps Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren maybe all Bernie Sanders going to give it another world ah but I'm going to remind you of what kind of person\nIn the ... that Eric Holder is later on on the show for those of you who've forgotten remember he said yesterday when they go low we kick them basically\nIs Michelle Obama must love that\nLet's go to Virginia and Calvin on line one I Love the name Calvin Calvin do have\nYes I see a red wave me a dollar leeway in part of a state where I live\nUm we don't live up in a bubble of the DC area we live out in the ... or we're just so you\nHarris Elizabeth Warren maybe on Bernie Sanders going to give it another world ah but I'm going to remind you of what kind of person\nIn any a log that Eric Holder is later on in the show for those of you who've forgotten remember he said yesterday when they go low we kick them basically\nIs Michelle Obama must love that\nLet's go to Virginia and Calvin on line one I Love the name Calvin Calvin go have\nYes I see a red wave hobby a law that way in part of the state where I live\nUm we don't live up in a bubble of the DC area we live out in the ... orders were issued as though you\nCan hear your Calvin ... call back when you're on a good line you're in a brutal line there but I Love the commonwealth of Virginia\nVirginia changed demographically and it's changed politically and the connection is obvious guy\nOr immigration growing government presence change Virginia but I think the good people or Virginia see what's happened with this economy they don't want to go backwards\nAnd anyone out there listening anyone you know in Virginia seventh district thinking you're thinking of of not voting or your complacent you got to get out there and vote in the seventh district of Virginia especially and of course Dave Brat as what I'm Talking about\nThe day brat racist key he is\nA Trump guy he is a conservative he is hard working he seeks to represent the interests of the citizens of the commonwealth of Virginia and he does a great job get out and vote\nEverybody has to get out and vote if you can already voted early vote early but get out and vote Rhonda Santas in Florida he adds up against this Gillum this horrible socialist guilt we lose Florida governorship it's going to be a bad deal so everybody's got to get out and vote\nThat he and he's getting millions and millions of dollars from a left wing billionaires Gillum even as the mayor of a ... of one of the few cities in Florida that was handled Enron really badly you want him nowhere near the\nGovernorship I can tell you that right now eight five five forty Laura or go to Mike in Arizona on line three Mike\nHow are you I'm great I was so proud to be a conservative and I love my president I think you did a great job ... list I don't want him to cater to the Democrats had to go to what they're sitting and he should have\nBeen accused of of of being wrong then if you could go on down there and paid more attention instead he showed leadership you did what he was supposed to you had the ... or ... you were suffering because [noise]\nSo I see a red wave in our area\nI don't know of any Democrats get elected here I'm\nI'm just like\nMy own and then just like you got to hand it Tom Lacey did the right thing on Kavanaugh I mean\nHe that would have been a real kick in the stomach of conservatives if he hadn't voted for Kevin ... so that's a good thing I'm going to look at the glass half full here because that's the only way you can go forward or the Federal Reserve though I trusted I was going to do a segment on this last night on the show and we we we were so jammed up we couldn't do it\nOr going to do it tonight on the anger mangled to tune in ten pm eastern Fox News\nI mean he that would have been a real kick in the stomach of conservatives if he hadn't voted for Kevin ... so that's a good thing\nI'm going to look at the glass half full here because that's the only way you can go forward or the Federal Reserve though I trumpet I was going to do a segment on this last night on the show and we we we were jammed up we couldn't do it\nOr going to do it tonight on the anger mangled to tune in ten pm eastern Fox News [noise]\nAnd then they just get more desperate and I think this is going to go on for a while\nWell the the desperation comes in many forms nude and now the criticism is for the moment of Donald Trump takes a couple of hours to to fly out to Pennsylvania to do a rally for all these people who are waiting\nAnd of course now it's Donald Trump doesn't care about the victims\nDo which is which is nonsense I mean it's very clear that the\nPresident and his entire team had been working very closely with the governors of Florida Alabama and Georgia and I think it inappropriate to and the president will go down\nTo visit but as you know a head he tried to go down last night it would have been a nightmare because\nThat would divert all ... all of the various workers away from what they should be doing to trying to take care of the president's fate so he'll get their president but I also want to see just whatever Donald Trump does\nHe's gonna be attacked these people don't like him they wake up in the morning and they say I Know he's done something terrible what is it\nAnd that's kind of their approached everything right now and it makes them frankly a little bit nutty\nWell and I think that uh again the the theory and the friends the ah has gotten to a point I knew that when I was talking to folks now yesterday who were in Washington in the Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy or both assassinated\nAnd they were saying that they hadn't seen anything is is angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate yeah I think\nI think basically you a shorter intensity up through\nWatergate you had a we had a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point or you had soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports are being harassed or and it was a very bitter very device you time\nAh but I think after that uh we became sort of more normal for a while and uh now we're drifting back uh because\nFolks now yesterday who were in Washington and in Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy or both assassinated\nAnd they were saying that they hadn't seen anything is is angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate\nYeah I think I think basically you had extraordinary intensity up through\nWatergate you had a memory at a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point a US soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports are being harassed or they knew it was a very bitter very divisive time\nAh but I think after that uh we became sort of more normal for a while and uh now we're drifting back a because this is a genuine\nA cultural civil war I mean you know [noise] what Hillary Clinton said that it wasn't in actors that shot some people but she's basically right or when we're point or somebody like a justice cabin on\nIts because we want to return to a constitutionally based court system\nThat uses the American system is this model not some European or South African or other kind of system and as a result if your a left wing a Democrat we we we are at the end of your world ... you know they had hope desperately\nTo change America and now the American people are responding and saying no we don't want to say we liked Being American and I think that has become just an enormously bitter blow for the\nUh people who who thought up until election night two thousand sixteen they were ... Hillary Clinton who's gonna when they go at the two justices you've got\nAnd hell or even ... oh my God you know they they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution that will really been a very dramatic difference compared to where we are now\nOr I Want to play for you I'm Larry Sabato who of course famously bombed in his protections for twenty sixteen but nevertheless has this production for the midterms\nIf there has ever been an abnormal presidency were in it\nAnd the Trump is violated so many of the rules of politics and so many of the norms of politics a red wave ain't gonna happen it's just a question of how big the blue wave is they can be sued ami it could be a middle sized way they can be a small way it's going to be a blue wave\nOr what is your reaction thought well\nMaybe he's right but it probably isn't I'm In the first question I asked is how come we just won a you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent a Hispanic ah and we won for the first time in a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation\nOr how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee in Arizona's now head or how come that uh Kramer the Republican candidate in North Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points or in his in ah\nTennessee as people begin to realize the British and actually the Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get to a government run health system branch and starting to fall apart mhm and Tennessee is going to end up protecting remotely I'm just getting a sense of\nYou know something out of self sabotage and say oh where's the where's the blue\nThose were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent are Hispanic or and we won for the first time in a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation\nOr how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee in Arizona's now heads or how come that er Kramer the Republican candidate in North Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points uh in his in ah\nTennessee as people to realize the British and actually the Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get to a government run health system British and starting to fall apart mhm and Tennessee is gonna end up electric ... I'm I'm just getting a sense of\nYou know somebody out of self sabotage and say oh where's the where's the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races in any somebody's governors' races the one that I'm really watching is the Andrew Gillum\nVersus Ron I'm a dissent is because for me and for so many of watch the growth of Florida and\nHow well it's been a run by Rick Scott and and to the idea of turning that state over is critical is that state is that a country electoral politics\nTo a guy who is basically a socialist is just that just cannot happen and yeah he's got millions and millions of dollars nude from all the usual suspects\nCharlie Chaplin I mean you'll um is ah\nThe latest great hope because he came out of nowhere as a radical Democrats uh he won an upset primary victory\nOr ... temporarily looks very good I think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on but ... but when you say governorships remember that there's a study that just came out the ten most popular governors in states are all Republican every single one of\nThe ten highest rated governors or a Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor of Maryland hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide and the reason is exactly why we're building a majority in the country they\nGet results they don't just have resistance are they actually have things that work they don't just have fantasies and strange ideas and I think we have to be prepared to wage a campaign\nThat drives home again and again and again the difference between a the kind of left wing fantasies that are not you can't afford them you can implement I'm ah in the long run they're not going to work\nAnd I think that's one of our key jobs this campaign is to draw the distinction between results and resistance and certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of the resistance says the alternative\nYeah I I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turn out I think those images\nOf the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control\nA\nThink people like that they might not like everything Trump tweets or\nThey might be annoyed at some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I Would if I get that but I think the frenzy people want it all to calm down they just want things to calm down they want to come down on both sides\nAnd I so I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this ... thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know\nAnd to turn out I think those images\nOf the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control\nOr I think that's I\nThink people like that they did not like everything Trump tweets or\nThey might be annoyed at some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I what I get that but I think the frenzy people want it all to calm down they just want things to calm down they want to come down on both sides\nAnd I so I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this cabinet thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know fifty seat pickup ah so that's my sense of it in Holder's comment Maxine Waters\nI don't know I think all of it is it gives people a bad feeling\nWell and I think you can draw the contrast you mean here you have an economy which is\nBooming at a level people said was impossible your jobs being created yoga lowest\nBlack on unemployment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history or you have a remarkable achievers would deregulation you have solid conservative judges being appointed so every time you turn around right now you're seeing genuine results\nAnd then you have as you point out uh people who seem crazed\nUh I mean is this really the America you want you really want people who come into a restaurant to harass people and drive them out when people banging on the Supreme Court doors are and I and I think in some cases of course we know the George Soros and others actually pay for them uh which doesn't you know doesn't do justice for him\nBut the whole system that\nThe left has tried to create I think is in the end or not a sustainable system\nNewt I Know you're doing a lot of uh a vent before the midterm uh elections and there's one on October fifteenth or where\nYou can register to um attend an evening with Newt Gingrich and you'll be able to hear you talk about what's in store for the country what's at stake for the country in the mid term so how do people end

on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to day will change their story depending on what they're told to do\nUm you have now a bevy of organizations so he saw it in a cabin or hearings that send people out these aren't mob people these are targeted people who are paid to do certain things\nYou know to confront senators in elevators or with the CNN camera right behind them to ah prevent um Senator Cruz and his wife from having dinner the these aren't accidents are right to get Bill O'Reilly off the air\nAn accident mhm\nOkay so you have this and in the past journalism reporters would have

where you had a fanatical movement Nazi ism accumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods\nAnd there and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested was engaged and the media in Germany basically we're afraid of the Nazis and they wouldn't tell the truth about that\nThat was more of a fear thing than than a what we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress ones there cause in the media is the same cause that George Soros so it was a little bit more extreme than the editors of the New York times but not much\n[noise] so this big picture that's formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it\nUm and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I Would order an FBI investigation into the cabin or debacle\nBecause I Know and I think you do to that it was no accident Dianne Feinstein held back that letter from Dr Ford for six weeks that was not an accident\nIt was no accident it was leaked against Dr for its wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere\nBut let's say let's take it for face value that letter was leaked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked by somebody in Congress because only two people had the letter\nSo the FBI should be investigating that and should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they started that investigation which I Would order if I were president that scandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because\nThat was no accident what happened a cabinet\nAnd the women were all the women are lying by the way they were all line two and a couple of people are looking into this who actually knew or knew both of them now now you two of them and\nWhatever it was ... I went through this I went through this myself mhm All right and and I saw things\nLeveled against me that were insane\nAnd I you know at this point in this country people are gonna have to want to make a decision by the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want\nThey can do exactly what they want and they almost got Kavanaugh they almost got him and this is the kind of country what\n... is is it you're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except it except that because it's an ... been in play now for quite some time so who do you depend on\nTo get the truth the only the apparatus is the criminal justice system\nMhm right and and I saw things\nLeveled against me that were insane\nAnd I you know at this point in this country people are gonna have to ... make a decision alright the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want\nThey can do exactly what they want and they almost got capital they almost got him and this is kind of country one\nIs is it you're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except it except that because it's an ... been in play now for quite some time so who do you depend on\nTo get the truth the only the apparatus is the criminal justice system\nAnd I'll put forth a President Trump should really see a bigger picture he takes everything personally any fights back effectively himself but I don't know if you see in the big picture what's happening here\nYou know once you start to erode basic rights like presumption of innocence you process what'd you say they don't matter as the senator from Hawaii say don't matter\nDon't presumption of innocence at somebody accuses you of misconduct none you're guilty because in the past some women have been abused I mean think about it\nThey're they're attacking the fundamental rights that Americans have un habitat\nAnd nothing what is what is being done nothing and I think bill you know I mean it's a division but I'm just so worried about it I Can't\nI Am ...

know comparisons to the ss I'm a German heritage I've been called the Nazi\n'em and or if you look at if you look at their strategy I I'm worried about the long term and gave them that they're looking at it and that is the indoctrination of our you\nKnow once America wants the presumption of innocence as our allies that have gone\nAnd it's an accusation can destroy alive\nAnd it's doing it this is happening all over the country where these these some of these me to accusations\nAn accusation destroy your life\nThat you are in uncharted territory that's wild\nAnd when you can pull down statues in the middle of the night and be cheered on by local authorities\nOr they look the other way but they don't want to deal with it\nWhat is that what what does that green light in our society lawlessness\nWhen you can cross the border illegally demand rights and be released into society never being seen again\nWhat is that breed more lawlessness we have a lawlessness a that is being bred

a Steve DC on line or five Steve\nMessage yeah mhm I said go ahead\nI'm Sorry yes uh I I just want to make a comment real quick on on the party the Republican Party the party needs to\nTo be a party or that the message needs to be a unifying message of the Democratic messages the fish it uh it does not embrace\nUnity in any way it alienates learn Republicans need to promote the strength of of unity in unification and it's it's it was done as as far back as Frederick Douglass\nIn his speech what to the slave in the ... is the fourth of July we were speaking to a bunch of white women but [laughter] but she you know his take away you know the horrors of slavery and yet\nI promote an ex do the virtues of the constitution the declaration of independence these are not slavery documents

side and fight against it at the same time stay there [noise]\nUh it does not embrace unity in any way it alienates learn Republicans need to promote the strength of of unity in unification and it's it's it was done as as far back as Frederick Douglass\nIn his speech went to the slave in or is the fourth of July we were speaking to a bunch of white women but but she you know his take away the horrors of slavery yet\nI promote and stole the virtues of the constitution the declaration of independence these are not slavery documents these were liberty documentary them\nLike ... it's all that freedom\nAnd that liberty is June ... units that are at a\nTime my friend but I we get the point positive unified why you have to expose the other side and fight against it at the same time stay there [noise]\nJust quickly jettison by the left for political end I'm destroying individuals because they disagree with\nYou know the prevailing winds of a particular um political interest group and what you saw on the streets during Kavanaugh's lord knows what will happen if there's another Supreme Court opening\nAs an historian I find it fascinating as a political conservative I think there's much to rejoice to be quite Machiavellian about is is that the Democratic party is doing it so great great damage\nAnd you know you wouldn't worry if you you know if you're a conservative Republican you were if the Democrats came out and for strong national defense and tax cuts\nAnd morality at home and on the streets and law and order and and basically came out with the same positions as a Republican that because they make themselves competitive with the Republicans and they don't get down to who's better it delivering these things a lot of people still believe that Democrats\nAre better managing government than the than the Republicans are so but at the Democratic party was a direction but it's going and just the opposite direction they're almost virtually guaranteeing a reelection of a of a Donald Trump in two thousand twenty by my making themselves so marginal so crazy so\nUh you know out there that they just are revolting to most you know decent law abiding American citizens\nWell in it and you have a situation where the former attorney general\nFor the the chief law enforcement officer advocated violence ... it's it's ... and it's disgusting\nSo he advocates violence or Hillary Clinton says you can't beat civil with people who want to destroy your your beliefs\nAre so they are two fairly important people in the Democratic party\nThose are so but at the Democratic party was going on a direction but it's going and just the opposite direction they're almost virtually guaranteeing a the reelection of a of a Donald Trump and two thousand twenty by my making themselves so ... so crazy so\nAh you know out there that they just are revolting to most you know decent law abiding American citizens\nWell in it and you have a situation where the former attorney general\n... the ... the the chief law enforcement officer advocate violence\n... and it's disgusting\nSo he advocated violence a Hillary Clinton says you can't be civil with people who want to destroy your your beliefs\nSo they are two fairly important people in the Democratic party had Dianne Feinstein um claim that her office didn't leak this confidential document I don't know she lake dinner over\nYeah yeah yeah from the ... let me give you that historical analogy if I may plays\nIs that in the late sixties the radical left was you know the colleges campuses where a flame uh the radical out being funded by the KGB and the G R U which has historically documented proof the Soviets were funding the ah anti war protests of the sixties is that they became crazier and crazier and more touchy more touch\nAnd what happened was was that they temporarily took over the Democratic party and they came up with a nominee George McGovern who was a lunatic and who got you know creamed by Richard Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two\n... so the Democrats swore that weren't going to happen again so they they took control of the party and and nominated a centrist Jimmy Carter and won the Republican the Democratic party has now spinning out of control again as it did in ah sixty eight\nVirtually assuring that they're going to nominate a very extreme left is a Marxist Democrat who Trump will have an easy time defeating in two thousand twenty\nDo you think that because as mass immigration and social media there is more of a chance of the country embracing that left wing radical ideology than it was Nineteen Seventy two\nNo three social media is just the opposite you know we we we it is taken power this is part of the reason why\nThe left as so enraged because they are losing power and authority the Washington Post is a sad joke of itself let's face it the New York times is sad joke CBS NBC ABC I Can't remember the last time I watched any programming on any of those three networks except for a football games\nAre on a on Sundays on to the to the networks are but I don't know anybody who does is that their power is draining away too you know the lowering them show and the Fox news and two of you know Newsmax and one American news and\nConservative talk radio and blogs and and so they become more and more and rage and become more and more marginal and doing just the opposite there were telling their marginal viewers Marshall readers marginal listeners and send them send them all through the Republican Party which day by day is looking more calm and placid\nAt a reasonable just because of the craziness of the Democrats\nSo it's important than that the president himself a I think appear common this storm don't you agree with that and\nI wrote Donald Trump's image is set for the American people you know he can't he can't really altered or change it or what but but one thing they do believe is\nIs that he's done a pretty good job as president certainly better than bronco bomb and certainly better than Hillary Clinton would have done he's got a chance to improve his standing as as you know people uh you know\nTalk radio ... blocks and and so they become more and more and rage they become more and more marginal and they're doing just the opposite there were telling their marginal viewers Marshall readers marginal listeners and send them send them all through the Republican Party which day by day is looking more calm and laugh at\nAt a reasonable just because of the craziness of the Democrats\nSo it's important than that the president himself a I think appear calm and the storm don't you agree with that and\nI wrote Donald Trump's image is set for the American people you know he can't he can't really altered or change up or what but but one thing they do believe\nIs is that he's done a pretty good job as president certainly better than bronco bomb and certainly better than Hillary Clinton would have done he's got a chance to improve his standing as as you know people uh you know a job approval and things like that as a ... economy can prove North Korea ISIS other things like this\nUh but it stand is pretty well fish but it's it's in he's in better shape\nThan the Democrats are worth a are at this point in time\nSo go go back and this goes back to the historical moment in we talked about this a bit last night since you're Reagan biographer are so many great Reagan bucks how Reagan dealt with the the riots and will will play a bit of sound a lot of you who missed the show last night let's listen\nTo those people told you four days in advance that if the universities to head with that construction they were going to physically destroy the university who in many negotiate what she said what is\nThe first season public institution that's right but the universe is its own community in the community in Berkeley the live around all\nOf them began the first time some of you know better and are old enough to know better let young people think that they have the right to choose the law they would say as long as they were doing it in the name of social protest\nHe gets up any leads yeah yeah that point what do you know construction he was talking about\nOh there there was a there was a park there in Berkeley and they left to want to do a a build some type of bizarre a memorial to a Vietnam vet north Viet Cong soldier so that if she was completely out of control it was just it was basically the left you know a stickler thumb and the ... which is what it was all about\nBut what I Love about Reagan or old friend Marty Anderson who's to say that Ronald Reagan was he said warmly ruthless and if you listen to Iraq and he says these professors somebody if you're old enough and ought to know better you know the way he just dismiss them but so smoothly and so clearly and so\nYou know a ruthlessly but it just it was the master of this type of thing\nAnd I I just I Love the fact\nThat he he he he went right to the ... the salient point here Craig which is that if people are led to believe that there outrage or their emotions\nCan justify any conduct their behavior then we're in big trouble after ... ... it's a huge huge problem\nSure but it is situational ethics and that's the difference today between the modern Democratic Party in the modern liberal movement in modern American conservatism is is that you know rule of law is one thing where is is that the rule of the mob is quite another by the way this idea that are over on CNN you can't use the word mop look up what Webster I tweeted out this morning\nWebster's Dictionary ... a ... a a describes a mob as being an unruly group of people set about to cause a political upheaval but that's what they've been doing for the last several weeks was exactly that so you can call them up because\nWhich is that if people are led to believe that there outrage or their emotions can justify any conduct their behavior then we're in big trouble after ... that it's a huge huge problem\nSure but it is situational ethics and that's the difference today between the modern Democratic Party in the modern liberal movement in modern American conservatism is is that you know rule of law is one thing where is is that the rule of the mob is quite another by the way this idea that are over on CNN you can't use the word mob look up what Webster I tweeted out this morning\nWebster's Dictionary ... a ... a a describes a mob as being an unruly group of people set about to cause a political uh people but that's what they've been doing for the last several weeks is exactly that so you can call them up because you're offended by the Webster's Dictionary [laughter]\nYeah I agree with the mob wanted the Tea Party when they're dressed in period garb yeah and that's\nWhy the left doesn't get it because they're incapable most people on the left is that they they're they don't they ... they think in a linear sense and they think well if the Tea Party at a protest and the liberals had a protest they must be one of the same no they're not one of the same motives has everything to do with it\nNow and it's again it's feeling feeling is enough\nYeah as long as they feel and they're on the right side then that's all you need so if you feel like well you you if you want to want to stand up for women in algae BT and all it then you then you got to go out and vote Democrat like what\nYeah but but that maybe I've said this before in the show I beg your part of a hat but the difference today between moderate conservative leader modern conserve politician in modern liberal politician is the liberal politician\nGoes before the voters says give me power so I can do good things for you and some voters go oh geez I felt pretty good you know it but it but a moderate conservative ... that's an emotional response because because liberals going to do with the good things for you a moderate conservative politician goes before the voters says\nGive me power so I may give it\nBack to you\nHave to think about it you have to go through the intellectual discipline to realize what he's talking about which is a Republican form of government conservatism federalism\nHowever whatever iteration of that comes in is that but it's about taking power away from Washington and send it back to the states or localities and ultimately the individual or the frame or some founders intended it to be there in the first place\nAgain power to power to the people the let me try to show up that slogan but they never really ... but that's\nThe that's the Latin basis for the republic\nPower to the people stays with them not some some big nameless faceless bureaucracies a critic I Want to play one more thing fee then we're out of time now
