I could you know you guys will earn ... coal producing a credential thank you very much appreciate it I Want to get only gets aloof before your next comedy own Lou you we've never we skim the services you tell us about\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah yeah yeah doubts version and now\nQuestion first Steve how did you happen to come up with the idea of writing a book about the woman who wrote Shakespeare work\nWell it's a long story but I'll Try to make it really short\nOf the idea of where it's got lots of my head after we did a family tour of Stratford upon Avon Shakespeare's home and all that kind of stuff in the end of the tour of the young guys that you know there's some people think that maybe a woman wrote him a fake spears place because of the them an image or\nHave a hard thing so she said to maybe you know some people think maybe it was his wife Anne Hathaway\nSo that was just kind of a little seed that got planted and then I read an article about Amelia dishonor who was the ... in this book a real woman and and it talked about how there were so many parallels between her life and the chronology\nThe idea of writing a book about the woman who wrote some of Shakespeare work\nWell it's a long story but I'll Try to make it really short\nOr the idea of where it's got lodged in my head\nAfter we did a family tour of Stratford upon Avon and Shakespeare's home and all that kind of stuff in the end of the tour of this young tour guide said you know there's some people think that maybe a woman wrote some of Shakespeare's plays because of all of the salmon imagery I have a hard time saying that\nSo she said to maybe you know some people think maybe it was his wife and a half away\nSo that was just kind of little seed that got planted and then I read an article about Amelia dishonor who was of attacking us and this book a real woman and and I talked about how there are so many parallels between\nHer life and the chronology of Shakespeare's plays and then after the name Henry the name Amelia was the most frequently occurring character and it takes place\nAnd then I thought to myself well what about Anne Hathaway turns out she was illiterate so unless he was really good at randomly throwing words onto a page to come out with great drama it was unlikely to be her\nSo I began to research it and then I began to see all the connections including the fact that she spent three years of her life in Venice he was the daughter of of the nation musician was recruited by hand with the aid and she spent three years in Venice and her three years in Venice\nAll of the plays that are set in northern Italy were written or in the year immediately after those include the tanning through two gentlemen Rona merchant of Venice or so you know it's\nNot just I saw all these connections and I thought somebody needs to really explore this that's how I jumped into this was just all by accident really\nAnd and so therefore I'm uh I Want to go I Want to sort of take that theme of how people do things okay go ahead Julie sell are you able to prove it\nBut there's a lot of data it's all based on data and you can't prove anything that happened that long ago or so you can just there's more circumstantial evidence that points to ameliorate the sign of writing most of his comedy's Santa Shakespeare\nSoap to Blake in Kaylee\nRelated that theme um I'm gonna try to connect this sort of an away so he too I'm\nFrom the what you teach at ASU this donor you you we both use the word critical predictive analytics I was assuming that that somewhat involved and some of the work you do you refer to the hurricane last show is an example of being able to search the a circumstance tried to figure out the best way to near mostly dealing with engineering type people but you you pick a different approach to\nHow you do it it sounds like so so is there a way to\n... rid of the Steve ... book is there something that you do that would relate to Steve's discovery of Shakespeare's true writer ... there's some connection and that for you\nGet so Steve mentioned data so what we do is look at data do make predictions and so maybe there's enough data\nTo do only give you probably that's the thing most probably you know this is the case that they ... ... what's the name Amelia beside of it means they have a son though was the right to\nAt least at listening to you at ... all these bludgeon them in is in all of them take place in Italy yes\nLet me ask ... from a legal standpoint since that's now you're curfew over maybe [laughter]\nIt sounds like so so is there a way to ... the greater the Steve's book because there's something that you do that would relate to Steve's discovery of Shakespeare's true writer ... there's some connection and that for you\nGet so Steve mentioned data so what we do is look at data do make predictions and so maybe there's enough data\nTo do only give you probably that's the thing most probably you know this is the case that the Emilio ... what's the name Amelia beside of media blitz on though was the right to\nAn ... listening to you at all these budget Newman is and all of them take place in Italy yes\nLike let me ask ... from a legal standpoint\nSince that's now you're curfew of it may be at risk standpoint is there some way that legal fixing to what Steve doing did with his book [noise] yeah I think maybe not\nNecessarily um the field currently but I mean certainly could draw connections with criminal law I'm you know you're you're really trying to uncover a story I mean I I'm doing a number of probate right now I'm with someone passes away\nIt's really detective work to see what what they owned and and I'm gathering all that all that data and put it together and then you have to file with the court so I'm a less less exciting a detective work\nBut Killian raises so relieved that\nIs really active work involved in the Swiss 'cause you're involved is what a foundation those called yet politically is a Swiss foundation is there is some detective work or or how how do you relate to the discovery that that both play compete you've talked about what do you did with his book on Shakespeare's Shakespeare's consider spirit or\nWell I don't know about detective work but I Would say that Steve as you explained um that you you had this jumping off point that you learned about that um potential um\nWriter um for who wrote under shake their name and you kind of jumped off can be found something that looked interesting to you and cliff we provide opportunity to try lots of different new thing for our kids because\nUm the kids at work that don't necessarily have lots of opportunities to try new things like swimming hiking canoeing um and we want to give them a little taste of all of it they might find something that they get to be really passionate about and ended up writing about\nOh I'm Sorry we kind of path that but when we're talking with Blake I I was thinking that well we could or maybe do a story on Shakespeare not having an estate planning you here [laughter]\nThat's a great that's great I Know that's\nThe connection there that by one stretching for and I wanted to get there early\nBut Lew us something interesting interesting speaking of that in Shakespeare's will doesn't mention a word about any of the plays that are attributed to him\nSo should have made a better estate planner well what the question is why did that not occur OK okay why did that and I don't really I mean I mean well I don't have a theory about that but I'm just saying is that one of the curious things\nI'm In his name the only shows up five places and he never spelled his name the same way twice so that it never the way we spell it today but anyhow I Want to come back to the to for a minute because I'm a this really gets to jumping off point to connect in with something that is a Haley talked about\nI Do some mentoring for an organization called the challenge founder and what they do is they identify very bright academically oriented hardworking\nKids in terrible schools okay and that and through the schools they get referred to the challenge foundation to get into schools that can really develop their potential\nOur state planner well what the question is why did that not occur OK okay why did that and I don't really I mean I mean well I don't have a theory about that but I'm just saying it's one of the curious\nThings are in his name only shows up five places and he never spelled his name the same way twice so that it never the way we spell it today but anyhow I Want to come back to the to for a minute because I'm a this really gets to jumping off point the connecting with something that is a Haley talked about\nI Do some mentoring for an organization called the challenge founder and what they do is they identify\nVery bright academically oriented hardworking kids in terrible schools okay and that and through the schools they get referred to the challenge foundation to get into schools that can really develop their potential\nAnd they end up in private schools through scholarships and all those kinds of things to get so I'm I'm entered one one kid who is now at um scenic country day school and he's super interested in robotics\nOr he's I think in eighth grade now and I yeah he's actually a families are refugees from Iran\nAnd another student I Am mentoring his name as she and his family as refugees from\nA Nepal and on he was a great kid he brought up in the studio and record\nAnd these are short of shy trying to work their way and she goes to Rosie\nHow if they're interested in and the kinds of things that you are the people in a ask you and your faculty in your department do how could they reach out to somebody there and say hey I just like to come in and talk to you for half\nHour\n... they're going to each other to me okay because I Know the whole [noise]\nDid you see that microphone attack me I just go ahead go ahead ... because the and the all of the people in my department are much school and a whole bunch of people who are doing robotics including I Do a little too\nAnd so yeah that can reach out to me and that can add to figure out what is is that it will be interested in and if I'd gone to them and put them to someone has\nTo find them email you yeah okay well what does your contact information right now is if you're talking about what's your contact information\n[laughter] I have a very nice way to reach out to you or to at ASU dot edu yeah okay good although the IT lady easy they beat today how are you really want\nBut the problem is I don't want to read all the ...\nOf my head all\nGo through you or something that\nWe All right well the things you talked about a ... a previous show I Believe was just um\nThe most of the most young people they're not going towards ... most American young people are not going towards engineering you you have to get an international could to international kids I mean Americans are probably going forward tech in some form of the right to the Gulf of Silicon Valley or something is that what they're mostly going for what they're going for\nIt so at the undergraduate level to show enough that you know they're coming to engineering or maybe it's just lots of undergraduate students from ... from you if I'm at is on a couple of what happens\nBy the time they get a bachelor's degree they\nDon't compete well enough in a way to go on to get a PHD and so on really top notch to go to ... you got to be top notch ... and the top notch students tend to go in to eat the science of like physics and math all tend to go into becoming a doctor or a law\nYoung people they're not going towards that most American young people are not going towards engineering you you have to get an international could Ashville kids I mean American get you're probably going for tech in some form or the right that they're going for Silicon Valley or something that what they're mostly going for what are they going for\nIt so that the ... that good evidence showing that they ended up coming to engineering and maybe it's a lot so I like that you love them from you on its own of what happened\nBy the time they get it back to the degree they\nI I've always uh just had a a love for writing and reading um I used to be a hip hop a DJ at a nightclub in Illinois for for a while so I Love music as well just a wide variety of music and I like to get lost I\nYou're talking about Firesign Theater earlier as some of their finals in my in my office to office I have a a bunch of my records and finals Tom Waits and Frank Zappos\n'em ups are probably my favorite favorite things to\nSo it's it's funny you say that I'm going to read the ... relate this\nKind of threw you in ... and also clearly 'cause you guys who you of a certain age and the two is dealing with a certain age group [laughter] I'm a musically and other things that we've\nSociety is sort of taken a turn a ... some of those who are older you know we had the sixties seventies eighties and even in a little bit in the nineties where whether we would the transition was maybe from rock and in and do\n... rock expanded involvement all of a sudden a disco was sort of a it's still a list of all kind of you know kind of goofy but it is fun kind of period and all of a sudden rap came in and it and it's kind of dominated in in most and then the music industry changed\nOr so you guys were listening standpoint and ... to from a technology standpoint or a technology has changed how businesses are done how music has done ... how you make money from these different things first of all the listening standpoint\nWhat do you have like you said you have multiple tastes music you go back apparently Katie where are you at that\nI don't think Detroit fan so you go way back yeah yeah so are you an unusual in your generation or or is that oh what what how do you guys see yourself within your generation which I ... I guess right or yeah I Me personally\nMy mom claims to be the first hippie ever [laughter] she's seen\nHundreds and hundreds of concerts and a growing up on the weekends and it was time to clean the house and we would take turns picking on vinyl and when I was a kid I Choose to pick the the most uh pretty pretty album cover with the most pictures and colors um and then she would always take a turn and you know I just got introduced to a lot of sixty\nPoint or a technology has changed how business is done how music is done how how you make money from these different things you first of all the listening standpoint what do you have a bleak already said you have multiple taste music you go back apparently Katie where are you at that I'm a\nI'm a big ... fan so you go way back yeah yeah so are you an unusual and your generation or or is that oh what do you how do you guys see yourself within your generation which I ... I guess right or yeah I Me personally\nMy mom claims to be the first hippie ever [laughter] she's seen\nHundreds and hundreds of concerts and a growing up on the weekends and it was time to clean the house and we would take turns picking on vinyl and when I was a kid I Choose to pick the the most uh pretty pretty album cover with the most pictures and colors um and then she would always take a turn and ah you know I just got introduced to\nA lot of sixties seventies music I mean just fell in love with it\nReally helps you real quick yeah I think my parents definitely influence that um I think\nSeeing that the kids these days I got the old saying that uh I think a lot of music nowadays has a lot to do with social media um and how how people are able musicians or musicians\nQuote unquote are able to portray themselves are kind of this jockeys mostly they're basically taking it boosts them and do it now I go to my health club and I just hear nothing but not techno seems a lot of seems kinda kindergarten to me in terms of lyrics\nAnd music it doesn't seem like it's it's certainly not classical than the extent of what you have a similar view on that or what you got\nYeah I I actually at the whenever I used to DJ I used to use vinyl records and I used to actually spin them er which I Know that's not really a musical and a lot of eyes but I'm the club took a transition to they want someone to push buttons and knew a lot of techno music\nI quit that day um I'll forget principles I guess yeah yeah I did and then uh\nYou know today I don't really listen to a lot of modern hip hop and a lot of the artist today their their faces look like or\nThe desks and detention with all the uh tattoos on their faces and I just don't get into it uh so\nMy ... but I just ah discovered three of singers that are Katie's age\nWho of course ... who who for some reason\nHave incorporated the park ... from the greatest singers like Frank Sinatra but their lyrics are current\n\nBut isn't that a form of musical south in if they're incorporating it again this kind of what to me were rep became you take somebody else's music and then you put lyrics to\nNo no this is their own compositions that are being orchestrated on the quality level of a Frank Sinatra presentation\nThat sounds interesting so I'm Glad to hear that occasionally speaking of music do you use music in any way with\nThe children who are involved with a lift you\nYeah um we have a lot of dance parties ah after every meal there the dance party and ah we cheering it's not typical music if you will but\nI'm cheering and getting excited for anything and everything is a big deal for our kids because um we we want to bring joy I'm into their lives into the lives of everybody who is around us and um the kids will cheer for\nLiterally everything even we have special song about grilled cheese and tomato soup because we love we love food and grilled cheese and tomato super exciting so we get the good things about\nThe ... thing with your contract is Michigan when when I get to be two in the next thing we can we get your contact information real fast yeah you can check out our Web site at swift youth dot org\nAnd uh and they\nIn any way with children who are involved with with you\nYeah um we have a lot of dance parties\nUh after every meal there the dance party and ah we\nCheering it's not typical music but I'm cheering and getting excited for anything and everything is a big deal for kids because um we want to bring joy I'm into their lives in the lives of everybody who is around us and um the kids will cheer for\nLiterally everything even we have settled song about grilled cheese and tomato soup because we love we love food and grilled cheese and tomato super exciting so we get the good things about\n... and get your contract is Michigan about when I get to ... to in the next thing we can we get your contact information real fast yeah you can check out our Web site at swift youth dot org\nAnd uh and they therefore helping kids at risk of or get metro right basically yeah OK perfect\nIn fundraising is always an issue for you guys out yup we have to go one more commercial break I think we got one more segment left is that right oh my gosh we go faster\nOr we are the ... you know reporters Bob fishermen along with ... and we've had our three special guest ... to Blake and clearly and we'll be right back for a final segment rate of ...

Want to ah introduce you to Lisa Johnson\nBlack horse who is the chair of our Native American carcass Lisa welcome to the program [noise] [noise]\nHi I'm good I'm good\nI um have decided that um I get kind of frustrated nice and maybe I should bother with this radio program people don't call in and whatnot but everybody's always asking me will wind hello to have it at a decent time you know so we're going to have to try to do something about that\nEspecially those of us on my show with yeah yeah\nWell I got to Iraq and Iran didn't bring you off the menu Larry ... yeah I got caught in the ... south yeah fat\nAnd it's a beautiful drive on the ... that's true I ... but yeah I have\nTo sneak into back way today a palm lane because for some\nReason I say I'm third yeah yeah mhm Lisa I had\nBeen wanting to get a you on this program for at least a year or because I think one of the things that we make lack as institutions and organization than even talk shows is our Native American community\nAnd um I I hear periodically during democratic shows about all the problems that there are\nIn your uh communities and uh and your problems aren't really that much different from other children's problems because our kids get drugged out an intoxicated and what have you but\nTrue I ... but yeah yeah\nI have to sneak in the back way today a Paul Mooney because for some\nReason I cannot stand on third yeah yeah mhm [noise]\nLisa I've been wanting to get a you on this program for at least a year [noise] ah because I think one of the things that we make lack\nAs institutions and organization than even talk shows is our Native American community [noise] and um I I hear periodically during democratic shows about all the problems that there are\nIn your um communities and uh and your problems aren't really that much different from other children problem because our kids get drugged out intoxicated and what have you but nobody seems to be helping with these issues [noise]\nSo uh I Want you to just talk about what's happening in your community and what kind of problems facing and\nWhat does this election mean to you\n[noise]\nWell ... and on one correction I no longer the chair of the\nArizona Democratic Party numerical cock is I'm actually the secretary my Senator Kyl who's sitting here with me is now the chair on hello [laughter]\nWell when I was in the military they tell me you know once you're a surgeon you're a sergeant once you're happy and you're a captain you forever so [laughter]\nOh that's so true but I'm really proud that he is that and I I find that\nI'm helping guide him but I think the important aspect and I and I apologize for not coming on sooner but I Do think this is a a conversation that we can continue there and we will but actually has been\nAnd have a lot of 'em get coverage on the fact it lady Americans do not have what we have this traditional street address [noise] no I'm just have to look at what's going to discuss with Mr I've had it had only um\nChanged that whole mentality that a P o clock is not an adequate\nAddress so I Know that um for my own tribal ID I have used it the last time voting\nAnd they did except that um I also heard from other people that are in the past it was not an easy um what was the number two questions\nHealthcare oh health care\nOr were actually that we have Indian Health service here however\nUh North Dakota has had a lot of um media coverage on the fact that a lot of lady Americans do not have what we have this traditional street address it [noise] so um this is something that I was going to discuss with Mr far tests\nHow to me um\nChange that whole mentality that a P o clock\nIs not an adequate address so I Know that um for my own tribal ID I have used it the last two times voting\nAnd they did except that um I also heard from other people that I'm In the past it was not an easy\nUm what was the number two questions healthcare oh health care\nUm we're fortunate that we have Indian Health service here however I guess I'll just use one example is like the dental care most to me is walk in the schools and how to call was\nA lot to get a um an equipment so that's not acceptable course we always advocate to have\nMore fun for Indian Health service and\nThen that's why it's so important that we have a selected officials that actually will represent native communities that are often overlooked or\nNot talked about and the number three is education I think one of the biggest thing for reservation is however is we still have a boarding school in schools charter school for a traditional public schools\nAnd so when we have that many people\nService one reservation I think think get lost and then that's where we really look for our tribal governments\nElected official to kind of help guide us and then with elected officials that the state if that makes sense\nYeah it does I'm In you know\nI ask you these questions and it really shows my ignorance about what's happening and that's I mean that's why I Want to know and frankly I think all our listeners probably would like to know\nSo I Will be inviting you guys back not just you but anyone else you want to bring out here\nAnd ah I think you know we see all the cowboy pictures and all of that sort of snow but I think we need a real documentary made of how you have been treated\nAnd yet you\nRespect and love this country and I can't tell you how many Native Americans have served in our military and given up their lives I I just think America needs to be in light and\nAnd ah frankly I mean if you know of any good books I'd like to be in light into 'cause uh I think it's horrible what we have done to Native Americans as the people and what we've done to their communities\nBut that's just me you know so\nAnyway um there is one thing that I Would like to ask you would just them aside is are there any good resources you know that we could a book or something that we could purchase somewhere if we wanted to or not only educate ourselves but also share it with our grandchildren\nSo that they um the no\nWell I Would love to work on a less to share next time but however I think for right now for the election you can go to Trey hunt\nAnd that P. R. A.\nH. A. N. T. reports on Facebook\nI think it's\nHorrible what we have done to Native Americans as the people and what we've done to their communities oh\nBut that's just me you know so\nAnyway um there is one thing that I Would like to ask you would just them aside is are there any good resources you know that we could a book or something that we could purchase somewhere if we wanted to or not only educate ourselves but also share it with our grandchildren\nSo that they um no\nWell I Would love to work on a leg to share lots of time but however I feel for right now for the election you could go ... trading hot and that can be art ha\nHa ... reports on Facebook ... he wrote me dealing alive report on election night and you can only go throughout the year for I'm\nCovering the election and made a country and that would be a really good source start understanding what's happening with the ... and all our Kennedy\nYeah and also another thing is don't do things that just because you're not a guest on a particular program that you cannot call in here you can call in here anytime and share information with us because frankly\nI think we need to ... ... educate each other about what's going on in the various communities\nI mean I may not know what's going on in the Latino community but that's just by accident I wasn't born Latino and I may not know what's going on in Native American community but that's just by accident I wasn't born Native American\nSo we have to educate each other\nAbsolutely\nOkay thank you for calling and by the way we have a ban car Mitchell here with us he's running to be a state senator my home district the sixteen and he is obsessed with education I thought there were no nobody more acts up says to me but he is\n[laughter] well thank you for that I I'm not I'm not sure about it I'm obsessed but uh no that's a good thing I think one of the things that people don't realize is the key to a great economy is er K. twelve education program\nAnd um and in this state you know with the ... ah with this charter private school experiment you know public funding ... charter and private schools\nI'm Sorry no keep going okay well I I think um you know it's it's a\nSteep going psycho and sorry I I I'm not used to be on the radio read that's okay I guess we all learned since [laughter] okay so your hat [laughter]\n\nSo um you know in addition to education though uh you know closing corporate tax loopholes I think is a high priority and um and that'll give us some ... some of the money that we need to fund education of course you need to protect our environment or our current legislatures working backwards there\nAnd ah and of course great strong policies or protect our water\nBecause they don't tell us about three or five up a ... three or five is\nIs a disaster for our our public education system\nOr you know what it does is it will take 'em or\nYou know the existing you say a voucher program and ... basically make it available for all the children in the states so special needs kids and a recent article came out actually in the\nArizona Republic\nAre talked about a private vouchers and and it showed that I'm a these vouchers\nAnd um and then I'll give it some some of the money that we need to fund education of course you need to protect our environment or our current legislatures working backwards there and ah and of course great strong policies or protect our water because\nThey don't tell us about three or five\nUp ... through five is is a disaster for our our public education system\nOr you know what it does is it will take a a\nYou know the existing you say a voucher program and ... basically make it available for all the children's state says it's special needs kids and a recent article came out actually in the\nArizona Republic\nWhich are talked about a private vouchers and it showed that um these vouchers benefit rich kids are well to do kids much more than they do a four\nAnd and it's the kids that don't need the help it's the kids whose mommy and daddy is very well do you know I mean I'm always amazed when Koch brothers and and the the bosses and all these people say well we need help for what you know how much money can you possibly need\nOn somebody's private schools are very expensive and you're looking at twenty to twenty six thousand dollars in tuition and at that voucher will knock off a in some cases fourteen thousand\nMaybe they need to go to a public school and and learn how to integrate with other children who are not as well off\nYou know you know a lot of people um they don't uh\nRemember back in Nineteen Ninety four our state was fourteen and education ... ranked fourteenth mhm and that's before the charters in private school you know speak started to become funded by public money um and and it's gone downhill from there and that but they can't want to keep doing this big experiment than just expand it more\n... it's ... it's called segregation we don't want our darling is to get ... by the net nasty masses you know\nThat could be [laughter] see\nBut you know I Want to know I mean we are kids used to go to a Catholic school and it was just for their religion but we always paid every increase in public education and we were always there for public education\nAnd I grew up and remember in Catholic school parents I went to public schools parents raised Catholic\nAnd the Catholic school parents were very particular about the fact that\nThey wanted to pay for their kids that exploration because they wanted her kids to have a religious education ... and that that secular schools where the public school and I never heard anyone complaining about no taxes for the gold I mean it was just something you accept that now when you sent your kids to a parochial school that had what I recall so\nAnd there's some very exactly and the other thing too is you weren't\nAs far as some of the past there that I had you weren't really paying for the education what you were paying for was the support of the church so that your children could get that religious education in addition to the regular education\nAnd ... to go on to say like Notre Dame are yeah now I Catholic er institution of higher learning that right yeah show and sort of pride in LA and\nAnd now they want a free ride on our taxes well it doesn't work that way taxes are for all the children in America whose parents may not be able to afford you know the bells and whistles\nRight and that and again another point is that there's no oversight whatsoever that the worst part and we can't we can't see where the money's going we we can see how much\nWeren't as far as some of the pastors that I had you weren't really paying for the education what you were paying for was the support of the church so that your children could get that religious education in addition to the regular education\nAnd energy authentic go on it saying like Notre Dame are yeah now I Am a Catholic institution of higher learning that right yeah now I'm sort of\nPride in LA and and now they want a free ride on our taxes well it doesn't work that way exes are\nFor all the children in America whose parents may not be able to afford you know the bells and whistles\nRight and that and again another point is that there is no oversight whatsoever that the worst part and we can't we can't see where the money's going we we can see\nHow much we spend on a ... but we don't know which schools are getting about ... there's no uh no oversight at all and especially in our side too I'm ...\nA is a perhaps the most important they pay for one a given that outlawed dirty money and invest in that which we had also indoors then supported\nOur knocked off the ballot but thrill five is really the central one uh that were concerned with and getting are union members to vigorously support\nYet I they had three or five\nIs is so\nUgly it is a total lie and they tried to say well you know it I mean red printed supports this and that doesn't\nYou know I I again the election season is horrible is there anything else that are organized labor is making a big push on\nWell of course the single biggest pushes geo TV yeah our national unions and International Union have been a flying into Arizona with a support members are that are on a release time and we're doing a labor to labor\nMember to member get out the vote effort\nAnd uh it's really the uh\nThe largest a political a mobilization that we've seen in Arizona for labor in years and years and years\nAnd the notion is that we have an obligation for our members to participate and to uh of course we're all we're nonpartisan having said that we're exclusively about outcomes\nAt positive outcomes and solutions are and that means getting to the balls that means getting our members are to uh to pick their early ballots and now of course and to make a commitment and a promise that they're going to be there on that debris\nUnions have been a flying into Arizona with a support members are that are on a release time and we're doing a labor to labor member to member get out the vote effort and uh it's really the uh\nThe largest a political a mobilization that we've seen in Arizona for labor in years and years and years and the notion is that we have an obligation for our members to participate and to ah of course\nWe're all we're nonpartisan having said that we're exclusively about outcomes\nAnd positive outcomes and solutions are and that means getting to the balls that means getting our members are to uh to pick their early ballots and now ... and to make a commitment no promise that they're going to be there on a ...\nYou know power one thing I heck I've been labor's since I was old enough to walk I think was probably\nAt least anyway one of those things the labor has always done is it's turned out its members to vote because we understand that the right to vote is not only precious to us as far as making sure that people are elected who will protect our rights but also\nIt's it's a democracy thing you you cannot have a democratic country unless you protected by voting\nSo are are are is organized labor going to be out there I'm\nFrom here till November six going to be out there pushing our people to vote\nAbsolutely were canvassing a seven days a week we've got phone banks going onto our members a gang seven days a week or down in Tucson in southern Arizona where are federation is\nEven as I'm driving towards the the the Arizona right now in Phoenix or to do a geo TV a session we have several of our doors candidates that will be their meeting our members and are helping them or understand or as endorsed candidates their commitment to labor\nAnd the uh the rash of prosperity is that we've got to get our doors candidates elected but ah the brilliant thing is we had so far I agree Brady\nA national vice president of AFL CIA oh at a hour of that or at a at a get out the vote rally last Saturday in Tucson with David ... the uh\nUm and uh uh Richard Lee is the chair of our supervisors board down here and ... of course longtime friend of labor a staunch supporter and the\nUm and just a couple of weeks prior Richard Trumka right\nAt oh I missed that one I really wanted to go to that so bad\nIt was fabulous uh it was a of course a standing room only and\nAnd and the intention and your your your listeners would do this and I know you do to the intention is by having a these are very high profile very a vigorous a supporters coming into town it drives the attention of our national unions and our national partners\nTo concentrate on Arizona which again I Know all the listeners know Arizona's a battleground state and\nIt is a battleground state as long as we're in that fight we'll do our friends and if you see a good fight and the fight now is to get people to the polls week didn't win because our issues are communities issues we can win if we can get our members and our friends and neighbors to Paul\nPaul one of those things that aggravates me no end is the fact that our people listen to the television and they get blown away by the smoke and mirrors but the simple fact is look look\nWe do this and I know you do to the intention is by having\nA these are very high profile very a vigorous a supporters coming into town it drives the attention of our national union that our national partners to concentrate on Arizona which again I Know all the listeners know Arizona's a battleground state\nIt is a battleground state as long as we are in that fight will reign or rather than if you see a good bike [noise] and and the right now is to get people to the polls we didn't win because our issues or communities issues we can win if we can get our members and our friends and neighbors to Paul\nPaul one of those things that aggravates me no end is the fact that\nOur people listen to the television and they get blown away by the smoke and mirrors but the simple fact is look look look at the shots are trying to take at David Garcia\nAnd oh well I saved education and blah blah blah and David Garcia stands for this and that yeah but it doesn't tell you that do see and I'm mixed silly and all these other candidates that they have are trying to destroy\n[noise] excuse me trying to destroy Social Security Medicare Medicaid they're trying to do away with the a living wage they're trying to do away with everything that really is important to our working families\nWorking families and and you you know the monitor that we that we say the people that

topic uh we do the garage challenge last week we talked about\nHow we're dealing with certain reviews and the biggest thing that we put out there was\nThe review that you don't have an opportunity to answer and yes the bad reviews you know we're very transparent in our garage we don't have many Susie but when we don't have the opportunity to answer and they just leave a bad review an off they go\nThat hurts it does hurt and we we like the good reviews too but the bad ones we um we get feedback and that is great feedback for it and so we want to know what we did wrong so we can actually have to fix it\nI mean we're normal people man that's where we grow our business and you know we have I mean the majority are bad I mean we've got thousands of good reviews but if you're listening get on a ranch nation Facebook every Wednesday we pose a grudge challenge even if you're not a garage or maybe you're younger mechanic so we're going to get right into it let's introduce a Mr\nCar shop ... are shot Mr Clinton's big daddy battering in Studio ... factions\nPale crafts crafts good to have a ... nation today and you are and you've\nBeen on before and I think you got you got a little following going on in the car show falling\nWe try we try we just want to take care of people fix people's cars going back on the road make everybody happy\nWe said earlier it's not rocket science that was a commercial ranking view when civil and commercial uh we're talking used car a trick or is this camps but before we do let's not qualify you Mr Chris boundaries of the people know who you be we didn't just find you on the street so it's a little background of miss Chris about\nI've been on in the automotive industry for Thirty years now and started flipping tires when I was Fifteen Years old change in oil moved up to big heavy line workshop and motors became an AFC certified technician I'm manage shops for many years and then I brash and on my own my own location\nYeah that was an easy I mean you said a mouthful and we get a lot of younger up and coming a automotive technicians and mechanics um before we dive into the used car topic what advice would you give to a younger tech that's coming up\nWork hard putting the hours a lot of sixty Seventy hour work week so that when I was coming up in the industry will learn how to do everything as efficiently as possible and properly it's hot possible if you have to fix the cart twice you're losing money so fix it right the first time put the right parts on do the extra distance to make sure\nIt comes out like it should be like brand new\nBride no I Love that if in fact man if that was the ... if that was a monster with every garage in the country we wouldn't have all these consumer fair reports maybe that we see\nWhether I started just had a vision that when you said higher flipping I mean I'm thinking like Iron Man they they hire for training as it was that the case then flip\nEntire throwing kegs\n[laughter] yeah clipping tires keep hey we're not going to play or not Chris I imagine\nThat you you you preach in your garage have before\nWould you give to a younger tech that's coming up\nWork hard putting the hours a lot of sixty Seventy hour work week so that when I was coming up in the industry that will learn how to do everything as efficiently as possible and properly it's pot possible if you have to fix a cart twice you're losing money so fix it right the first time put the right parts on do the extra distance to make sure\nIt comes out like it should be like brand new\nBride no I Love that if in fact man if that was if that was a monster with every garage in the country we wouldn't have all these consumer fair reports maybe we'll see\nWhether I started just had a vision that when you said higher flipping I mean I'm thinking like Iron Man they they hire for training as it was that the case then flip\nEntire throwing kegs\n[laughter] yeah Clinton cars keep hey we're not going to play hard now Chris I imagine\nThat you you you preach in your garage have before you get this used car bring it to me so I can check it out without a doubt why I mean why should somebody like I Know what I'm looking at ...\nWho wants to sell who's selling a car that's in great condition nobody wakes up says my cars being good it's running good everything's fine I Want to get rid of it but that's what the ads that most people get rid of cars because they know that there's something wrong because they've been to the shop they were told their car needs\nThis or that done where it's five hundred thousand Fifteen hundred dollars and they said well instead of putting this money into it\nI'll sell it as a great car\nAnd the next person buying it still has to do that work on top of buying the car\nThat's that's the psychology right I mean you hit it on a nutshell you think people are not hip to that do you think they just buy a on the on the Internet or these used cars and not realize that somebody selling this for a reason\nWell it's hard everybody's got a budget I remember you know you only have so much money that you anticipate on spending on car which is fine if you if you get a car that either pre certified or it's been looked at by a mechanical technician and you know what you're getting into\nYour Suzie uh we've had a few of these cars and the show\nFrankly just had one the other day um they just bought a car a used car and uh the AC went out and so they took it back to the two they bought it from they replace states ie they had literally three days left before they could return it so they went ahead and brought it into us\nAnd we actually were able to ... we actually are recommended they return it became the turtle is going out oh gosh that's big money yes so we'd save them and they they although they were sad because they like the car yeah they were so grateful that we were able to protect their investment\nThere a lot of a lot of these cars Chris I'm well I ... just pick on the P. T. crews are in trouble why but anyway a lot of those PTA cruiser with the turtles are out there for sale\nGives the folks an idea if they are looking at a vehicle not too much mechanical knowledge what Simpson would they have if any vehicle with a turbo is like going to cause trouble are expensive how would they know\nAre very expensive what are the biggest thing I tell people when they're looking at a used car is how\nLong it lasts donor owned it for get a list of the maintenance and repair that they've done over the course of time and that kind of pushing the right direction to how well it was taking care of\nBut any case of a terrible a lot of these youngsters out there they're getting cars with troubles right their average or well I mean more than that from you too that's more and more common I knew a Ford has got over five million or those equal boosts now under the hood of Ford Explorer and expeditions what would be a symptom if somebody would\nWhile gas you'd see smoke out of the tailpipe that is the number one killer that means that terrible was pulling oil into it and burning it through the combustion chambers\nI think any smoke so let's we'd set so you guys know blue smoke is oil black smoke is gas\nExpensive how would they know are very expensive what are the biggest thing I tell people\nWhen they're looking at a used car is how\nLong it lasts donor owned it for get a list of the maintenance and repair that they've done over the course of time and\nThat kind of pushing the right direction to how well it was taking care of\nBut any case of a terrible a lot of these youngsters out there they're getting cars with troubles right their average or well I mean more than that from you too that's more and more common I knew a Ford has got over five million or those equal boosts now under the hood of Ford Explorer and expeditions what would be a symptom if somebody\nWould grab while gas you'd see smoke out of the towel pipe that is the number one killer that means that terrible was pulling oil into it and burning it through the combustion chambers\nYeah I think any smoke so let's we'd set so you guys know blue smoke is oil\nBlack smoke is gas white smoke is coolant right so if you pick up and we'll think white smoke why it's like the right Colin black is just raw fuel that could be an injector dumping or something to that effect and that blue is this burning\nOil yeah any smoke is bad smoke no Carson smoke\nNo cars should smoke especially in California Denver I don't know that the tape it might be okay but you [laughter] know very fish yeah but that's a fact of meat a lot of people don't pay attention to that when they\nThey don't people get ... get excited like buying anything anything that you get for the first time I don't want it to be the best that it can be\nLet's dive into it so in terms like ... I'm going to be the criminal pet or I'm going to sell you a car that are smoking\nYou go and used car salesman on I'm going to do the used car salesman I'll be your wife and I say no I don't buy it [laughter] but I'm listening to the car and Craig's list\nAnd whatever car doesn't matter but it did smoke and what I Do is I go down and get smoke be gone in a bottle smoke away smoke away\nYou've seen that there's such a thing yeah what we can do it is I pour this honey oil\nEssentially that's what I mean if it if you look at regular oil and it has some you know it's got some fluids to it and it brings a certain rhythm you take that hunting oil it literally comes out like honey and I want to stop this smoky car\nIt's available you can go to the parts house or their motor hunting\nMotor honey how ... how can identify like how you gonna check my trickery if I use the stop smoke\nAs an average consumer is very difficult to do you know when you pull the oil out and you have to know from what it should feel like on your fingers\nAnd pull a dip stick out and run your fingers across it is the biggest thing there's a lot of a used car inspections that we ended up doing and the first thing we look at is the oil change thicker and the windshield\nAnd it's amazing how many people are selling a car that is way overdue on an oil change which is right there that opens the book up to be at the biggest negative factor we can see coming in\nYeah I mean that's that's a little hanging fruit right there I'm going to check the sticker for just an average person or I Would add if you I mean pulling the oil deaf sick big time that's like you can tell if there's plenty of oil it's gonna feel rural tacking if\nYou will any coloration of ... that it's gone too long between oil Jane\nYeah soon as he he like you've been in the garage now for a few years prior to coming in the garage and sort of taking taking the reins you do an awesome job or give us an experience maybe in the past when you bought a used car did you have any problems before you were hooked up in the industry\nKnow what Frank I have ah let's see here I bought a new car I don't think I've ever bought a used car from a deal\nLook up to be the biggest negative factor we can see coming in\nYeah I mean that's that's a little hanging fruit right there I'm going to check the sticker for just an average person or I Would add if you I mean pulling the oil ... big time that's like you can tell if there's plenty of oil it's gonna feel rural tacking if\nYou will any coloration of ... that it's gone too long between oil Jane\nYeah soon as he he like you've been in the garage now for a few years prior to coming in the garage and sort of taking taking the reins you do an awesome job or give us an experience maybe in the past when you bought a used car did you have any problems before you were hooked up in the industry\nYou know what Frank I have ah let's see here I bought a new car I don't think I've ever bought a used car from a dealer actually no way I did I bought a used car for my kids\nMy used car for the kids and um we had um sight unseen you financing I gave my daughter's the money they were thought to check it out they didn't check it out\nSo it turns out I brought it to the garage just to do a little quick check and it was way more than it was worth that was a lot of money out with a lot of money so I just went ahead and got rid of it\nYeah so number one if you are listening you look [noise] Chris mentioned some sticker that the basic thing but let's type deeper if you've got any suspicion\nAnd it's check engine light that they've pulled out let's say they were masking vi V. T. issue that's one thing but if they were masking a catalyst efficiency fault no catalytic converter had already been all those big dollars and so you understand that that road even pleading it's precious metal that's putting these\nYeah it's not even now you bought a car that seems like it's you know five hundred and eight hundred dollars less than every other one that is for sale on Craig's list and now you need to spend Fifteen hundred dollars just to get it through emissions\nYeah no doubt a we have a few of these catalysts efficiency fall to come in the garage on on on their on their own life but still like people so the best thing to go back to their let's get into the solution\nChickens in light that has been removed know when you're kicking tires looking at the vehicle you're not going to pull the cluster but would you can do a simple thing you can do if you can offer to blend or you can do this that's turned the heat on don't start that vehicle in\nThe key on engine off to us\nRight and that's a bold test\nAnd then all of the war all the all the basic warning light should come on and then once the vehicle started they should all go off and there's a light that doesn't come on there's a reason for that\nYeah and you should be in fact I wouldn't even ask questions because you're going to get stories I just\nNow you need to spend Fifteen hundred dollars just to get it through emissions\nYeah no doubt a we have a few of these catalysts efficiency fall to come in the garage on on on their on their own life but still like people so the best thing to go back to their let's get into the solution\nChickens in light that has been removed know when you're kicking tires looking at the vehicle you're not going to pull the cluster but would you can do a simple thing you can do if you can offer to blend or you can do this that's turned the heat on don't start to vehicle in\nThe key on engine off to us\nRight and that's a bold test\nAnd then all of the war all the all the basic warning light should come on and then once a vehicle started they should all go off and there's a light that doesn't come on there's a reason for that\nYeah and you should be in fact I wouldn't even ask questions 'cause you're gonna get stories I just walk away\nRight because then my my uncle cell in the car and my cousin so right or an amateur cell in the car\nAnywhere from ... to ... [laughter] I mean I just know that people like part of what you do and when you kick in tires\nGet away from the fuzzy diets and all that ... because that's going to kind of for you and then I'm not knocking folks that do it but your job is to protect your money and if you're out there kicking tires turn to key on and checking the light should come on including the airbag light\nThat another thing that's a big deal like people don't realize now many of you saying well I could do without an airbag but if you're that mom buying a caravan airbags meet a lot and you don't know about it until there's a test on\nDown the road and we find out airbags missing\nYeah that becomes a huge problem and that's a lot of salvage restored vehicles and there again we're going to get into we're going to we're going to delve into the the importance of titles on vehicle yeah we're going to cover titled wasn't able to India and the and the acronyms that go with them and\nWrite about five and a lot of folks said well I got it inspected everything seems to be fine Chris what do you think that what what is an average that and I know there's variables but if I bought a used car\nWhat can I it's sort of expect if you will and what I'm going to put in it as car maybe over six months or maybe that first two months\nWell when I when I've learned to be the average that I tell them most of my customers and most people in general is you're going to spend a hundred dollars a month to keep a car on the road you know the first five years of owning a car you making car payments and the average car payment ours went up to four hundred and fifty four hundred and eighty dollars to buy\nA car six eight thousand a year right to an end to maintain it if\nYou spend a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars a month then that is the cheapest car payment you can have just as long as you feel safe and comfortable and the carnage reliable right every car just like everything else has a a lifespan\nAnd better it's taken care of the longer lifespan is the the longer the oil changes go the less flushes that are done the basic maintenance teeth cleaning things that aren't on time greatly shortens and reduces the life of that vehicle\nYeah no doubt Suzie before you got in the industry in a come to work for the garage did you have a any of these sort of views court situations where you bought it you drove it and then three months later there was a huge issues\nNow I'm I'm going to go back to that car that I talked about earlier because it's funny that ah Chris mentioned you know at the AC recharge it exactly what it said in the ad to\nMay ... Nathan ac recharge may need an online that may need um you know just a small thing and like I said when it came down to it it was control armed with a with everything that needed to be a replay\nDon't know I mean if you're looking at an ad whether it's I mean when\nThe the longer the oil changes go the less flushes that are done the basic maintenance teeth cleaning things that aren't on time greatly shortens and reduce his life for that vehicle\nYeah no doubt Suzie before you got any industry in a come to work for the garage did you have a any of these sort of use court situations where you bought it you drove it and then three months later there was a huge issues\nNow I'm I'm going to go back to that car that I talked about earlier because it's funny that ah Chris mentioned you know at needs aides the recharge it exactly what it said in the ad to\nMay need the navy the recharge may need an ally Mitt may need um you know just a small thing and like I said when it came down to it it was control armed with a with everything that needed to be able to play really don't\nKnow I mean if you're looking at an ad whether it's I mean we're not beaten Craig's list up slowly but even the car on the corner like you just don't know I mean it's it's really risky and I got to tell you a lot of you have an uncle or or an aunt for that matter that it's a mechanic\nAnd that's cool but I think it's important to have that exchange I paid you for some accountability Chris what's your thought on that like somebody's paying you you're going to be accountable you're going to take risks\nFor oh I've done them I named my reputation I have to put on the line whenever I look at something so if I get some of the thumbs up I Want to I Want to make sure I'm giving them a thumbs up I Would give them a thumbs down than obviously\nThere's something to run away from and I've had customers come in when I tell them to not buy a vehicle because it's got to salvage restore title because their needs is worker that word yeah and there's still so fixated on the point that they really really liked the car that they want it you know do\nI mean well and and then to the wall it looked like we're talking comfortably you're listening chill relax but the minute like the deal is on\nLike it becomes different for us I mean we're all\n... thousands of dollars while I'm just like we\nWe it's like we we kind of panic about the deal and then you know we're we're kind of to a wallet like we believe like this is what I got that one of my pain is going to give it to me so\nI Want you to stay tuned we're also going to cover up some of the other items are that can be notorious a headlight they said you just need a headlight bold you want to stay tuned because this is not just the headlight fold can be really expensive state to French nation\nThat [noise] walk on mobile back rich nation shock is\nFrank here and of course ah Chris Belgium with the car shop I Want to remind you guys you know the gay with a K.
