people have seen the end right through this let's go to a Melissa Missouri line one Melissa\nHi I just wanted to say I'm I've been on both sides I've been in in a doctor fourth position and I've been in judge Kevin opposition where um I was attacks there was a molested\nOr in a doctor's office in fact and then um another time a former friend accused me or spread rumors about me that I was sleeping with her husband and I had no way to protect my reputation\nAnd so I Would have believed her if\nShe had come out with Kavanaugh's demeanor and said you crave you did this to me and if he had taken her to meet her and said oh I don't remember I don't remember what I did when I was in high school I Would have really the story but I didn't believe it\nI didn't believe her allegations from the get go just because of the timing of the letter and I want to start a mantra on your show right now Dianne Feinstein must resign\nNah I appreciate it eight five five forty Laura oh let's go to Paul main real quick Paul\nOr a um\nI I just wanted to say I think um\nEveryone tries to say so many people said a doctor for ... testimony was credible but that's because it's the polite thing to say it's a politically correct thing to say it's like saying Santa Claus exists I think\nAnybody that looks at her testimony objectively would say it wasn't credible and\nMr Trump President Trump is willing to hope that balloon of the social law and he's willing to say no Santa Claus doesnt exist we need to grow up\nAnd and I I just I I think that's you know I think that's what he's trying to do here\nI appreciate it eight five five forty Laura uh this is going to go down as one of the hardest fought confirmations and Supreme Court history if not the most difficult\nAh but in the end I think it's worth it you know why you can't reward people who make false charges you can't reward people who make allegations after the process has gone through with no contemporaneous ... who have\nSome type of axe to grind can't do it\nAnd same goes with these people showing up in the Senate and cornering people in elevators none of that should be allowed it's a game of intimidation they're playing it we know people who practice emotional extortion a political extortion this is a this is like an emotional terrorism\nSo conservatives need not apply because if you ever had a beer and high school and never partied too hard you can't you can't ever work\nAnd Supreme Court history if not the most difficult ah but in the end I think it's worth it you know why you can't reward people who make false charges you can't reward people who make allegations after the process has gone through with no contemporaneous preparation who have\nSome type of axe to grind can't do it\nAnd same goes with these

work\nAlso saying he never heard anything about a sexual assault in other tidbits ah so that's out there for what that's worth and also Christine Ford's friend in Delaware was a career FBI agent and likely together they were likely together during the accusation letter construction\nNow and that will get into sort of more about this but this is also very interesting uh joining us now centered David Perdue from the great state of Georgia senator how are you\nLog in morning I don't know what the word ... means but I think I'm work 'cause I'm pissed this morning I'll apologize to your listeners going there but this is a sham it's a new low in America this level of character assassination I didn't think we would see again in my lifetime but I'm disgusted with the process this week\nUh the the fact that President Trump comes out yesterday and starts talking about it\nAh and says look this could be your father your brother's son she's getting excoriated and the media or they're saying he he's attacking a victim how did you take it\n[noise] well I agree with the president hundred percent but you know the war on women law has been perpetrated by the Democrats in this case you\nKnow a doctor for one of the you know I don't know the woman but she wanted this to be kept confidential and the Democrats exposed it they leaked it and they exposed it intentionally for their own purpose\nBut this is part of a bigger attempt by the Democrat to take this to a new level I mean the paid activists that or well right now or my wife and I were physically accosted at a public airport on Monday This week because of this\nThese people were paid by the center of public democracy or they get money from the open society foundation which is George Soros who was putting to listen to this more than thirty two billion billion dollars into this effort over the last couple of years this is a bigger issue and it's not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week\nAnd I think ah you're exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense absolutely everyone on their heels\nBeen perpetrated by the Democrats in this case\nYou know a doctor for whether you know I don't know the woman but she wanted this to be kept confidential and the Democrats exposed it they leaked it and they exposed it intentionally for their own purposes\nBut this is part of a bigger attempt by the Democrats to take this to a new level I mean the paid activists that are well right now or my wife and I were physically accosted at a public airport on Monday This

thirty two billion billion dollars into this effort over the last couple years this is a bigger issue and it's not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week\nNow and I think you're exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense absolutely\nEveryone on their heels all the time like Jeff Flake later this hour in the elevator and then you get these things are yelling at me it turns out the woman is a ... executive director of of the Soros are funded group as you said Center for democracy and I think it's time to turn the tables were okay sunshine on you who are you people\nWho are working for this organization you are carrying on and I think you could make the argument senator that uh and maybe a good lawyer plaintiff lawyer could do this or just go to good litigation attorney could do this this is kind of a\nIt's a Rico deal like these groups are working together to deny other people their rights to movement free movement which is guaranteed under our constitution association\nOr they're ... they're acting in a way to deprive others I I Would say of there are inherent in civil rights and I totally agree meant to intimidate\nI totally agree but listen to what these senators are doing to incite the crazies in this effort this is senator Cory Booker you just had him on their here's another one\nThis is Corey Booker please get up in the face of some congresspeople representative Maxine Waters they're not going to be able to go to a restaurant go to a gas station go to shop at a department store\nTheir absolute get up and absolutely harass them\nNancy Pelosi I don't know why they aren't uprising all over the country\nI mean it goes on tell me again while we shouldn't confront Republicans were they eat where they sleep where they work until they stop being complicit\nThis is outrageous law\nAnd it it if it doesn't do anything else that you'd served a wake us up you're exactly right Democrats had been playing office for the last hundred years this time for Republicans to stop being a minority party in ... and and grow and grow up and you don't have to grow up and become a you know stop playing defense this is this is the time right now\nA senator for do ah there's so much a that is happening ... which is positive\nOr in this administration the news has been a ... ... only negative or because that's where the media are they're not going to I mean we just had this NAFTA deal pass okay a or B or negotiate has to pass the Senate\nEveryone said this can happen they said Trump was a big uh\n... uh Obama ridiculed I'm going to maybe the way this magical I'm going to renegotiate all these deals well you know didn't took actually work to do this like Nineteen months of work and and you must hear nothing

free trade agreement with South Korea were about how wall with Mexico and Canada Europe is talking about zero terrorists we have China paying stepping up and paying attention to us now we have a

denuclearization of North Korea this person's agendas working at all we talk about is what the Democrats want us to talk about that is what you're saying is that we need to be on the op is talking about what's working in this agenda before we get into these elections in a few weeks\nI I can tell you the senator no one's going to want to try to stop me moving in a public street or try to harassment or restaurant okay this is a new I tolerate that anyone comes in my family and my kids\nThey they they better be they'd been it'd be really ready because this is I I'm not intimidated by

for your three square meals a day and you're you're\nYou know your your activism on the side I mean I just it just doesn't impress me I call these people right after their faces\nLaw that's what we're going to be ... this week and it starts right here in the United states at people who are supporting this actively encouraging and citing it we have a state representative that actually was involved in our altercation on Monday a state representative from\nFrom Arizona okay of all places here and watch these are not genuine people who are ... are out\nOf Dr Ford or anything else they are paid activists this is a George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them in stand up and fight for our country because that's what's at stake here\nDo you think we have enough Republican money

to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says\nIf judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court and who I think now bears the bears the burden of this proving these allegations the presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process is not convenient for the Democrat\nI mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again cause him evil\nOr the other one said a

that's where the country's coming through and it's a sad day when when that's the way people think of public discourse should be held\nWell again we're teaching these young people that this this is the normal course of business is just the way you interact to shout you know and for you to someone in their face use use screen at them and say look at me look at me if they did to Jeff Flake or and you prevent their movement\nOr they were blocking the ice officers in Portland not so long ago for weeks and weeks people couldn't even come and go to their workplace without being harassed salute\nJust it just shouldn't be just shouldn't be allowed and get it that's not how civil discourse occurs in this country or you can you can agree or disagree with with with what ice does but the fact is there a legitimate law enforcement agency if you don't like it you know\nTry to you know the temperature change the law obviously that's what some of these individuals doing by tempting to elect people who said either going to abolish ice I disagree with that but again we can have a public discussion but you don't have to get physical you don't have to threaten someone and again it it it uh it's sad when you know when when a member of Congress goes out and says\nUh this is the way you should protest is you know getting people's faces confront them uh it's not civil it's not right it's not the way I was raised and I guess some people are just raised differently in terms of what they think is acceptable\nWithout being harassed salute\nA you know just it just shouldn't be just

and I guess some people are just raised differently in terms of what they think is acceptable and ended up in a free country\nA congressman Harris your thoughts on the overall political climate in America I Know you sit in the house of representatives but given\nWhere this Kavanaugh's confirmation saga has gone with unsubstantiated allegations most all of them are falling apart now of those people are finally coming out and saying oh I Know this person she she\nHelps to help someone take a polygraph wants clearly lied under oath if that's the case he's a firsthand witness of this or old a whole Bo\nUm and it seems to me that we have a lot of people with a lot of money who are unhappy that Donald Trump became\nPresident and by any means necessary they will attempt to derail his agenda but not with substance with again these types of stunts\nOh oh absolutely uh Laura ... in the media is the right front and center on this\nI'll tell you uh you know I was kind of a physician and I watched the testimony and my comment was it was pretty clear that Dr Ford is a troubled person and I think anybody who watch the testimony a comes up to that conclusion and she admitted that she has had psychological issues\nI said that in a in a in a interview and I was accused of saying I said that she couldn't be trusted now I didn't say that but that's the that's what the media water to portray they have an agenda\nAnd and that's that's what's so different now than from Thirty years ago the agenda is so obvious is so a parrot or for many many members of the media this president thank goodness is speaking out against it ah you know calling calling it on its face and uh that had that had to be done and of course he gets criticized when he goes out to\nA congressman Harris thank you

actually coached on lie detector testing were together for the four days leading up to the actual writing of the letter from the twenty sixth of the thirtieth\nIt would appear this is a conservative a tree house it would appear that forward was with McLean again the retired FBI agent and former former New York field office spokesperson at the time she wrote the letter the Feinstein\nThat would certainly begin to explain quite a bit about who exactly was handling moves forward and how there would be an intentional effort from a subject matter expert on how to best position the attack against Kavanaugh\nWho better to scrub the Internet history and know what process he is and people to enlist in such preparatory work than a retired lawyer who were deeply inside the FBI a lot of people are saying deep state was involved in all this not only did ms McLean possess a particular set of skills to assist system is forward\nBut ms McLean would also have a network of de OJ an FBI resources to assist in this endeavor\nA former friendly FBI agent to do the polygraph a network of politically motivated allies\nDoes the appearance of FBI insider and deputy FBI Director uh to Andrew Andrew McCabe Michael Brown which begin now to make more sense\nThink about it remember the lawyer she ultimately got withdrawn which\nBrown which was as Andy McCabe lawyer Andy McCabe former deputy director of the FBI\nAnd we know that ah\nFlight called McCabe before but\nNot ... the um Rosenstein scares me before they he decided to ask for that extra week and that that doesn't really bother me because they want to know what you can get done in a week an FBI background\nBut this FBI connection with the woman she was now reportedly within ... beach it's fascinating\nSo again if you want to examine whether she misled the committee put this country through a nightmare you need all her text messages all her emails\nAll of those that have been deleted which are recoverable and that is for Powell McLean anyone who was ... was talking to her at the time including anyone from Feinstein's office all of that needs to be out all of it\nDo you agree with me that you cannot allow people to get away from this get away with us excuse me\nThe same thing with Julie sweating it if you could submitting statements to the Senate Judiciary committee that are false knowingly false you should be prosecuted for that I don't care how long it takes I Would prosecute for that\n... and I I bet that text messaging trail to Christine Ford tells a fascinating story about what really went down\nAnd I'd subpoena that therapists if the therapist even exists subpoena that therapist they look there is no patient a doctor privilege here apparently she was releasing notes and showing them to at least showing to the Washington Post she references I met her testimony gone no privilege\nMe that you cannot allow people to get away from the get away with us excuse me\nThe same thing with Julie sweat neck if

lot to uncover here so they want to go through other Brett Kavanaugh to use the word drunk in a handwritten note to friends or whether he threw ice Nineteen eighty five I\nI'm not in July what happened that do you what would you be curious to know that I Would I Want to know if a former FBI agent\nOr who has an enormous amount of institutional knowledge about how to scrub Internet history

this is wakeup time\nThe truth is always comes back to find you know it does no matter what the situation it always comes back\nYou endorsed by Elizabeth Warren et cetera are against the tax cuts for socialized thirty two trillion dollars more and socialize healthcare you'd have to double the tax rates at the corporate level and individual level to pay for it\nAnd that would bring the economy to a standstill so these these folks that are running on the left shouldn't get a bike first base and they're getting a look just did they have so much money coming in from ... blue and so that's our challenge right now it's just getting the facts out like you said or as you open\nWhat is a act blue\nOr that just a big nationwide you know Democrats fundraising peace they have Republicans don't have that they do Republicans\nDo more of the party Democrats bundle they you know they're billionaires lined up across the country and then they bundle at all to their preferred candidate by state and so my opponent for example just like seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nIn August alone in one month which is just unheard of races in the past number cost that much into Democrats are raising that hand over fist they don't have a policy we would win eighty twenty but they they just are going off you know she's running commercials that I'm against pre existing conditions and has a very emotional piece\nGetting a ... just ... they have so much money coming in from ... blue and so that's our challenge right now it's just getting the facts out like you said or as you open\nWhat is

know she's running commercials that I'm against pre existing conditions and has a very emotional piece a with a young boy and medical coverage et cetera except the whole piece is just\nUtterly falls and they're doing that to all candidates across the country they're referring to a procedural vote before we voted for Republican or health care piece that did have pre existing conditions\nAnd so they're just it's it's a lie of the first order and they're doing it across the board and so we we've got to get the word out to voters and so folks out there you know look up Dave Brat dot com and help me out if you can't\nYeah Dave rent dot com everyone go there ah contribute to this campaign because Republicans are being outspent because we have mega billionaires led by siren George Soros is the Washington Free beacon pointed out a few days ago\nRolling out huge amounts of money for state focus donations for a campaign's excuse me\nThey know it it just it comes down to turn out in mid term race to come out to turn out in energy and Donald Trump demonstrated I think very well that\nIt's not just you know it's not just uh how much money you spend on advertising however\nUh it it ... it matters that you get airtime it matters that you are fighting for the people against these types of focused tactics\nAre on the left or this these vicious intimidation campaigns the demonization of boys and men and brothers and fathers and husbands and I would stick to all those issues congressman because I think that's I think this is Brett Kavanaugh issue\nEven though you're in the house and it's all determined in the Senate I think it cuts across party lines and I think it\nIs an awakening for Republicans this midterm election cycle your thoughts\nYeah no you're you're right on the money you I I Want without funding it a path\nBut this one the millions and billions being spent and then the tactics that you mentioned my town hall there they seven hundred activists came from the laughs wearing a pastor as he gave the opening prayer at my last town hall it's all on video people go Google it and that people just ... door walkers for Sanford or\nA campaign just left a piece on my house my daughter's home alone for people show up at the door looking at my windows taking pictures walking around my house to leave a piece of says ... health day\nThat my daughter has to retrieve you know half hour later she stayed in the house that go out that God or and then the young man that was busted we have video of all of it ends up talking to spanberger within a half hour\nAnd so I you know what do you conclude from that uh it it's not good out their their their you know patient people at a restaurant or no due process or in it\nIt's the left is fighting with tactics we've just never seen before especially on the fundraising and so get out there no matter where you are in this country and support the support good conservatives are that are out there running because they need help right now there's a lot of folks are that are deep down in numbers I'm running a tight one\nSandberg or a campaign just left a piece on my house my daughter is home alone for people show up at the

deep down in numbers I'm running a tight one and so all they need help too but uh it just ... you're right well are we just need to stay on message is\nOne of the biggest thing Iran I was immigration and the left there's nothing that separates the mainstream voting rights or Seventy eighty percent issue the left right and I was for open borders\nA sanctuary city is no rule of law that they're they're running as moderates but they're left of JFK by a mile and so that's the big new change\nYeah it's a radical you know we have ... real results in this Republican a majority the results versus radicalism\nIt's yeah it's acts are ceilings it's information over intimidation results over ... over and over and over again\nYeah GDP is four point to right now it's going to be over four and a half right it on ... ... it's what Kennedy achieve what you did your Kennedy did something ...\nBut I Will tell you Dave Dave I'll tell you this and I tell us talking my Republican friends running numbers don't make it numbers there's a reason your opponent is doing a commercial with a a within medically challenged child\nIt's about emotional ... so you have the emotional argument is your father is your son's your brothers and real victims of sexual assault has been a had been you have ... are in jeopardy because of what's happening in Washington\nAnd and yeah well that that's right that's what you need I mean I ... the numbers are you know that's it's great\nBut you get people yellow hung up on emotions\nGoing with that my my opponent said don't don't look at the numbers are skinny number and my response to that air go look at a hundred billion Walmart shoppers\nWho sales are through the roof and that the kitchen table issue right everybody's life is way better off now everybody two dollars a box back in the pocket and it\nIt's a family issue it is a kitchen table issue and so they are they're they're running against the good news ah I'm I like where we are but uh we we just got to have all our our entire team start focusing messaging together and like you said we've got to type stories that's where I ended up people\nIs Ryan and raising money for you if you drink the money just for the a congressional campaign a committee but it'd be ... ... ... raising money in part is getting money from them\nYeah Yup yup Paul Ryan's or helped out a ... a bunch of other outside groups are coming in to help out a thank goodness and so what they're doing that around the country\nAnd ah we were we can win and the economy is so fundamental right and it's just it's not just the numbers the optimism every small business that go meet with or buying a new truck or buying a new little piece of capital equipment or hiring one more person but that's a huge deal most of where I live it's just mainly small businesses\nThey're all at a good mood so it's like you said the\nIt's got to have all our our entire team start focusing messaging together and like you said we've got to type

piece of capital equipment they're hiring one more person but that's a huge deal most up where I live which has made like small businesses\nAnd they're all at a good mood so it's like you said\nThat the key is they have to get out and vote they cannot stay home we need\nEverybody out everybody go tell your church your church your business is your sports clubs just all the good decent people need to get out and vote\nFor we're not backward you want to go forward we need to go forward it's was optimistic pro American pro American worker pro manufacturing base\nAnd thank God we have people in Congress like Dave Brat and a President Trump President Trump by the way is in the rose garden yesterday uh oh was it yesterday on Monday tires Monday during the NAFTA announcement said this\nI really believe that the people of our country they want the wall and they want border security they don't want to open borders like the Democrats want to have\nAnd I really think I have a very big decision to make some time right after the election very quickly do I want to do it before the election personally yes but I don't want to do that for different reasons because I have some very find people that are running in close races in the may affect them and it may not it may be good for them I happen to think it would be good for them\nI think Trump is usually rightness political calculation is he is he right to put this off though and Republicans until after the election\nIt either way it's his call I mean usually with the problem in the budget process it we've lost our leverage right we we let it be known that nine Senate Democrats will block us\nUntil right now we don't at the beginning of the cycle or it after the election our laboratory back to a hundred percent so he's probably right on that call and we got to have a fight on that one right that was one of the biggest rallying cries up his election\nAnd of mine and the people want to see it and a nine Senate Democrats walk it uh we got to let the world see that and and the whole parties gotta come behind the president on this immigration issue because it is the issue that just\nDivides the crony elites up until you say you're from the average person back in my district that everybody I talk to\nYou you want a wall you want to seal the border and you want to get rid of the gang activity and ... it's not just immigration is tied to the opioid problem Fenton all three hundred billion lethal doses of ... know came across the border this year in one year\nThat's linked to human trafficking that link the gang activity breakdown of the family mental health depression of the kids is up Seventy percent that's all tied and we've been working like crazy with our with our share of\nLike the immigration is intimately linked to all these other fundamental social problems we have if you don't get it right or we're not going to solve these problems\nUh Dave Brat here on the lower income show go to Dave
