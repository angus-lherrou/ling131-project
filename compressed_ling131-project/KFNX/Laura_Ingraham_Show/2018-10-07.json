I remember it was an August and I'm thinking of a two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on and talking about how people were losing trucked in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was the only two groups in and this was before for August and by the way some remember that part of it so whatever that you know few months before\nFor your family your church synagogue jump or whatever it may be\nBut you can do that without having to get caught up in all of the the viciousness that has become the system but I Do want to talk a little bit of politics today simply because\nIt it how it's going to I think potentially affect the market and could potentially affect the market in a very great way I'm going to take a step back\nTo ... I remember it was an August and I'm thinking of a two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on and talking about how people were losing trust in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was the only two groups\nIn and this was before ... and by the way some remember that part of it or whatever that you know few months before that so they rate\nWhat they're only two institutions that more than half the people in this country had faith in one of which was the military at Seventy seven percent and the other was cops at about fifty two percent\nAnd one of the points I made was and again this was pretty Ferguson is you know there was a lot of pressure already be put on kind of people's views of cops and that may not be holding given that it was only fifty two percent back then and that would have very important implications\nI have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong\nBut if that were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings\nAnd it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives are going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just because I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the classroom and to be teaching is before the crash\nAnd the idea of this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is\nBefore the market goes down you got to know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up\nBut the average retail trade or will never make money in the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I've given us want a thought too about you know people keep coming in and told me\nThing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not in my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just 'cause I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the class I'm going to be teaching is before the crash\nAnd the idea of this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is\nBefore the market goes down you got to know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up\nBut the average retail trade or will never make money and the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I've given us a lot of thought to about you know people keep coming in and telling me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors will define investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realize that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble they put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong\nAnd again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is is that when the market turns down can turn down very quickly\nIf you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of games think about this from it Thirteen\nYears of games in a year and a half okay if you want Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now\nHow is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down and you can on the move up so getting class we're gonna talk about all these ideas we're also going to really get into how the market works\nPeople you know some people focus on what's called technical analysis they're using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked winter like four okay\nYou know you have your ... to ... in your are your uh see the eyes and you know there's an old for thousands or hundreds of these things right so how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got they won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kinda figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecast is really not much better than random chance right\nSo they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look you can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now\nAnd the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes [laughter] [laughter] and that's a lot of this is that people use something because it's the best they think they've got but it's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things are really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market is supply and demand\nOf you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecast is really not much better than random chance right\nSo they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look you can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now\nAnd the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes [laughter] and that's a lot of this is that people use something because it's the best they think they've got but it's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things really understand about the market to\nWhat trying to market of supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make this a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but we always make sure that when we wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really isn't the disciplined approach to what I Would call investing\nAs opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do so again if you want to come out to a class I'm going to be teaching this one

dedicated to helping small businesses thrive\nThere are three ways to benefit from score each year\nWe hold over one hundred expert workshops at convenience sites around the valley on topics ranging from marketing to finance the operations next you can browse are online resource library\nBut where to find it and at what cost Hi I'm Alan ... speaking for greater Phoenix for the nonprofit volunteer driven organization dedicated to helping small businesses thrive there are three ways to benefit from score each year\nWe hold over one hundred expert workshops at convenience sites around the valley on topics ranging from marketing to finance the operations next you can browse are online resource library\nI don't have a dog in the fight I don't you know I can make money up or down it makes no difference to me but I think that if you have Democrats control of Congress after the fall and you may think this is the greatest thing in the world and that's not my argument my argument is I think there's going to have a tremendous impact on the markets and it's going to be exceptionally negative\nBecause what you've just lived through a judge Kavanaugh you're going to live through with Donald Trump for the next two years because it will be two years of hearings and it will be brutal and it will be bloody and it will it is not going to inspire confidence markets drop thrive on confidence it\nAlso means that his ability to continue to cut taxes and regulation again you may think those are bad things but those things have helped the market\nWe have to realize that all of that is at risk of changing pretty quickly so that the classroom it'd be teaching and and by the way it totally aside from that there's some other things out there right now that indicate that the market may well be near the top\nAnd I'm really getting into to those ideas and just a couple of minutes but\nTo me the key is you have to know what to do before things go bad if you wait till they go bad is it happens way too fast and you can't react in time\nYou've got to be position before it happens now when the markets falls I mentioned the market when it fell in two thousand eight two thousand nine the market and the U.S and the gay backs Thirteen Years of profits in a year and a half\nThat's how fast these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to two thousand level and that was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years\nAnd people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon most people's investment horizon it's thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years\nAnd you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside that's very very hard for people to achieve their goals\nSo we're going to be talking about how do we identify the prices would you begin institutions like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at\nYou know when he was buying an apple a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five that would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and I will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was fined apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just under ...\nAnd that was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years and people think well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon most people's investing horizon it's thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years\nAnd you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside that's very very hard for people to achieve their goals\nSo going to be talking about how do we identify the prices would you begin institutions like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at\nYou know when he was buying apple it a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five that would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and that will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was fine apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics of how I don't want to actually make money when the stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is that they invest in stocks because they think they're safe stocks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into because their markets only open six and a half hours a day Seventeen and a half hours of every day and forty eight hours of every weekend you cannot protect yourself\nYes you can use options to limit your losses but you're still going to have launches okay if you had homeowner's insurance and it only covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected I think most people would not okay\nAnd my dad's the situation people in in the market so again to me this is an incredibly important class and I will I've ... I've taught this class before it's always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those will be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThey the world is changed in my opinion from a market every no manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you can always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at at charged with looking it indicators which are the wrong thing\nDid they fundamentally better approach again that I was teaching a class so if you want to come out you can get to free tickets free tablet plus we'll feed you launch be one of the next dozen callers\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that T.

these really high electric bills and ... and the therapy because atheists and that's where people had some dues or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake cutting let's let's take a look at the bill so when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes and surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nThis is a house that she's going to be in for another twenty or twenty five years and this ... never going down it's never going to go away and it's never going down and the only thing it's going to do you keep on increasing [noise]\nNow secret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management and let me talk about that we see on our built this thing called demand and a lot of people an ape you this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe there ain't point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just day regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power from last year differently\nAnd now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hardest time of the day between three and have him and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly or doing to us the\nThis new charge on their bill called the man and it's a number of like maybe ... came point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three ten\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power from last year differently\nAnd now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hardest time of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\nThere's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it\nSo the smart energy management the way to the analogy of the people like like that I've been told\nIs remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance Monday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist no matter when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when it's hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added on to our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're killing off our hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty four cents that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your ...\nSince that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS and asked her if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you any more so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's going to continue to go up\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them\nAnd I explain all this to them so not only are you paying between seven and half and eat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying two words the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your homes Carol and that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um\n... it just it doesn't make sense for them they can you bring me a raise everybody should just call you just find out how to read\nTheir bill and then I don't know how to read their ... and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if you go why didn't I Do the sooner I write so many people who will say that on my show all the time it's site and I do a rate\nI'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us\nThat have been hearing a four year year and a half and today there is out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time and then they go home now I understand what she rains and so no judgments but at the end of the day we\nHave an electric bill we will always have an electric bill\nMy God I Can't even believe that if you go why didn't I Do the sooner I write so many people who will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site and I do a rate I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this

time\nAnd then they go home now I understand what she rains and so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car\nAnd gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and pay two fifty and that's essentially Carol I'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS Messer petri punch today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home will use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid the power company\nCut that in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money well here's what we're\nGoing to do we want to give out your phone number because everyone really should just give recall she does a free consultation she's raised with the better

go to ... make sure it's ... dot com\nFill out the kilowatt worksheet and she can help you save money on a bill that you're already paying way too much money on what are your final words for today you know\nIt it's the simplest is you know I really am on the mission and when I helped my daughter it was the first time in a long time due to my circumstances that I was able to do\nSomething really significant in her life because I financially wasn't able to help her but I saw the really big problem for her and it gave me\nA self accomplishment in it she was so ever so grateful than she shared it with her neighbors and a lot of her neighbors did it because the than I was able to help them understand that my daughter was able to help them understand it\nSo now it's about I'm there to

it's asked sell solar Sandy dot com\n[noise] [noise] [noise] Hi solar here currently you're buying power from your company's paying\nLet's think about that some more by examining some passages that recap redemption sum it up in a single word\nDoes the Bible teaches that we're say by faith and does it do so in a way that faith sums up salvation certainly that's the case Romans by one says that we are justified by state\nThat passage rage therefore having been justified by fate we have peace with got our Lord Jesus Christ\nThat appears to be a most suitable text to support our contention that redemption can be summed up any single word here of course the single word faith stand in the place of the entire redemptive process\nBut does the use of the word faith in this passage exclude repentance does it excludes baptism does it excludes all other written emptive elements will return to that and just a moment does the Bible really teach that we are said by repentance\nDoes the Bible do so in a summary way certainly read for example acts chapter eleven nurse Eighteen it says when they heard these things they became silent and glorified God saying than God has also granted to the gym to oust ripped tempted to life\nPeter by divine instruction preached the gospel to Cornelius a century an antigen top\nJewish Christians those who are the circumcision acts eleven three took Peter to task for going into um circumcised mayhem in eating with them\nSo Peter in his defense and more importantly in defense of what God commanded him to do Peter ... counted the details of his trip to the house\nThat and just a moment does the Bible really teach that we are said Byron pinch\nThere's a Bible do so in a summary white certainly read for example acts chapter eleven nurse Eighteen it says\nWhen they heard these things and they became silent and glorified God saying then God has also granted to the gym dolls repentance to life Peter by divine instruction preached the gospel to Cornelius a century in at a gym top\nJewish Christians those who were the circumcision acts eleventh three took Peter to task for going into an circumcised mayhem in eating with them\nSo Peter in his defense and more importantly in defense of what God commanded him to do Peter ... counted the details of his trip to the household of corn ...\nAt the end of that defense we read the ... that we just mentioned\nActs chapter eleven nurse Eighteen when Peters accusers heard what Peter said in his explanation they stop their criticism they glorified God and they said that God quote granted to the gym toss repentance to live\nClearly the single word repentance was used here as a term that stood in the place up everything redemptive in that regard each used was like our prior some re statement about fate\nBut there's a word repentance an excellent an Eighteen does it ruled out faith does rule out that does it does it just mass every other salvation principal and salvation practice as we noted concerning our faith example they'll get back to that in just a moment\nLet's deal with one more example that a baptism\nDoes the Bible teach that we are saved my baptism\nDoes the Bible ever used the single word baptism as it stands for the whole of the redemptive process again the answer is yes definitively here what Peter ... Peter three rivers Twenty one\nThere is also an end to type which now saves us baptism knocked the removal of the ... the flash but the answer I have a good conscience toward God do the resurrection of Jesus Christ\nHere Peter compared the physical salvation of Noah and his family the water first beat her three twenty with salvation by water in baptism\nBaptism in this context appears as a nation of the salvation experience the saving process but as they used the word baptism and first beat her three Twenty one does it excludes faith does baptism in this setting eliminate repentance\nEats each of these three terms faith and repentance and baptism if each of them serves as an ... a summary of salvation which I'm at three most accurately represents God's word\nDoes that question come across as fair more sensible\nAre we trying to rank one single word some return over another I Hope not\nBecause as we have already seen these terms are only abridged forms of salvation\nThey state what redemption includes in a short and form but nothing in any of these context that we just sided nothing demands that they do so to the exclusion of the fuller longer discussions redemption discussions that refer to multiple elements in the same context\nDid you see that we asked if the summary expression justified by fate excluded repentance and baptism the correct answer no it does not\nWe also asked if the summary\nAccurately represents God's word\nDoes that question come across as fair more sensible are we trying to rank one single word summary term over another I Hope not\nBecause as we have already seen these terms are only abridged forms of salvation\nThey state what redemption includes in the short inform but nothing in any of these contacts that we just sided nothing demands that they do so to the exclusion of the fuller longer discussions redemption discussions that refer to multiple elements in the same context\nDid you see that we asked if the summary expression justified by faith excluded repentance and baptism the correct answer no it does not\nWe also asked if the summary expression repentance on the life ruled out faith and baptism the proper answer to that question another no\nWe're not surprised then to see the answer to the third question does baptism as an abstract or a ... an expression of redemption in first Peter three Twenty one does baptism count how does your rule out faith and repentance for the final time the response must be no\nWell how do we know that first we knew it by realizing that there exist no biblical support for salvation by state to the exclusion of anything and everything else\nNor does any evidence exists for salvation by repentance without anything or everything else in the same thing can be said about that does have nothing but the Bible teaches\nAbout baptism inherently rules out fate or repentance\nSecond we know that no single element stands alone because to contend with this idea amounts to arguing for three different three distinct methods of redemption one might say another by red tensions and the third by baptism do we really believe that scripture teaches us that\nAnd third we knew that no

because everybody has to fill everybody has the power bill that we all\nWe are all very frustrated especially this summer I've seen so many people that have called me listening to our show Carol I'm and I'm On different radio shows as well and my whole mission is because of my daughter\nFive years ago [noise] um that I wasn't able to help my own daughter pay her power bill due to an accident and then I had many years ago I myself was on a fixed income Social Security disability and when she reached out to me and said mom I really need help with my ...\nI said well honey I really can't help you that much with your ... but by the way how much does it\nAnd when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident and I said ... you have the little tiny\nWhy you're here so much why am I here so much because everybody has a lot ... everybody has the power bill that we all\nWe are all very frustrated especially this summer I'm seeing so many people that have called me listening to our show Carol\nI'm and I'm On different radio shows as well and my whole mission is because of my daughter five years ago\n[noise] um that I wasn't able to help my own daughter pay her power bill due to an accident and then I had many years ago I myself was on a fixed income Social Security disability and when she reached out to me and said mom I really need help with my ...\nI said well honey I really can't help you that much with your ... but by the way how much does it\nAnd when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident and I said ... you have a little tiny house how is your purview however bilby so high\nI said there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and ... and ... because a the estimates are people had some users this summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake ... let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nUm I use you know gee there's lots of people out there that can make hamburger okay but all these things but there's only one that has a secret sauce now\nThe secret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management and let me talk about that we see on our built this thing called demand and a lot of people an ape you this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe Thirteen point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power of the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hardest time of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave it\nFive four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hardest time of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies in a monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest some of the day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\nThere's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it so the smart energy management the way to the analogy of the people like like that I've been told is\nRemember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance Monday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay ... a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist no matter when we called him a long distance phone calls\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when it's hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're killing off our hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now\nAnd I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I say the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it it's a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS semester if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you anymore so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's gonna continue to go up\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them\nAnd I explain all this to them so not only are you paying between seven and half and eat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying two words the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're listening more comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus the electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um\nIt it just it doesn't make sense for them they can you tell me a raise everybody should just call you just find out how to read\nTheir bill and they know how to read they're real and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if you go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site and I do a rate I'm review and break it down\nIt's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again\nAnd I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half\nAnd today they're out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time and then they go home now I understand what she writes and so no judgments but at the end of the\nWe all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is ...\nIt's I ... I Do a rate I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half and today they're out

gallon and gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and pay you fifty and that's essentially Carol I'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS Messer piece rate puns today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home we use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid the power company cut that in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money well here's what we're going to do we\nWant to give out your phone number because
