guess he's been talking to\nYeah I mean we have to get into this show the odd situation I I again he walks into a a a its consulate in Turkey\nAnd he doesn't come out okay so looks like something happen got chopped up or something I we we don't know what happened but of course he um he ... he wrote a column in Saudi on Arab newspaper that was canceled\nYou know the guys you know marriage was collapsing at one point and you know he now he's he's an Islamic even though in New York Times today said look the guys in Islam asked\nBut also has been a path royal service now doesn't mean you should be obviously shouldn't be killed but there are people out there seem to want us to go to war over a person you know like the person being killed or snuffed out in someone else's conflict I mean how is how does that make any sense that\nWell really this is a this was a classic case of the question of morality versus state interest a ... is I mean from everything we know controlled you went in there they brought in a forensic experts from Saudi Arabia where the bone saw\nAnd he didn't come out in your head Fifteen guys going onto planes and come out the same day and the Turks have a lot of tapes and videos claim and we've got some information that the prince of Saudi Arabia was trying to lure him back\nTo Saudi Arabia for some but not for some purpose show but the key thing here today is you've got the prince of Saudi Arabia's crown prince and the king put the credibility of Saudi Arabia on the line that they did not do this and so you've got to America's trucking it out\nAt the same time as this looks like a real ... in a moral atrocity\nAt the same time they were very serious state interests and us relations with Saudi Arabia so you've got to balance those things out you know I remember you know Richard Nixon and we're over there and try to toast and Mao tse dong at the same time they're going through the massacres of the great pro tour and cultural revolution\nBecause we needed to deal with the trying to use against the Russians and the Cold War it's a real conflict here between morality in state interest\nAnd it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out\nBut it's undeniable that Donald Trump believes he is acting in the best interest cold national interests of the United states\nMarco Rubio a someone who you know it's much more of a neo conservative a bill or find Russia\nAh on occasion with other Republican vilify met just ... you know I think acts like Russia's in sometimes be a bigger threat than it is even though he's been

for a magnet the investigation which means individuals responsible for that decision would be sanctioned beyond that there are other options that we can take I said that's something that needs to be thought through carefully but it needs to be very strong and meaningful campaign symbolic it can't just be words\nYou realize that\nI Do agree with mark ... excuse me Senator Rubio to this extent\nOr you can't just brush this well if if the investigation points to the crown prince and the crown prince\nI don't know how you make the future leader of Saudi Arabia persona non grata and impose sanctions on him personally say he can't come to the United states and seizes bank accounts or something like that she got a real conundrum here so I think what's going to happen\nIs the er the Saudis are not working with the Turks and the Turks a lot of countries over there in the middle east to have a real vested interest and not having a breach between Saudi Arabia and the United states so dental or you're going to see these\nInterests of ours against the sort of a moral decision you gotta take which is this is an outrage it can't be allowed to happen and it's got to be punished by sanctions at least against the individual someone suggested that the solution is going to be the inevitable road agents went and did something they weren't supposed to do\n'em and they wanted to give the crown prince ability right\nNow I mean this is ... and ... ...\nExactly and over again you know when I was running against are considering running against George W. Bush remembers the Tiananmen Massacre\nAnd tenement square was just a couple of months later that Scowcroft Eagleburger were over there toaster now\nSo you know you had the state interest in the relations with China at the same time you could not condone\nWhat they done to a democratic uprising and Antietam and square we've gone down through history one after another after another is and

[noise]\nOur Congress is letting our people down\n... we know the Democrats are just kind of welcome in more of it but why should Republicans be standing by allowing this to happen you have the\nHouse in the Senate now [noise] do something about it so you lose the house you get nothing you gotta have nothing but it's going to have a a wholesale invasion of the United states going to keep going\nMore and more and more and then you have all these we the reports on MSNBC they don't do the Wi Fi reports on the victims of violent crime by illegal immigrants they don't do those stories but they do the weeping story south of the border of all these people are sitting on the concrete with their kids playing with you know a paper doll\nAnd you the people are supposed to have your heartstrings completely uh polled\nBy the emotional manipulation of the American media they're emotionally manipulating I Can't stand that time to kind of reporting it's the easiest kind of reporting to do and it's the most dishonest\nLet's go to Paul in Virginia very quickly Paul\n... build a wall is going to go down\nAs Trump's your to your doctor\nIs done nothing on his border here he has failed miserably I don't care about Korea or trade deals or anything he lets this continue on this country is not we're never going to get anybody elected you're going to have the Elizabeth Warren\nAnd the bookers and everybody'd be elected in this country to his killing his country by not stopping I have to put the military on the other side of the border and stop that\nWell I think a lot of people agree with you and you see these you see this massive invasion imagine if the people\nWho claimed to be reporters were actually reporting on this like really reporting on it not just talking to the the the Seventeen year old who has two or three kids whose a poor person I get that they're desperate people I Do understand\nWe ... we feel for the people who are being manipulated and hurt into making this track\nBut we are Americans first we must must protect our border otherwise\nThis continue on this country is not we're never going to get anybody elected you're going to have

... what about this George or race or were you know everyone's looking at the house and the Senate but governorships are key\nAnd redistricting and a key and and I think motivating a party's base ah what do you expect to happen in the state of Georgia which is considered kind of a purple state these days\nYeah it's a key race Stacey Abrams has received a lot of outside money a lot of outside attention she's become a darling of the left and you just heard right there she is truly a progressive candidate saying we welcome undocumented\nVoters people who aren't legally allowed to vote in this country to come out and my race I mean that's just not something that we should be\nUm accepting as citizens and she's also saying I'm going to raise your taxes abolish sites all the things that the left is putting forward and it's a frightening prospect for the people of Georgia Brian Kemp would be much better choice and\nHe does have a slim lead and I'm hoping he will pull it out\nWell I think again this is about the future of America a we have Elizabeth Warren of course the great progressive savior and the Democrat Party are coming out today with this DNA test a where she claims that she does have [laughter]\nAncestry a of a Native American sort a initially\nReports were that she could be one thirty seconds Native American but now there's a\nThere's a there's now a Boston Globe\nQuestion about whether it's really like one one thousand ths given the math of how far removed her Native American ancestry could be yeah here it goes the report includes uh\nHe does have a slim lead and I'm hoping he will pull it out\nWell I think again this is about the future of America a we have Elizabeth Warren of course the great progressive savior and the Democratic party are coming out today with this DNA test a where she claims that she does have [laughter]\nAncestry a of a Native American sort a initially\nReports were that she could be one thirty seconds Native American but now there's a\nThere's a there's now a Boston Globe\nQuestion about whether it's really like one one thousand given the mass of how far removed her\nNative American ancestry could be yeah here it goes the report includes the possibility that she's just one one thousand twenty fourth Native American they just put that correction on the Boston Globe store\nYeah I mean I I'll tell you one thing she is a hundred percent not qualified to be our president where she would take our country it's frightening\nAnd it's interesting to see that she's running for Senate in Massachusetts this signals to the people of Massachusetts as clearly as possible she's running for president so\nShe's saying here give me another term as senator but I'm going to go run for president and walk away from the Senate seat as quickly as possible so um I Would love for their president to go up against Elizabeth I can't think of a better contrast bring it on\nThe boroughs like ... by this token if you\nIf you say you you know your part Austrian and and goes back and generations you get to claim nobility status and the Austrian author of Hungarian empire I mean this is this really what we're going to do now to get special privileges and colleges and universities I think this is what drives people crazy\nAnd it's offensive to Native Americans I mean it just is so and she doesn't apologize to them for you know capitalizing on their true heritage for her her benefit and and that's really the bottom line of that says that he's pushed that forward for benefit for her career\nFor her education and what she's one one thousand\nTo ... [laughter] I'm Sorry but this is funny but Donald Trump was asked about this or on a on the south lawn of the White House before he took off for Florida let's listen to\nYour\n\nA ... no no no he went on to say he hope she's running for president he hope she's running for president he went on and on about that that was the least interesting part of the uh the White House lawn but nevertheless he was he was like well I Hope she does run because this will be an easy way out for me\nYeah I Hope she ends up being the nominee I mean what Democrats are putting forward now the progressive left Democrats will change our country and and we did have video actually recently talking about what socialism actually means and the cost of it because\nDemocrats keeps saying free health care free that's free everything and they're not saying this well quadruple your taxes it will destroy our country go look at Venezuela get educated on this if you like the country that we live in today with a with economic opportunity with prosperity with wages coming up\nAt Democrats are not that people you want to vote for\n'em and I have to ask you about what\nThe house looks\nLike I Know it's hard to predict every races is different but\nDid anyone predict at this point that the Republicans would be frankly making a comeback it looks like in this mid term\nPets are putting forward now the progressive left Democrats\nWill change our country and and we did a video actually recently talking about what socialism actually means and the cost of it\nBecause Democrats keeps saying free health

hard to predict every races is different but\nDid anyone predict at this point that the Republicans would be frankly making a comeback it looks like\nIn this midterm election cycle was the Kavanaugh a win for Donald Trump and he turns around and I think he fights for for Kavanaugh unlike anyone else and now the people are like this can't use the best clothes or we have this could actually help in the house races\nIt could it is helping we're seeing that in our data obviously they are in the U.S put a huge ground game in place we've trained twenty five thousand field organizers that's five times more than we did twenty sixteen to turn out our vote to educate voters to talk about the results\nAre there's a lot of house races in the balance there's about thirty so the house is going to be neck and neck I think until election day I think that every counts\nTo determine the majority and then the Senate is is breaking our way\nUh in North Dakota and Missouri I was in Indiana this weekend with Mike Brown I mean the energy in the Senate sides great we could definitely pick up seats which is unprecedented in her mid term of a first term president so I feel good about where we are Kavanaugh\nHas definitely energized our base and I'm seeing that in our mail I'm seeing it in our fundraising all across the board it has put a good choice in front of our voters do we really want with the Democrats are offering obstruct resist the smear campaign\nThe the search and destroy it all costs or do we really want a party that's putting forward results that are helping average American families\nAre run on before we let you go the uh the word that in reporting that there is yet another care of on their caravan or two or three caravan\nOf migrants are coming from Guatemala

I'm I'm Sorry they're not the way are they argue buddy middle fascism in America in defense of the a foot line officers of the Portland the they're under orders but I've railed against\nThe upper echelon of these police she's\nSoftness with which they're handling at the end when it shows up they show up prepared for battle they're not covered demonstrators they're nuts counterprotesters they are to search history group an anarchist group and a police state to be more sort of early on\nTo keep the peace\nTo defend like to keep their officers safe and it's not really going on once the crap hits the fan\nWith you a real about this for a long time now the political violence being advocated for by the left and now it's being carried out by this group of thugs and that's what ... is\nThere not the embodiment of anti fascism\nI'm I'm Sorry they're not the way they are they are due buddy mental fascism in America in in defense of the a frontline officers of the Portland the they're under orders but I've railed against the upper echelon of these police agencies softness with which they're handling\nAt the foot and when that shows up they show up\nFor battle they are not counter demonstrators they're not counter protesters they are and insurgency group an anarchist group and the police need to be more sort of early on\nTo keep the peace to defend like to keep their officers safe and it's not really going on and wants to crap hits the fan so to speak or then it's too late so\nI think a different strategy of more of a circus strategy by the Portland pd and all throughout the United states is necessary because we are at the stage now and I I've been saying this for two or three months using the term political violence and people in the ... and they laughed and said it was hyperbole notes not now it's on and\nThis I'm a patriot prayer group that was holding their rally and they had one a couple of months ago and it and to flip did the same damn thing they showed up prepared for battle they\nStart fights they like conflict and like I said a the police are there to\nKeep the peace not let this stuff happened not been but don't break those or fail strategies and until they make it clear with a answer for that their antics are not going to be allowed to go on under the guise of protest because this is not protests I'll tell you what what irks me as well as when\nA commentator is I'm not talking about you but there are commentators are on the right who continued to refer to it\nTo find some of this other political violence is when they're shouting down\nA and intimidating people in a restaurant they keep calling a protest it's not protest it\nIs insurgency answer for calls for the\nKilling of police officers they call for the down fall of the United states lawfully Institute a government\nNow and I know anyone who calls that legitimate protests doesn't know what they're talking about it it's it's intimidation uh it's it's a type of\nOf political extortion too when they do it to the senators and in the elevators I keep saying sheriff Clarke why does he not allowed in the hall to the U.S Senate why should why should people be able to to get within a centimeter from someone else's sane and scream at them\nIn the in the house or the or the capital and actually even be allowed\nRight and but see these groups they realize that not much is going to be done about it and I write you know senators and another congressman congresswoman too you know keep their decorum but then some of this is happening to a private citizens for instance at Trump rallies for instance just this rally held by the\nPatriot prayer group or in Portland, Oregon and I've been saying for a long time to that we have to have more effective counter measures and people say well what does it look like and I can tell people what I Would do and I don't advocate for what anybody else to do but I tell them you're going to think about this now you have to have a plan because they view\nTaking the high road walking away they view that as a sign of weakness in like you said Laurie you hit the nail right on the hit this is designed\nAnd incite fear in people to get them to alter their their votes for public policy that's why I'm calling this political violence it's gone on for too long it's gone too far and and the more that you let this go on the worst is good I mean we should have learned this from the sixties which is the the anarchist movement that ISIS\nThis is happening to private citizens for instance at Trump rallies for instance just this rally held by the\nPatriot prayer group or in Portland, Oregon and I've been saying for a long time to that we have to have more effective counter measures and people say well what does it look like and I can tell people what I Would do and I don't advocate for what anybody else to do but I tell them you're going to think about this now you have to have a plan because they view\nTurning the other cheek taking the high road walking away they view that as a sign of weakness and like you said Laurie you hit the nail right on the hit this is designed to intimidate and incite fear and people to get them to alter their their votes for public policy that's why I'm calling this political\nViolence it's gone on for too long it's gone too far and and the more that you let this go on the worst is get I mean we should have learned this from the sixties which is the\nThe anarchist movement that I studied to know what they're up to to know what their antics are and also know that what they learned out of the sixties law enforcement meaning of what they learned was that those soft masters just lead to more people getting hurt\nMore people getting killed more property damage and they we I Would like to think that we learn that that doesn't work but we are committing the same mistakes or in law enforced\nI agree and I think we're seeing the same results and we'll get into this and just a moment sheriff Clarke at the border with this new caravan caravans approaching the border or so we'll get to that in mind but I Want to play something for you this is from Donna Brazil on ABC's This week and and it was on a panel with Chris Christie and others\nResistance about mom [laughter] about people who do not want the health care about women who want to be listening to when they feel that it's the talk about their prom I set for self not about mob\nYou're running it maybe that would be about ... when we listen to what the Democrats were coming on TV or talking about is talking about in painting Brett Kavanaugh talking about a meeting Donald Trump I and the reason is taking the wheel I agree with Rick Silva mob\nIowa reaction to that\nWell shame on gun in Brazil you know I've met them Brazil\nI'm not too long and we had a great conversation and she told me the true she said the stuff happening on the left as long as she knows it's wrong but see they don't have the courage to call it out when I hear people like her and I hear others not denounce\nThis violence it is a mob and she ought to just admit it but like I said she doesn't have the courage she saw the backlash when she came out with a book that really took the or the DNC the Democratic party to test and she saw the felt the blowback\nRealize she better scurry back on in the ... plantation and that's what she did at the end of her her a book tour but I think that's what she's up to again she needs to exhibit leadership people in the Senate you're not going to get it from Maxine Waters with others in the Senate means exhibit leadership was called this crap all for what it is\nTo tell these people to knock it off but what they do Laura's you know or their tacit approval is comes from the silence and if they do see anything like they try to make that well it's not a mob it's really about health care no it's not she's trying to\nFrame of narrative and I'm ... everybody knows what she's up too but they do it with a wink and a nod when when they tried to ah when they're forced I should say to say that anti ... and some of these other goons this I'm\nA feminist movement when they're pulling their crap you know they do with a wink and a nod when they go well yeah maybe a little bit but you know their their silence just tacit approval to this political violence\nA and sheriff Clarke before we let you go or the Democrats Stacey Abrams in other she's running for governor in Georgia saying that they represent both documented and undocumented\nUm people in this country and left a whole bunch of other groups they claimed to represent a and now we have this\nIt's mad a crash\nBob it's really about health care no it's not she's trying to to frame of narrative and a ... everybody knows what she's up too but they do it with a wink and a nod when when they tried to uh when they're forced I should say to say that anti ... and some of these other goons this I'm a feminist movement when they're pulling their crap\nKnow they do with a wink and a nod when they go well yeah maybe a little bit but you know their their silence just tacit approval to this political violence\nOr and sheriff Clarke before we let you go or the Democrats Stacey Abrams in other she's running for governor in Georgia saying that they represent both documented and undocumented\nUm people in this country and left a whole bunch of other groups they claimed to represent a and now we have this\nIt's mad a crash about to happen again on the southwest border with more caravans of people showing up because you know we basically are just now releasing people who are coming over with the children\nBy this is dangerous to continue they meaning the left they continue to push the envelope on this stuff she doesn't represent undocumented anybody or citizenship is you know means something in this country they're diluting the meaning of citizenship and what citizenship means is that all the rights of privileges\nThat are in the constitution or belong to the United states citizens not non citizens so they're actually taking the citizens of Georgia what she's doing the the residents of the state of Georgia and she's making them second class citizens\nAnd again I'm this Congress must work with the president both on the wall\nAnd of course allowing for immediate turned back at the border sheriff Clarke otherwise we're just going to keep this this keep happening and it's going to be an entire a migration of people from Central America and to this country I completely illegal\nNot wanted by this country not why by the people but but just because they can and they know if they cross the border there no one's in there and no one's going to make 'em leave\nWell they're gonna have to be turned back but I think there's going to be a moment of truth that really is\nA in terms of this administration I support the president's policies on immigration or illegal immigration and you know it is you're you're right it's the Congress who has not moved on this shame on the geo pecan Congress I think they squandered an opportunity here who knows what's going to happen in November but they squandered an opportunity to straighten out\nThis an elite is broken or immigration system\nFinally seal the border that's the first thing that has to be done everything else that that people are proposing follows sealing the border because if you don't seal the border\nWe just saw last week we saw a guy committed some heinous act against the United states citizen a beating has been deported six times lore six we've heard stories of people who've been caught that have\nBeen deported thirty times that's not a made up number but the ... the borders is so poor as they're easily or they can easily get back and so now it's a matter of um you\nKnow the eleventh hour and and I don't know we're going to maintain the house I I Hope when I say we the GOP I Hope they can but if they don't all this stuff is off the table but Democrats are not going to allow that wall to be built they're\nNot going to fix this immigration system they're going to give citizenship\nOr to some measure or to illegal aliens amnesty I'm Talking about and you know of course we have a president that will put a block on that the Senate that will but at the same time we shouldn't be fighting this battle right now we squandered a GOP Senate and house squandered two years for heaven's sakes with a very\nLet's get back and so now it's a matter of um you know the eleventh hour and and I don't know we're going to maintain the house I I I Hope when I say we the Jill ... I Hope they can but if they don't all this stuff is off the table but Democrats are not going to allow that wall to be built they're\nNot going to fix this immigration system they're going to give citizenship\nOr to some measure to illegal aliens amnesty I'm Talking about and you know of course we have a president that will put a block on that the Senate will but at the same time we shouldn't be fighting the battle right now we squandered a GOP Senate and house squandered two years for heaven's sakes with a very", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Cave Creek", "day": "15"}
