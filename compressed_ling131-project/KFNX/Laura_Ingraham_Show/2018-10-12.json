flag Robert release statues none of that creates a one job\nFor African Americans not one job but they beat that drum why why do they beat that drum\nYou're listening to your healthy radio addiction your reaction to Trump flipping the script will it actually result in more African American vote for Republican or at least get them to look twice at the Republican Party\nEight five five forty or I Want to hear your reaction OK so cognac continues after he talks about the the fact that he didn't have a lot of it was basically saying you didn't have a real male role model at home and then he continued\nI Love everyone right but the cats\nJust didn't make me feel a good guy they didn't get to see my dad all the time like a guy\nIt would have thought it was something about when I put his hat off it made me feel like Superman who made\nThat was the favorite superhero and your middle Superman case for me\n\nSo Donald Trump or it's someone who defied the odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is is referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nAll said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get trounced by Jeb Bush they said that uh the Hillary was then going to destroy you it was going to be a member of the all the predictions that Trump would lose in a massive landslide remember that I Do we played 'em every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think is a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump\nFrom it I was taught favors for you and your Superman case for me\n\nSo Donald Trump or as someone who defied the odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is\nIs referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nThey all said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get transpire Jeb Bush they said that\nAh they're Hillary was then going to destroy you and it was going to be a member of the all the predictions that Trump would lose in a massive landslide you remember that I Do we played 'em every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think as a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we know he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think that there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her\nAnd for African American men they love their moms of course a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy and but they he's saying and it's it's probably in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care to I I wanted a male role model to follow\nIn someone who is going to bring male energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just his personal opinion\nI mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off off base Hillary was just really smart and she would have been a bit better president how we obviously no that's not true\nBut you do you notice that Don Lemon et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance economy I brought up let's keep listening to Kanye West like listening\nTo the top of each other I mean someone to help him if the guy them and they need to hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras\nGo get some help and then come back and make your case nobody if you want to be conservative if you want to support Donald Trump that is your business but as you're doing it have some sense with it make sense educate yourself oh wait a second so\nJay Z and Beyonce who were at the\nPresident's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts\nAnd George Clooney because he testified before Congress he used to be all and end all and human rights and in Africa I mean I guess I woke up okay he knows more than all the diplomat and all the people who voted their lives for this well I mean you could raise the question about that right but no one ever did\nThey never raised the question about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to dorm room\n\nKaty Perry running around college campuses it's trying to explain domestic policy to students okay these people wouldn't know a domestic policy of a bit I'm In the back side will take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls\nEight five five forty Laura we'll get to all your calls Kanye West helps Trump and the Republicans flip the script this is a unconventional moves and we'll see if it pays off it certainly is interesting don't go after\n[noise]\nKaty Perry running around college campuses ... trying to explain domestic policy to students okay these people wouldn't know what the method policy if a bit him in the back side will take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls\nEight five five forty ... we'll get to all your calls Kanye West helps Trump and the Republicans flip the script this is a unconventional move and we'll see if it pays off it certainly is interesting don't go after\n[noise]\nThe level of vitriol and fury okay after the cabin our during the Kavanaugh's confirmation process like I I clerked for Justice Thomas on his second year on the court and I was in D.C studying for the bar exam when\nThe Anita Hill hearing happened and there were there were some protests but it was nothing like that it is right now nothing if it's much worse and it's much more seats filled [noise]\nAbsolutely I think I mean the Democratic party that I used to know has gotten hijacked by people who disrupt gearing up uh normally mild mannered senators like Cory Booker proudly proclaim I'm breaking the rules by releasing confidential information during the hearing\nAnd then you see a senators being assaulted in airports run out of restaurants with their spouses and or just people being threatened and you know it wasn't a a gift exchange police and Rand Paul could probably justified\nTo this best but you know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about\nPeople to violence like Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration is the more Congress you nights with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United\nIt's almost like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing they are there more and more angry\nWell as you know war the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court\nThey can't stay on the idea that a President Trump has now pointed to outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as\nOur confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point the president Xi\nI'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think to uh to the uh on attractive or to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean\nThis administration is the more Congress you nights with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United it's almost like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America the only thing they are there more and more angry\nWell as you know or the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court\nAnd they can't stay on the idea that a President Trump has now pointed to outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as\nOur confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point the president's see I'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think to\nUh to the uh unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was an interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenge or the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's listen let me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted to confirm him\nI Would not have we the Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights\nAdjusted to believe in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care than ensures that she can he failed them or an ancient every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed if she were important when she can meet those qualifications\nYour reaction to that\nWell they do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas\nI'm he's out of step with the with Texas values and and this and every other important area mildly suspicion laws he's running for the Democratic nomination for president in twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the hard left\nOr who are who are ah we're seeing a or create these the sort of mob rule\nAnd then it or what is your best cake right now on the Republicans in the mid terms mean you've heard Becker very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the cruise the\nWell I think Ted's in pubs in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this is all about turnout\nWe know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen and mid term elections we usually see a down there in a turnout but uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings have energized our our base and um\nWe've seen people like governor ... and in Tennessee said well he would have voted for\nA cabin all but I'm the truth is\nIf you were what the Democrat this mid term then we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a Chuck turn the Senate over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking at this back on a ... issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on my show senator\nTo discussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pick the\nIncentive to me seems to be still there for that type of circus we saw for Kavanaugh in namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report or or a or a letter or anything confidence\nIf you are what the Democrat this mid term then we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a Chuck turn to send it over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking at this back on the ... issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on my show senator to discussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pick the\nIncentive to me seems to be still there for that type of circus we saw\nFor Kavanaugh in namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report\nOr or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there are no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions really now there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nSo I have a pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter\nThen a leaked the set up to the FBI after the initial um initial hearing than it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee\nSo much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or um\nThis cat's a doctor forge warrior although she certainly didn't serve Dr Ford interests very well in the way she handled all of this\nBut yeah we're gonna we're gonna get to the bottom of this uh uh ... they'll probably be an ethics committee investigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because this is simply unacceptable and thank\nGoodness we didn't reward this with a\nA success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYou know I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward\nThat names when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a collaboration with outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans\nAnd how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their tax messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics an ethics investigation that's fine\nBut there is nothing like an FBI investigation really trace what happened who did it and someone's lying someone dying here\nWell I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction of federal district whether a federal crime was committed here uh I didn't I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps there isn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been\nA federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower income show senator uh for the next ah you know three and a half weeks of this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party is more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands on deck people are working together they're not back biting each other as much human Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the presidents he wants a primary challenge but Michael ...\nI guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction the federal district whether a federal crime was committed here uh I'm I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps there isn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been\nA federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower income show senator uh for the next ah you know three and a half weeks on this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party is more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands on deck people are working together they're not back biting each other as much I mean Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the presidents he won the primary challenge but Marco Rubio said the president will win reelection you haven't had Nikki Haley thinks she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty\nOr what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time or I mean the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darned impressive I Know\nThe mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but\nReally this focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible in which I think uh\nUh that it has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right uh to the right and so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who didn't support either Gorsuch or\nA cabinet or some of the other Democrats on the ballot Catskill McCaskill exactly in Missouri I'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents in the oval office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that uh that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that\nPresident Obama had rappers and other celebrities in the oval office during his time but there is a double standard as we all know uh for this president and uh I just thought it was a I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that

concerned about\nBecause you do something well like you know building a building or we're painting or dancing or singing or acting because you might do that well doesn't mean you have any magical

is that Jim Brown or they're supporting Conyers Jim Brown is a highly respected individual in the black community he is opinionated and outspoken\nAnd the fact that he supported a Kanye and had some

truth I think we've reached a point\nWhere CNN's ratings are higher on the secondary media market than they are in the primary [laughter] eating you're\nMaking the anger and point Laura always said why are we playing Don Lemon he's getting more viewers on my show than he's ever had on his [laughter] that's the point you're making right\nOnly take about forty seven seconds yeah and and I see more show you know edit it down to the nuggets of hate and bitterness and envy\nAnd ... and the things they despise so much on the other shows I think they've reached the point where so few people are watching but they're paying attention playing it elsewhere\nOr to show exactly\nHow out of touch their ratings are lower than the food network\nPeople like ... are reaching an inch and they're bitter and angry about it and it's it's quite amazing\nYeah no that that there there is reality there there's truth\nThe market than they are in the primary [laughter] meaning\nYou're making the anger in point Laura always a wire we'd playing Don Lemon he's getting more viewers on my show than he's ever had on his [laughter] that's the point you're making right\nOnly take about forty seven seconds Josh and and I see more just show you know edit it down to the nuggets of hate and bitterness and envy\n... and the things they despise so much on the other shows I think they've reached the point where so few people are watching but they're paying attention playing it I'll swear or to show exactly how hateful they are and how out of touch their ratings are lower than the food network\nLike ... are reaching an inch\nAnd their return angry about it\nIt's it's quite amazing\nYeah no that that there there is reality there there is truth there um I thank you for the call but\nThere there's no doubt I mean you look at the ratings CNN is just\nIt's tragic I mean it's really tragic and on big nights like during the cabinet battle and things that they they ... they were really hurting I mean in comparison to Fox Fox who's having four six million people watching and CNN had a half a million people\nVery interesting what's happening out there but again it's that runs been exactly to what I was saying a moment ago\nThese elites think they will tell the public what they want and if they keep doing it the public will have nowhere to go but to them the public will eventually get the genius and keep watching it doesn't work that way\nProgramming no longer works that way and there are no longer three networks that hold the monopoly on oil eyeballs in the country and\nWhether it's the people programming ABC with this Roseanne re boots or the folks at CNN shoving Don Lemon down people's throats I just don't think it works it ... it doesn't matter what I think it doesn't work demonstrably probably does not work Chris New Jersey wanted to say what\nI like all of a a Democrat who looked at the low but doesn't agree with their train of thought on the phone call on the\nOn the

of that or is that in like ... ... e that at\nAll oh that's all they got a\nGreat point rate point Chris and it's great and important that you are thinking for yourself thinking outside of whatever identity\nA stick you were supposed to be exemplify and because of your race your sexuality or whatever\nWe all should be thinking for ourselves we all should be free to move to the right or left but

frankly listening to the hatred the racist hatred coming from even members of Kanye West west own race it's appalling what Don Lemon said yesterday and I'm In a play it for you um\nHe invoked ... mother which I thought\nIt is doing what you want it to do yes yes this is great when the puppet cuts the strings then it's a problem\nLook I mean this is why I'm not saying Kanye West is you know a a ... there's an he's not Lincoln here let's not get ahead of ourselves I think\nThere are people on the right who want to suddenly crown Kanye West is the leader of you know African Americans in in
