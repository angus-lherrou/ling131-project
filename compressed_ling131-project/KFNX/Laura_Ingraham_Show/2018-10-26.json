Russian expert he was actually attacked possibly by a a potent cronies present I I ... anti putting stamps and\nHe he specifically said to me no he did not believe that this was a Russian effort this would have been sort of beyond the pale but isn't it interesting\nI have it if you're that Chuck Todd was talking about this uh yesterday on ... on on MSNBC\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operation to designed to do what's happening now more of this you know I think ... and so in some ways we shouldn't allow me to lie to me that area's strange moment and we have no idea where it comes from\nWe have no idea where it comes from it's absolutely true and remember I said context\nIs everything right when we talk about when we talked about uh the Peter Struck leads the page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign contacts with everything that timeline you had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThat same thing can apply here and get knocked conspiracy the horizon again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation very bizarre situation how how do you have ten bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without\n[noise] do what's happening now more of this you know I think we in so in some ways we shouldn't allow me to lie to me that every strange moment and we have no idea where it comes from\nWe have no idea where it comes from is absolutely true and remember I said context\nIs everything right when we talk about when we talked about uh the Peter Struck leads the page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign contacts with everything with that timeline you had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThat same thing can apply here and get knocked conspiracy theorize and again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation\nVery bizarre situation how how do you have an bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without a without a um a post mark on them and without that post mark on them\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting [noise] so that's all at the episode started happening a couple of days ago last week\nLast week the United states and announces\nThat they are pulling out of the intermediate nuclear intermediate range nuclear forces treated the I. N. F. treaty signed by a a signed by I'm a ... President Reagan\nAnd negotiations were pulling out because the Russians are violating that treaty Vladimir Putin's turns around and says if the United states starts deploying missiles in Europe\nThen the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're going to start targeting those countries and that's a that's a very direct threat\nAt the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used to kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the ground\nIn Syria the Russians are not happy about this\nAnd so to me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale and it was an remember the Russians were literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to kill people in Great Britain we notice\nSo ... it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were not that we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what Vladimir Putin wants\nAnd I think it makes it a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or or left wing or\nSending fake bombs through the mail in any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilot editor in chief ... dot com national security columnist for the Washington Times taking your phone calls eight five five\nForty or that if a number of taking your tweets at Andrew underscore lender on Twitter I'm Andrew leg or I Am sitting in for ... [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nCaves when we come back we're going to be joined by John would former air force pilots editor in chief ... dot com national security columnist for the Washington Times taking your phone calls eight five five forty or that it's a number of taking your tweets at Andrew underscore lender on Twitter I'm Andrew longer I Am sitting in for ...\n\n\n\nBut let me talk to you let me let me let me circle back to this rush ... theory that that that you not only did Chuck Todd advances this but I've been thinking about it because I got I got a background in these issues as well mom in you know it's it's it's a situation in which we know what ... wants to do is foment\nAs much to visit and chaos as possible in in American political circles this is what he wants to to do\nI mean given the fact that I Want to talk to you about your thoughts about America pulling out of the INS treaty 'cause you've written about this given the fact that we pulled out of the IMF treaty last week\nOn a and and given the fact that there are Russian soldiers that are being killed on the ground in Syria in there even the barest possibility that this could be an FSB operation a given that the timing of all this or is the time and just to type for it to be that kind of an operation\nBut it is possible I mean what they just sprayed nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah field several people or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders\nAnd for you know the vice president's et cetera are of the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my point you know I have reporters\nAll over the former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that\nThey would do that at this point in time well let me ask you this because getting getting back to this high enough treaty and you've written about and I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it\nUm but ... has now turned around and said that that if the UN starts placing intermediate range missiles in central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can elucidate us on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries I talk so what is it what does that mean\nAnd and how and what does what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the IMF treaty pull out\nWell that that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is going to do except threaten you know the U.S in countries where we may\nThe former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that they would do that\nAt this point in time well let me ask you this because getting getting back to this high enough treaty and you've written about it I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it\nUm but ... has now turned around and said that that if the UN starts placing intermediate range missiles in central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can lose a day that's on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries I talk so what is it what does that mean\nAnd and how ... what does what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the IMF treaty pull out\nWell that that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is he going to do except threaten you know the U.S in countries where we\nMay deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles just like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan with the person to is against the ss twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so when he means by targeting is is really just putting the coordinate sort of Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting part time out those that carry this\nTime and this is so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit is literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he he what could I mean\nMy point of that article is that we've seen this all before then this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia can keep up with us economically especially under the Trump academy which in two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and then I noticed he went to the United nations and\nThe you know tried to drum up support there to force us to not what'd you off and the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations that you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with and had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more uniform or us air force pilot or he is a national security columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it'll go up on on more as a a Web site\nCertainly will go up on the Andrew anger show page on Facebook so go and check that out there explaining what's a little bit about what ... dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\nYeah I Know I had a long history or in Russia studied it at the air force academy the language I you know learned about the Soviet Union flying for the airports I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that the west especially Americans in you know middle America or don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI have built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point and and you and I own a lot of talk more about this because I was obviously Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn languages are you at the very least I Need to brush up on my Russian so I I'm always looking for people to talk to us but the hottest show dog she was on a show [laughter]\nSo but my my question a lot of sleep people what they don't understand is that is that this is really it's not for ... and it's not about\nReestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about ... the trappings of the Russian Empire and and all you're exactly\nRight until the end of things like me\nWell ... thank you but you got ... [laughter] I think it was fun Super Bowl show ya [laughter] playing that a little bit explained to explain what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks\nWe're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point and and you and I own a lot of talk more about this because I was I was a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn the language are you at the very least I Need to brush up on my Russian so I I'm always looking for people to talk to the show dog [laughter] watching how to show [laughter]\nI felt my but my my question and a lot of sleep people what they don't understand is that is that this is really it's not for ... and it's not about\nReestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about reestablishing the trappings of the Russian Empire and and\nAll you're exactly right until the end of things like me\nWell ... thank you but you got ... [laughter] I think it was fun Super Bowl ... claim that a little bit explained to explain what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\nWell I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a port roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah it'll exist today as a monument and so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union\nWas one of the most productive successful countries they said do you\nReally have the world with their economy on their agriculture\nAnd adjust now a hundred years later I\nGot back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union said to them that destroyed them economically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet um you know the full civic revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want to happen here so we write a lot about that\nBut I mean this is this is why this this changing stance visa V. Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual the the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strengths it's not quite that but the Russians have to respect\nYour ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I mean don't I mean that that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to do with my right\nOf course and if you want collusion I mean the Obamas or their their entire administration on down with the ones that colluded with Russia and still probably are in some ways\nUh you you look at a uranium so you know those sales you look at what's going on with the Trump dossier cetera I mean there was an intricate interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate and and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still or they don't want to I guess\nTaught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good working and doing well how do I get in touch with you want I Want to talk with you\nUh well I don't you can always go to ... dot com T.

that one of the earlier callers which was hinting at\nWhich is sort of these false flag operations I I'm Sorry I'm not going to call it that we step back I don't mean that in what I mean is that you have Democrats who will\nPerpetrate these kinds of crimes as a way of raising the stink you know I'm a there was a a feminist activist\nIn Wyoming or who had claimed that she was being threatened to turn that she was sending threatening emails to herself or the same thing happened just recently with another democratic activists to on a college campus or you know this issue of folks who who claimed to put up\nI'm the founder of anti Semitic graffiti are only to racist graffiti only to find out that it was in fact done by the people who they're going to lose one we've seen this happen before\n[noise] so that's why I tend to discount of these things I Love to go to a let's go to I'm Mike in Texas Mike welcome to the war Ingram show\nThank you a question that should be at is the one

I Love to go to a let's go to I'm Mike in Texas Mike welcome to the war Ingram show\nThank you a question that should be at the one that we heard many on overnight got five weeks ago by liberal under our during the cabin on hearing or that one who benefit\nFrom that not a word for it couldn't accurately and testify again so I Would act even though I disagree with that on it completely that going back their own ... who benefits from the delivery how\nAre you\nAnti Trump people what course it's the lack of course it is and I agree with the last caller there was never any attempt to hurt anybody it's obviously\nA question has to be asked\nIf it's a Latin mental and questioned in in in in the law cui bono who who who to whom is there a benefit to this and I think you are you are correct in that regard I mean this is the again if it fits in with ... razor here\nI'm In a you know the the simplest explanation is usually the correct one and I know I I've said that a couple of different times but I Want to make sure that a hammer that point home so that we talk about these things um but that's also why I I Do think that we cannot discounts\nWe cannot discount or that the Russians might be involved here in some way shape or form it's interesting when I had this conversation or a yesterday with a a Russia expert who who did tell me he did not think\nDid not think that the FSB the Russian foreign intelligence service was involved in this he did nevertheless say but on the other hand there is strong evidence to indicate\nThat those are ... you know the cameraman and his brother up as your car up in Boston that they may very well have been trained in influenced by the Russians\nThat they are all sorts of weird things that were going on with their radicalization and and that the way that they built this they're bomb the pressure cooker bomb it's not something that would have been readily available on the Internet and so that that I found fascinating\nThere is a real benefits\nAre real benefit a continuing benefits to a lot of foreign powers or by this continued a discontent in a in the United states affect somebody tweeted it I don't have it in front of me you know or that the Russians would very much like Democrats in power I that's true to an extent\nBut to what the Russians are really wants is they want chaos or my thank you very much for the call

F. N. acts\nWe don't eat and lock up our pantry not face a lot in there I'm a child and an immigrant but you gotta come legal way\nWell and and listen and we got this uh on on the Twitter line here I'm at Andrew underscore linger on Twitter from an imaginary Adam on Twitter the only bombs we should be talking about is the caravan bumped here's here's all reality right\nAnd again the the thing that makes America great one of the things that make makes America exceptional is that anybody can come here legally and become an American it is the beauty of who we are as a nation that being said\nBorder security is an essential aspect of sovereignty if you don't protect your borders you lose the U.S with Stanley McChrystal General Stanley McChrystal not some you know right wing bomb thrower was on CNN this morning talking about a ... he was asked about the caravan and one of the things really said was that a a\nA a border security is an essential aspect of sovereignty\nAnd your uh it's clear your constituents in your potential constituents get that why is it that but what is your opponents say about this I won't get away our power how would the Democrats in the district taking this\nSo my opponent Joe Cunningham rough and mayor of Los Angeles are setting\nHere to campaign wow do I need to go any further\nDo you really you really don't I mean that that seems to you know it's one of those things I often talk about you know when you do public speaking you have to know who your audience is I Can't imagine that a guard said he from LA played well in the first congressional district of South Carolina\nIt's just because it let's be brutally honest with everybody on on the right yeah Democrats don't have a platform is year not to say in the past Democrats haven't had something\nBut of sovereignty and your uh it's clear your constituents near potential constituent ... why do you do that but what was your opponents say about this ah ... we're going to Howard Howard how well the Democrats in the district taking this\nSo my opponent Joe Cunningham rough and mayor of Los Angeles Garcetti here to campaign why do I need to go any further\nDo you really you really don't I mean that that seems you know it's one of those things I often talk about you know when you do public speaking you have to know who your audience is I Can't imagine that a girl from LA played well in the first congressional district of South Carolina\nIt's just because it let's be brutally honest with everybody on on the right you know Democrats don't have a platform\nIs year not to say in the past Democrats haven't had something good but they don't have anything to talk about we should be focusing on the fact that we had the best economy we had in generation do yeah the lowest them wind that ever and\nIf people don't see that they I I just can't put my arms around it but I Believe that Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are toxic to this country\nAre toxic they're all about the rhetoric is all about the negativity they embody the exact opposite of what an American should be we should stand proud and strong together\nAs a country my ... my dose of South Carolina state representative to ... and she's the Republican candidate for Congress in the first congressional district on and on that point you know nobody ... obviously off the front pages today\nBut this was we got a the the third quarter GDP a measurements today we knew we were going to be getting those obviously nobody is talking about them or because of um ah ah because of the other things that are in the news the suffering bomb story\nOr and and we now have a a GPA of three point five percent of the third quarter\nA President Obama when he was in office said we were never going to the\nGDP above two percent of the Trump McConnell you're turning that around obviously this is very important to other folks you're talking to the seasons in terms of jobs and more money in their pockets are how are they on the sort of the the Trump tax and regulatory agenda one of those same to you about that\nWell they all love more money in our pockets Trump the you know tax agenda is positive it's up to Congress to get tax judo path we need to ensure that small businesses and\nThe middle class get\nPermanent tax relief absolutely paramount we have to do that that is that's going to be a huge focus on going in that fashion but other than that when you know we're looking at the regulatory you know I have some big manufacturers in my area\nOf bowling being one of them shore and they just four hundred new people the tariffs no one likes a tariff no one likes the terrorists but President Trump is standing firm and putting America First and that it's imperative we need to remember that this is the world's best negotiator let demand do his job\nYou don't regulate it got no no go ahead go ahead please reducing organizations\nAnd using ... to let businesses thrive is what we need to do I mean we ... government the fundamental belief and I'll get Senator Tom Davis and the state of South Carolina credit for this one because he told it to me and it's been part of my ... a\nDemocrat fundamentally believe government is to set up problem and Republican believe government is the problem and\nThat is what Trump is doing the government's the problem is getting rid of it finally with Congress working with him on that and we have to keep the momentum going it is paramount I was my what\nThe tariff but President Trump is standing firm and putting America First and that it's imperative we need to remember that this is the the world's best negotiator let the man do his job you don't regulate it got\nNo no go ahead go ahead please producing organizations\nAnd using ... to let businesses thrive is what we need to do I mean we ... government the fundamental belief and I'll get Senator Tom Davis and the state of South Carolina credit for this one because he told it to me and it's been part of my ... a\nDemocrat fundamentally believe government is to set up problem and Republicans believe government is the problem and that is what Trump is doing the government's the problem is getting rid of it finally we've got Congress working with him on that and we have to keep them a mental going it is paramount I was my what\nI like ... as my colleague at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Wayne Cruz says you don't have to teach the grass how to grow you just have to remove your walk marijuana and he's already been ... that sort of by one of my other Bailey works is is the is this your regulations\nBut but you know it's interesting because you talk about this issue of negotiation and and and Trump [noise]\nUm I I have a I've formulated a theory on what I called Trump's rules of acquisition I'm a star trek Duke uh this is a friend using the ... rules that accusation and rule number one is always be willing to walk away from the table\nRight rule number two is sometimes in order to demonstrate your opponent\nYou're willing to walk away from the table you have to walk away from the table and will number three is don't pre negotiate with yourself I mean this is\nThis is the great folly of a of a you know democratic negotiators crude negotiators over the years is that they've always pre negotiated individually inevitably sold out American interests\nAnd so we argue understand probably bowling you're happy about a tariff on let's say a looming them or see or what have you but nevertheless it is any go shooting to to to take the strongest position don't you think\nOh absolutely and we need to remind ourselves that that you know I look at what we're going through right now it's like a child getting inoculated we know they're going to have a fever for a day you're going to be a little bit cranky for a minute\nThey're going to live a lifetime and never get sick\nThey have to prepare ourselves I mean this is it it it really is our country group we are the greatest nation on this planet because of hard work severe and and the guts to stand tall\nAnd we need to do that right now China is not our friend they're never going to be our friends and

forest service [noise] anyway\nThis is not that unusual when you consider the characteristics of east packages [noise] um I don't I have received things in the mail personally that are the things that I'm like oh what a calculator or something with stamps on there that have not been cancelled wow what reason or not\nAnd Andrew is because those are called SP ours which stands for small parcels in roles that can't go through the processing machine sure when you get a letter that goes through the machine\nA machine just spray it the cancellation on there for efficiency and speed it doesn't do that with those types of packages had those packages had a pipe and they're not a PVC pipe but the actual lead pipe or something\nThat could do damage yes it would have waited too much and it would've alerted people that there's something wrong with this it's not a gone through cork a clerk at the counter will look at it ask a bunch of questions and hand cancel those there's a stamp sure so\nFor the fact that they're not canceled there's not that unusual\nWell let me ask you this and ... who are running short on time here but real quick so it without it being cancelled how would they be able to track them back from New York to Florida\nWell I think that's probably a a they're basing it on the fact that one of them was mailed and then ended up with a Rick being returned to Florida I'm I'm I'm not exactly sure how they got FBI is a lot more clever than I Will [laughter]\nWell there's been some other listen I appreciate that that is that is incredibly helpful information and in the end

...\n\n\nCommon sense independent talk eleven hundred KFI next but true voices of Arizona independent talk eleven hundred KF ...\nWas an I think that's a very good idea or you can simply use the same logic and legal framework of the travel ban against a those countries which are failed states for terrorism reasons\nOr we can apply that and it looks like that's going to happen to these countries and the reason that's important is right now under US law is crazy but if a Mexican comes across illegally or he or she can be repatriated almost immediately\nBut if you're not from a continuous country shore um Central America that's not the case it's a crazy loophole that needs to be fixed um but in the meantime what can we do then to repatriate them if they actually do get across\nA through executive order I think that that makes a lot of sense to effectively make it an extension of travel ban but I think Andrew here's the bigger point I don't want to have that confrontation less incentivized Mexico and find something else to make kind of threatened or threatened Mexico\nTo take care of this problem because they should for too long Mexico has not been acting look Mexico's a friend and ally but they're not acting like an on this issue and they have gladly pass the buck and allowed in facilitated these caravans to go north and become our problem well they've got to do their part\nWell this is part of it we have leverage on them and protect me via trade\nWhat happened I'm Sorry no no but this is what's happening in Europe I mean let's not forget that a lot of our friends in Europe are struggling to sort of the same issues of mass migration and you have a situation in which you have migrants refugees from the middle east coming in arriving in Greece\nBut in the meantime what can we do then to repatriate them if they actually do get across a through executive order I think that that makes a lot of sense to effectively make it an extension of travel ban but I think Andrew here's the bigger point I don't want to have that confrontation\nLess incentivized Mexico and find something else to make kind of threatened or threatened Mexico\nTo take care of this problem because they should for too long Mexico has not been acting look Mexico's a friend and ally but they're not acting like an on this issue and they have gladly pass the buck and allowed in facilitated these care of it has to go north and become our problem well they've got to do their part\nWell this is part of it we have leverage on them and protect me via trade\nAs it is what happened I'm Sorry no no but this is what's happening in Europe I mean let's not forget that a lot of our friends in Europe are struggling to sort of the same issues of mass migration\nAnd you have a situation in which you have migrants refugees from the middle east coming in arriving in Greece and they will be facilitated in crossing certain countries so that those countries can get them out of their their continue was ... ... it's interesting you talk about this\nIs talk of the issues of national security and I've been down to the southern border and I urge anybody in every one if you've never been down to the border go down to the border in in uh in Arizona and California\nAnd watch you know there's highway that travel right along the border I Want to say five five I don't remember I Know it's on I think that that goes north south I think it's high ten interstate ten goes right along the border there\nAnd I've watched people cross the border it is a scary prospect even if people are not coming you know into commit harm but the idea of something like a simple walk across the patch of land and and my great that that is a frightening prospect to me then I'm thinking as he was on the eve\nOf course and by the way you know people want to make us seem like we're a xenophobic\nA you know paranoid people because we talk about uh the the danger of a lawless for of course border here's the reality the president wasn't far off by the way when he said that you know there could be middle Easterners or for example we had no idea it was causing here's what we do know\nAnd this is a conspiracy theory nonsense isn't from some far right a website\nThe Laredo station of the border patrol tells us that this year they have already arrested six hundred and Bangladeshis are crossing illegally not why do I mentioned that because obviously Mexico's a very long way from what I'm saying that that also happens to be a country that has a real problem with Islamic terrorists\nOr so there are reasons for us to to fully that anyone coming here from Bangladesh you know even coming legally but the fact that they're coming illegally through Mexico I think it's very I sure and tells us you know that that we don't know who's kind would be caught six hundred how many have we not caught um so it doesn't make sense for economic security\nIt doesn't make sense for national security it's not fair to legal immigrants there are just so many reasons why we have to stop it and I think we need to get Mexico\nTo do their part we need to use trade as the leverage and say we're going to start trade restrictions and by the way it it that doesn't work if it comes to it we will see all this border there will be no trade from Mexico I Hope we don't have to get back to ...\nBut I think that option has to at least be on the table so that we don't have the prices of them actually crossing the border walking across as happens too often as you mentioned\nAnd by the way the interested that I was looking for the interstate eight in the south of interstate panic goes right along the border in Arizona and California and my guess is the Cortez and we're talking about this it it's funny because I I come back to the Senate thing about being a phobia and I I Want to also make it very clear I said that's a little bit earlier on on the show\nBut one of the one of the great things about America the thing that makes America the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth is affected anybody can come to America and become an American\nRight that that is that is an essential element of who we are it's a wonderful thing it's something you can't find anywhere else so you go just about anywhere else that you go in the world but I can move to ...\nThere will be no trade from Mexico I Hope we don't have to get better Kony in but I think that option has to at least be on the table so that we don't have the prices of them actually crossing the border walking across as happens too often as you mentioned\nAnd by the way the interstate that I was looking for the interstate eight in the south of interstate panic goes right along the border in in Arizona and California um I guess the Steve Cortez and we're talking about this it it it's funny because I I come back to ... percent of the thing about being a phobia and I I Want to also make it very clear I said that's a little bit earlier on on the show\nBut one of the one of the great things about America the thing that makes America the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth is affected anybody can come to America and become an American\nRight that that is that is an essential element of who we are it's a wonderful thing it's something you can't find anywhere else the you go just about anywhere else that you go in the world but I can move to France today\nI could live in ... in France for another Thirty years I Will never be considered French Japan that same thing Korea the same thing but anybody can come to America and and become an American it's the beauty of who we are we're just saying that you have to do it within the process you have to do it legally you and you cannot expect\nIf you're going to come up here on mobs\nAnd and do something about it so the president is talking about deploying troops down to the southern border\nUm there is a lot of discussion as to whether or not this
