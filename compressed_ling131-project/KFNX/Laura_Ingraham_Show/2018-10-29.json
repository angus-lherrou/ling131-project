this is ridiculous the uh you know Trump made one one comment and a and I I've I forget it was in response to a question which elicited this where one could be done\nYou said it would be ... have been helpful if there was a security guard in the synagogue\nThere was security guards and lots of synagogues perfectly wise recommendation\nGovernment tech by the Democratic mayor of Pittsburgh the

is out there a will kill a and a synagogue and other other centers schools should be defended but the Democrats\nThan the left are so few ranged over gun control issues that practical steps like this are hard to take\nWell I think that's the case and the former rabbi a of the synagogue a live tree of life synagogue\nWas also interviewed and again I'm not blaming anyone in the aftermath of this because people are so upset about the media really dragging this into a political conversation and trying to tie Trump's entire world view\nThis evil anti he was an anti Trump\nA fanatic that the

so greatly let's listen\nTo you welcome the president to Pittsburgh in the wake of this I Do not welcome the president to him I said hey why not because he's the purveyor of hate speech\nOr the hypocritical um words that come from him um tell me nothing\nUm we have a we have very very strong leadership and the city is believing values not just Jewish value of leaving values and those are not the value of the fact that that and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh or the current\nUh rent or you know ... forgive me for saying this but I said as the ... the Jews are out to lunch with these issues that first of all Donald Trump was the first woman to be attacked the Donald Trump ... ah you know is of counter punch it basically\nAnd he doesn't spew hate for any group nothing like I mean I turn\nIt on MSNBC the other day or the Cold War said the panel every single day there were four people on that\nCritical um where'd that come from him um tell me not saying\nI'm we have a we have very very strong leadership and the city is believing values not just Jewish value leaving values and and you're not the value of the fact that hats and I do not welcome him to testify or the current\nEvent that you know ... forgive me for saying this but I say this in June the Jews are out to lunch on this these issues that first of all Donald Trump was the first woman to be attacked the Donald Trump ... uh you know is a counter punch it basically\nAnd he doesn't spew hate for any group nothing like I mean I turn\nOn MSNBC the other day a on it and the code well set a panel\nEvery single day there were four people on the panel was the Trump it said I\nI'm a nationalist and every single one of them linked that the adults Hitler why because they were in every one of them said nationalist is dictator well actually no I chose this mess see any\nOf the nineteenth century figure who created the modern state of Italy he's the one who claim nationalism\nIs a Democrat they just won't find any pretext to link Trump to Hitler a Lawrence O'Donnell on CNBC you said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist it's white\nAnd then that translates into Hitler\nThey have against Trump dwarfs anything that you could say that Trump Trump Trump is kind of actually funny it is a tax 'em and light light hearted and everybody understands what he's doing a but these people they have dug themselves into a whole here\nAnd they they continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time since Abraham Lincoln that the Democratic party or any major party ads are gone to war against the legitimate Lee elected president resistance\nWhich is what Schumer and Pelosi call their up campaign of obstruction is not a legitimate function in a democracy\nFor political party ... we have a sister both compromise we have a system where there's a peaceful transition of power and you wait for the next election\nAnd that translates normally into a honeymoon that Gallup estimates is about seven months Trump didn't get seven seconds they were boycotting is inauguration there were calling for his impeachment the hate is coming from people like this rabbi\nOh who insist on demonizing the president of the United states which is something it hurts all Americans here's our commander in chief and you know they did that the Bush to that quote Bush Hitler\nThe Democratic party is out of control and off the rails and or the you know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that\nUntil a ... there are

are now moving toward you they're panicking on the left clearly but what what ... what one issue do you think is most important\nI think it's protecting Florida trajectory and I'm a candidate who is going to build up the success that Florida's had in terms of our economy\nAndrew Gillum wants to forty percent tax increase but I think voters know that will destroy our economic momentum I'm also a candidate that has a really solid plan to fix some of the environmental and water quality problems they look at Andrew Gillum is somebody that wants to impeach Donald Trump\nHow are you going to be able to get these problems solved with require consultation with the federal government\nOr if you're out there saying the guy should be peace I think they know I'll be able to get this stuff done and

that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum is uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who openly attacked law enforcement so I think people are looking at safe

be able to get these problems solved with require consultation with the federal government\nOr if you're out there saying the guy should be peace I think they know I'll be able to get this stuff done

Bill Nelson of course is running for Senate reelection Senate ah in Florida how concerned are you about\nThe allure of President Obama has rock star quality and helping your opponent\nSo I'm a I think he's going to end up turning more votes out for me than he does for\nFor Andrew because I think folks will ah who may not otherwise one vote if they see Obama's for Andrew they're going to want to support me I'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal cozying up to the Castro regime being very weak\nOr when it comes to the Missouri but durable regime and Venezuela so I welcome President Obama how I should be paying for his travel expenses that come down\nAnd don't forget you know we have the president\nOf the United states coming down on October thirty first\nUh to Fort Myers in southwest Florida and then likely come again before the election happens and so you know you look at that rally that he did for Ted Cruz in Texas\nUm you know that put the race away for cat that I think we'll get a similar outcome here um after he comes down to Florida for me\nWell Gillum is a silver Tunde order I mean that's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice today I'm about about my political opponents but he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric ties to he tries to do the cool thing that Obama does\nI I don't think he doesn't do it nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last debate with you for our listeners let's listen\nMy grandmother used to say I have a dog will holler\nMiss it at Santa spoken a first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day he had spoken at races conferences not calling this the defense of races I'm simply saying the race it believe he's the races\nAnd of course the our our\nLovely is over and MSNBC et cetera said oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today\nOn there was a piece in a Breitbart today that of course these boycott honors of Israel these anti Israeli organizations supporting Gillum the ... you know he's not sign this\nPledge called dream defenders I'm I planted my support to the freedom papers in the freedom papers are of course I'm also advocate textbook socialist principles the virtue of being born each of us is the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera\nUh and it goes on and on and of course I'm anti Israeli groups supporting Gillum honey respond\nYeah like I mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous um and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bearer on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody\nOf Israel these anti Israeli organizations supporting Gillum the ... you know he's not sign this\nPledge called dream defenders I'm I planted my support to the freedom papers and the freedom papers are of course I'm also

supporting Gillum honey respond\nWell yeah like I mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous\nUm and he keeps going back to that because I think the covered his bear on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida values\nAndrew is the one who is aligned themselves with the dream defenders they are openly antagonistic to Israel they support boycott divested sanction\nOf the state of Israel they actually organized boy or a flash mob protest in Israel they take special trips\nOr just the target Israel on and so what we're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip and so he's way out of step on that um and I would never accept an endorsement from a group a that boycotted Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement is racist they say the police and prisons have no place injustice um and that law enforcement should be defined that so that's what he said\nIn terms of the pledge he signed on that I think that that is just way outside of what is acceptable or in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago new Andrew Gillum documents show FBI agent might have paid for fundraising dinner and of course that's the FBI agent is part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption\nAnd turns out you know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks but when it Gillum fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nWell that's right so he said just last Sunday when we did the CNN debate when I was confronting them about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff\nWell then it turns out just a couple of days later there was a text message just showing he acknowledge that this price the thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton was\nActually paid for by and undercover FBI agent who he thought was a with a local real estate developer and then it comes out just a couple of days ago that that same undercover FBI agent posing as a developer under wrote an almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Guillain nascent governor campaign and indeed Andrew did not\nUm disclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with Florida law so he goes around saying that he's not been investigator isn't being investigated\nBut I Would ask the question what other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece and its palms with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating deal um that'd be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nThe ... I only went down to some really simple in these last closing dance is just sleazy this is sleazy politics as usual bribes or people people dangling little benefits in politics\nThe developer under wrote it almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner for Guillain Nathan governor campaign and indeed Andrew did not disclose that expenditure and so he didn't even complied with Florida law so\nGoes around saying that he's not been investigator isn't being investigated but I Would ask the question\nWhat other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece and its problems with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating deal that would be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nWith ... ...

next\nFascinating race Joe Manchin of course is a Democrat incumbent senator or any supported the president here and there but overwhelmingly on the big issues still uh except for Kavanaugh we receive mansion not supporting conservative causes\nThat's led a state attorney general West Virginia Patrick Morrisey or to ah be on the verge of defeating the ... in ... but we still have a week to go he joins us now uh it's good to have you on Mr Morsi how're you\nDoing great Laurel thanks for having me on your program today\nAbsolutely a let's talk about the effort to blame the president his rhetoric his language for this horrific attack on the synagogue\n[noise] well I I think this is just another example of what we've been seeing all all you have a resistance obstruction impeachment caucus that's basically on Capitol Hill and the house and in the Senate and you have Hillary Clinton who says she's incapable of civility you have all these radicals\nThat they're only goal is to bring this press that Daryl and they're going to take the most outrageous positions whatever Trump says\nThey're going to take the opposite position and that's not right and you have to have respect for this president who has done so much to restore America the credibility aboard if you look at Israel this is a president\nAbsolutely a lot to talk about the effort to blame the president his rhetoric his language for this terrific attack on the synagogue\n[noise] well I I think this is just another example of what we've been seeing all fall you have a resistance obstruction impeachment caucus that's basically on Capitol Hill in the house and in the Senate\nAnd you have Hillary Clinton who says she's in capable of civility you have all these radicals\nThat they're only goal is to bring this president doubt as they're going to take the most outrageous positions whatever Trump says\nThey're going to take the opposite position and that's not right and you have to have respect for this president who has done so much to restore American credibility aboard if you look at Israel this is a president that it's been a staunch ally of Israel and actually had the guts\nTo go and follow through to make Jerusalem or the capital in terms of locating the embassy this was huge but\nThey will find any way to pick at President Trump\nFortunately in West Virginia President Trump has a lot of support he won the election by forty two points when\nI get elected I'm going to be a conservative fighter for President Trump's agenda and separately\nReason why people were fleeing from Joe mansion is he's another dishonest Washington liberal he's open borders he supports these radical leaders Chuck Schumer would be as first vote in the Senate and West Virginians are very concerned about returning to the Clinton Obama years and that's why we're going to win this race\nWell why um why would they Democrat ever have much of a chance in the state of West Virginia when Donald Trump won the state by what forty point something like that\n[noise] well forty two points and and I think the reason why ... is\nReally slipping dramatically in the polls is that as we've been able to get our message out and contrast that let them know what the people know that on all the issues that matter not only maps and simply stuff Hillary in Obama a match is not pro life a match and supports Planned Parenthood\nMatch and supports radical gun control West Virginians don't like that and I think one of the worst things of all is that Joe Manchin doubled down his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said\nWe're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work so Joe mansion and the more people learn about his actual record not his rhetoric because for what he does is he says one thing in\nWest Virginia something completely different in Washington DC the more people learn about dishonest\nWashington liberal ... action they move away from 'em so it's an education process\nWhat about the um issues of just basic fairness that we saw a rise after the\nKavanaugh I'm hearing Joe Manchin a voted for cabin on the end but a man\nThat I think most people just saw that as just an example of rank unfairness and treating some time treating someone who is it 'cause he says you know they were guilty just because they were accused\n[noise] well I think that's right and I for folks following at home when you know the Joe mansion literally waited on his name was first call on the Senate floor\nMatch and took a powder and in fact he only came back to the vote effort Susan Collins declared her position and whatever people think about the cabinet vote West Virginia's should cast a vote there should be the leadership at West Virginia so\nJoe Manchin could have defused this whole craziness this impeachment circus this obstruction a craziness that we saw if he had come out just a little bit earlier for\nKavanaugh we know that Feinstein held that material\nI mean I think most people just saw that as just an example of rank unfairness and treating some ... treating someone who's ... says you know they were guilty just because they were accused\n[noise] well I think that's right and I for folks following at home when you know that Joe mansion literally waited on his name was first call on the Senate floor\nMatch and took a powder and in fact he only came back to the vote effort Susan Collins declared her position or whatever people think about the cabinet vote West Virginia should cast a vote there should be leadership out of West Virginia so\nJoe mansion could have defused this whole craziness this impeachment circus this obstruction a craziness that we saw if he had come out just a little bit earlier for\nKavanaugh we know that Feinstein held that material for months why because she wanted to play politics with the Supreme Court nominee Joe mansion aided in the bed it Feinstein and Schumer by waiting giving the maneuvering room I think that's the word they used\nThat's what the problem is a guy like Joe mansion you know he may appear to be more moderate and rhetoric but in reality when you're first vote is to empower these\nRadicals then you can't be considered moderate he is a dishonest washing the liberal and more and more voters are learning that\nLet's talk about the economy in West Virginia the president decided early on that he was going to try to do what he could to reinvigorate the coal miners their way of life\nAnd yet he's ridiculed even today I Can't remember I saw it but just today for his comments about clean coal Patrick\n[noise] yeah I think many people realize that the president has really follow through on his promises to the people West Virginia let's start with coal as many people listening no I let that twenty seven state coalition\nDefeat Obama's coal killing rights at the U.S Supreme Court\nBut that that is served as a bridge to President Trump and then he follow through on his promises\nWhich were on some of those crazy unlawful rules and that's putting some miners backdoor now look we have a long way to go but you're starting to see a lot more activity in the energy area and that's directly related to the optimism people have with the Trump presidency but it goes beyond that\nThe Trump tax cuts are very beneficial for West Virginia not only a doubling of the standard deduction and the lowering of the rates but in West Virginia we have fifty five of these opportunities always which are going to allow impoverished communities to lift up and reach their potential that's\nHuge and that's credit to President Trump Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts and he\nKind of goes back and forth and say well he was open that he wasn't the reality is he voted no he voted the wrong way because Chuck Schumer wouldn't let them vote for and that's not the kind of leadership we need but we are seeing\nA resurgence in West Virginia and you have to give this president credit for so many of the good things he's done on taxes on regulatory relief on picking rule of law judges that instills confidence in the system which allows\nA entrepreneur is to spend more of their capital\nOr we are going to be covering this race very closely over the next to seven days election day next week but you can vote early in West Virginia correct\nYes in fact ah
