the Senate and on the steps of the Supreme Court um this is what Maxine Waters says she was asked last night about the uh intimidation and the harassment\nOf senators and sort of getting it right in someone's face as a means of protest and she said this\nWhen we protests yet which shouting out we have signed we're saying what we think we'll get to the public and we are not saying we're going to tell anybody and we're going to hit anybody oh we're going to cause anybody harm that's a lot in the way that they're trying to redefine protest\nIs is that correct I mean what your thoughts on the [noise]\nWell my thoughts are this\nThat public officials and and I I'm not a perfect public official but I think we all ought to set an example of civility and so for US Senator say get in their face\nFor congresswoman like her to say get in your face\nAnd then what happens is uh the president's press secretaries and Senator Cruz or pushed out of restaurants that are surely that is encouraged by what are these congresswoman and senators are saying and it's wrong or I Believe in\nA freedom of association freedom of speech\nFreedom to demonstrate but it ought to be peaceful and you shouldn't do anything that's going to encourage\nViolence because even if or a congresswoman doesn't intend violence there's some people that are going to take it one step further than she intended and she needed to back off about ... steps and a and not\nFor surely not be in your face if you're going to have a democratic and representative government function properly uh I got to be a ... you know a

violence\nThere's some people that are going to take it one step further than she intended and she needed to back off about ... steps and a and not\nSurely not be in your face if you're going to have a democratic and representative government function properly\nUh I got to be a ... you know a few feet away we got to have a a discussion a dialogue I got to have respect for people that disagree with me and she ought to respect for people that disagree with our but in your face is in a way to do it\nWell she said a year ago that she was going to take Donald Trump out\nAnd what does that mean let me see that this I'm lesbian or gay algae Beatty dinner and she goes into take him out that she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner and she's like take him out and\nTelling people that are getting harassed in restaurants and\nIt seems like that that message really has terminated the permanent protest a mentality in the Democratic party senator and and my concern is that someone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steve ... get shot you would've thought that the that the Democrats would have calmed everyone down after that\nBut when you have Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator\nIt's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered an elevator but then you have poor old Susan Collins and people being ... screen data centimeter from their face while they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean what can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office and in in public places and we're confronted with that and they're doing it under what they think is First Amendment rights the only thing you can count on his police protection and we have but then you can't have police protection\nFor four five hundred and thirty five members of Congress every place they are spread throughout the United states even relying upon local police\nOr you can't do that as well so are are are I've come to the conclusion and this repetitive of\nWhatever kind of already said to you but are a democracy will be a stronger a whiz respectful political discourse as opposed to what is happening or when you a quote unquote get in their face\nWell what what senator what responsibility does something like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or\nKamala Harris have to to speak against this type of\nHarassment and intimidation isn't just carrying assigning and chanting some things this is cornering women in elevators this this is something and we have\nWe have people threatening to kill Kavanaugh teachers in Minnesota I mean people are taking this all the hard if you if you say someone's like a combination of not seeing a sexual predator enough times\nSome way I could do it all is gonna you know take take matters into his or her own hands God help us so what responsibility does the Democrat leadership have here\nUh I don't think they're going to exercise but they gotta they gotta responsibilities renounce it\nNo I Would I Would I'm waiting for that ah I'm waiting for that undergrad there go ahead\nYou wait a long time I think I'm going to [laughter]\nSenator Grassley a the lessons learned from this Kavanaugh\nSay that it's a shame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what senator Heitkamp then\nYou're obviously in the midst of a very tough reelection fight and I know you you feel voting the way you did was the right way do you worry are you concerned that may have cost you your sentences\nAt the end of the day still have to look at yourself in the mirror and think about what your\nFuture holds compromise or something like this based on politics and I I Believe the smoke would have compromised um my true belief that um this person did not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court they're still repeating\nThat the temperament issues Senator Grassley\nHe listened this gets back to what I already told you got twelve successful years on the uh the DC circuit the second most important a court in the land and he's been college all or even people like Garland\nA said that he had that sort of a approach to judging and that means judicial temperament and not only are you have a personality that is a temperate you also leave your personal views out of\nOut of a decision making you\nLook at the law and look at the facts of the case and just to use those two things to go by so consequently uh ... what what she said Sandra Hi Kim said plus your question brings me to a history of Thomas\nOr is it going to hurt the Supreme Court I listen to the same\nThing twenty eight years ago and then I look at twenty eight years record of Thomas on the court and I've never seen any retribution on his part towards anything that was set against him at that time and he was mad when he said he was going through our high tech what\nNeeds to hike or something like ...\nYeah so so I you know after twenty eight years or less the same thing about Thomas not seeing it I think that I got great confidence that Kavanaugh's going to bring great prestige and knowledge\nAnd academic background and more importantly his work on the second highest court ...\nCourt and it's all positive\nNo it it's ... he's the one in the most qualified people period of time to sit on the court or Senator Grassley the uh the Susan Collins um situation in Maine\nYou own a small business

and independent jock eleven hundred ...\nGay Jim Jordan is with us now\nGradually it's never going to come on again I've got to switch to yourself I liked that he took me to task I Love that was really good one for the capsule I liked that congressman Jim Jordan also you wouldn't know it may be because he's always on some serious topic but he has a great sense of humor as well Congress worry that well I'm\nI'm I mean I I'm like you I Love Senator Grassley a and you know he's been on this whole Russian if the court the ... but that was funny [laughter]\nHe keeps it at one that's ... that's ... which I like when he was upset it's like one level it was like hey [laughter]\nI Love 'em he did a fantastic job and I thought I mean not backed by without about it now I I've always really liked it All right congressman what is going on now we had you had a Trump flying with all Rosenstein\nOr the other day down to where the heck when they fly to Florida yeah and I saw a rod at the White House at the cabinet thing and I said well yeah wrinkles and pick the dust on the president what'd you think he's probably your best friends what what what the theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I don't know the facts are facts and then you have to give it McCain memos that we subpoenaed there are all these stories out a earlier this week to talk about how serious they took the alleged comments Mr Rosenstein made about actually recording the presence in the oval office wearing a wire\nOr tape recording in whatever they were or a phone recording whatever they want to do um and the fact that it now looks like Mr Rogers by not going to show up tomorrow so we don't do that for sure if it were starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was supposed to uh tomorrow or in I'm In the Judiciary Committee so I may\nTrump flying with all Rosenstein or the other day down down where the heck when they find a Florida yeah and I saw rod at the White House at the cabinet thing and I said what yeah wrinkles and pick the dust on the president what'd you do you think some of your best friends what what what the theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I don't know the facts are facts and they've yet to give us McKay memos that we subpoenaed there are all these stories out a earlier this week that talk about how serious they took the alleged comments Mr Rosenstein made about actually recording the president in the oval office wearing a wire\nOr tape recording in whatever they were or a phone recording whatever they were going to do um and there's the fact that it now looks like Mr Rogers by not going to show up tomorrow so we don't do that for sure if it were starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was supposed to uh tomorrow or in I'm In the Judiciary Committee so\nI mean I think that because he has a good relationship with the president now he doesn't have to\n... well maybe maybe or maybe it has something to do with the stories that were written that said you know what you said this to a uh is that the stories that said he said there's been a tape and this page and then when I talk to Mr Baker so I'm book will ah\nWill hopefully he'll hopefully he'll take change his mind that will be there tomorrow so we can asking the questions that I think American people deserve to have the answers to\nCongressman joined explain James Baker the ah the man who is the attorney at the FBI and why his involvement in all of this and his contacts are so important to the narrative of how this whole Russian investigation was started\n'cause he's the chief counsel when you're the chief counsel the FBI and you're the guy in the middle of the two biggest investigations run by all these key players struck page and the Cape call me a\nThat is important and when it's now now being reported that uh he was he talked to both McCain and paid shortly after this meeting took place with Mr Rosenstein ... and that he understood it to be a serious comment made in that meeting that's why we need to talk to Mr Rosenstein and never forget the fundamental fast\nWhen have you ever seen this happen at any federal agency James Comey fire director former direct FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe light three times under oath fire Jim Baker chief counsel first demoted then left the FBI we used to page FBI council demoted than left and of course Peter ... on\nThe counter intelligence devoted than fired top people the FBI demoted or fired all the people who ran the Clinton investigation and then now as we know launched and ran the Russia investigation until Mr Rosenstein\nNamed Mr ... to take that investigation over [laughter] that's why this is important and that's why Mr Rosenstein needs to be in front of us so we can ask you questions about all that\nYeah he's not going to show there's no way I don't think I had mine for your either no no he's he's not going to he's not going to come I I just\nI I've I've got to say I don't understand why that he they claimed it was a joke and maybe I just don't have the sense of humor I really thought I had but I don't think that was all that funny like I'm going to wire myself or get wired go taped the president and then get the twenty Fifth Amendment going I don't understand why is that funny\nI agree with you I agree with you completely lawyer you shouldn't be joking about it about matters like that in front of the ordinance made\nThat is this is the guy who in effect is running the Justice Department and whether it's sarcasm or joke or what it should not be set\nUp particularly remember the time that this was done this was when the whole stinking town was all spun up this is between may ninth twenty Seventeen and may seventeenth twenty Seventeen may ninth as a date Rosenstein writes the memo that the president uses to fire Comey may seventeenth is when Rosenstein names\nAre lower as the special counsel sometime in between there and it looks like it happened on may sixteenth is one this alleged conversation took place so even joking about something in that timeframe when that whole city was all spun up about all the special counsel obstruction of justice and\nLike I'm gonna wire myself or get wired going taped to president and then get the twenty Fifth Amendment going I don't understand why is that funny\nI agree with you I agree with you completely Laura you shouldn't be joking about it about matters like that in front of the ordinance mean that is this is the guy who in effect is running the Justice Department and whether it's sarcasm or joke or what it should not be set\nUp particularly remember the time that this was done this was when the whole stinking town was all spun up this is between may ninth twenty Seventeen and may seventeenth twenty Seventeen may ninth as a date Rosenstein writes the memo that the president uses to fire calling me may seventeenth is when Rosenstein names\nAre lower as the special counsel sometime in between there and it looks like it happened on may sixteenth is one this alleged conversation took place so even joking about something in that timeframe when that whole city was all spun up about all the special counsel obstruction of justice and all those issues\nAt all the more reason why you should not be saying something even if it was a joke\nAgain the the main question that is on the table I think as a mother is going to do it while I was going to do but the main question on the table is why did you serve email an American citizen\nBased on information you received from and paid for from the opponent of Donald Trump ... now you can you can start surveilling someone because they traveled to Russia and\nSaid hello to a a government official at some point and years ago you he was questioned and the poor Carter Page mean where does he go to get you know his reputation back and where does he go to get here legal fees paid I mean he just twist into in for years\nNow I'm a ... it's good you brought that up because we sometimes it's important is to go back to the basics the Clinton campaign the DNC pay curtains carry offer who paid fusion GPS who hired a foreigner\nTo go talk to Russians and put together a document that was completely false totally bogus totally uncorroborated in that document became the basis we're going to a secret court to get a word to spy on Mr page because he was associated with the other parties can paint that is what happened here\nAnd ... and and they used the press to get all kinds of information flooding the FBI so so fusion GPS is a ... works for them she get the information to her husband's in front of it to the FBI so she gives information to resort top Justice Department official so you've got all these sources sending the lie\nTo the FBI which gives it more credibility always say the more people talking about the lie that either the law is to believe and that's exactly what took place you are but it's still a lie and they use that to go spy on the other campaign it's\nWhat you're going to the um what's your what's your sense about uh the mid term elections I mean do you think Kavanaugh the energy from that is going to sustain the Republicans to cut maybe some of the Democrat gain that there are still predicting in the house I'm well how do you see this playing out\nYeah I Hope so I Hope so I was I was in or out and about across our district and lived in Florida the other night when people were fired up to that our Senate how tough and a ... a good manager was being attacked by the left I think a lot of people are beginning to see that the leftist going completely crazy we did a tweak the other day I had more people come in and we said today's left\nA plot capital Nick destroy capital\nAnd that's today's left that they they embraced the radical you know ... when he disrespect the flag embrace Cuomo when he says\nAmerica was never that great cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed people who support the president or an old by the way it will destroy capital to prosecute I mean that's today's left and I think it is beginning to fire up conservative voters are Republican voters\nI Hope it is staying over the next twenty six days and that we can keep the majority now\nYou look over your shoulder more now with ah with what's happening out there\nI Hope so I Hope so that was I was in or out about across our district and lived in Florida the other night when people were fired up at that our Senate helpful in a ... a good manager was being attacked by the left I think a lot of people are beginning to see that the leftist going completely crazy we did a tweak the other day I had more people come in and we said today's left\nA plot capital Nick destroy capital\nAnd that's today's left that they they embraced of radical you know ... when he respects the flag embrace Cuomo when he says\nAmerica was never that great cheer on Maxine Waters when she just go out and harassed people who support the president\nOr an old by the way to destroy capital to prosecute I mean that today's left and I think it is beginning to fire up conservative voters are Republican voters\nHope it is staying over the next twenty six days and that we can keep the majority now\nDo you look over your shoulder more now with ah with what's happening out there\n[noise] yeah I mean I think you have to uh none of us are just as you are but like ... ... where we're at a back in June literally two days after Maxine Waters did her first ran we got what I what I called the treatment from a lady were\nOut and she started when a line of people get moving into the theater and um she just started\n... you know yelling shaming eagle and Jim Jordan terrible all this stuff so I mean it's ridiculous we we would never do that the people who are on the left but\nThey seem to want to do that all the time now so you do kind of just watch a little bit or you know um look I Wish they wouldn't do that I don't think it's appropriate let's just fight about and argue about the idea is let's not let's not make it personal let's not run people at restaurants and do all the things that they're\nThat they're going to do that they found to do it and it's safe yeah it's it's what they have now they're holding on to the anger by the way there was an interesting thing that I forgot to ask you earlier congressman\nAndy McCarthy the former I'm just a U.S attorney in southern district of New York he made this point on my show last night about Rosenstein and why the president may not end up are removing him as deputy AG let's listen\nI think president realizes that if he were to get rid of\nA Rosenstein at this point it would be like firing Comey times three and it would give more reason to extend the investigation why would he want to do that I mean it looks like now\nThere's not going to be any charges they're staffing downed they've transition to a lot of these cases that they brought to other components of the Justice Department this is about or\nWhat do you think about that yeah I mean I I it seems like things are pretty quiet some they must be writing the report Korea\nYeah I I Hope so and I think that that's probably a ... that can be right and uh obviously respect the McCarthy I'm In all the things she's written about always done so I look I don't think of any changes made the Justice Department until after the election until after ... hours that I think that that's obvious uh it's obvious that\nI'm the president wants to a new attorney general and um I think that that will happen at some point you but I don't think that's going to happen until after the election it until after the special counsel's work is finished\nHi this is Jim Clark C. you'll republic monetary exchange I said for years the secret to making money in the financial markets has to buy low and so high there is now an
