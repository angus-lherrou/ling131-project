to Steve\nIn North\nCarolina a lot of weight on the go to Robin Massachusetts first online five ... welcome\nHi Laura I'm first off can I say that ah at the end of my day\nWhen I sit down to watch your show that is the capstone of my day I really love watching you and and she knew an action and it's an honor to just be the right now so what I wanted to say is that you made a point on your angle the other night and I quite honestly don't think it's gotten enough attention\nAnd that's the idea that you said if I recall that Trump is teaching the Republicans how to fight and I absolutely think that that was a brilliant insight I mean it I think it's true or seeing the results of that all over the place right now\nI think Rob that came to me as I was watching Lindsey Graham during the confirmation battle when he he saw that Kavanaugh I think was getting a little too he was besieged and the questions and Kavanaugh was I think he was getting real hot okay\nI think Lindsey Graham decided you know something to heck with this I'm I'm going to take the floor and I'm going to reset this debate about the cabin are confirmation he did that I think it was after the president's press conference\nWhen the president came out an hour and a half and he was just fantastic and his support of Kavanaugh\nAnd with whether what what the reporters how we dealt with reporters he was having a good time but he said yeah I'm not doing this anymore I'm not I'm not playing defense anymore\nAnd the Republicans have got to stop playing defense Trump won by being on the off and he's not in perpetual apology mode because he said he sent a sharp tweet about someone he kept moving forward he didn't look back\nYou're not going to do well over mistakes we all need to do that and he looked forward keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump has taught us as a Republican and guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it he transforming this political party and it was in a moment too soon\nI really appreciate your comments Robin we have a great team on the anger mango we're going to take a break Kellyanne Conway up next\nHe sent a sharp tweet about someone he kept moving forward he didn't look back\nYou're not going to do well over mistakes we all need to do that any look forward keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump is taught us as Republican and guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it he transforming this political party and it was in a moment too soon\nI really appreciate your comments Rob we have a great team on the anger mango we're going to take a break Kellyanne Conway up next [noise]\nI I Chuck Grassley wasn't the perpetrator in whatever awful thing they've experienced in their lives and by\nThe way Laura America is watching er into left thought this would be a huge inflection point and they were absolutely right but not how they not how they expect you look at the polls\nThe Republicans and independents who lean Republican or ensues for the first time in a very long time about this election they're angry they're worried about the men and the boys in their life you have two sons I have a son they're just concerned that this could happen to anybody discreet new ad\nFor moms for Kavanaugh makes at that point exactly this could be your husband your brother your son\nYour cousin your co worker and people are concerned about that as well what about this new report that Leland income Kaiser\nWho Christine Blasey Ford said was at the party in question to corroborate her claims she said she felt pressure\nTo change her sworn statement by a former FBI agent she felt pressured because she said I Can't corroborate I Can't repeat it but I Can't corroborated I don't know like having all I was never had a party with Brett Kavanaugh as described by Ford and then those who are pretending this is about truth and justice in fact finding\nA pressuring her to change your story which is a fancy word of saying asking her to lie\nWell bumps or crime yes I'll correct\nAll a lot of that can be looked at after this who who leaked forwards identity will kind of emails were going back and forth wide Dianne Feinstein recommended these a democratic activist\nLawyers to Ford why they never told her she can testify in private and keep her ... her face in her name out of the press as much as she could she could just do it in California they go to them that's something that Senator Lindsey Graham told me right away he said she can do it by phone we can send somebody out there but\nNo no no they needed a clean slate and the cameras\nOn for them and I guess there next client base so it it's just an awful\nBut America has been watching and I don't the after he's confirmed and hopefully he will be I won't get ahead of the way certain senators are grappling with their vote decided to vote Lara but um if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as a justice of the United States Supreme court\nThis will not end there they think it won't end because this will be shouting it and then they've never met for things these men have never done to them personally and individually\nBut other folks won't forget how people behaved how they were harassed\nWhy Dianne Feinstein recommended ... a democratic activist\nLawyers to Ford why they never told her she can testify in private and keep her ... her face in her name out of the press as much as she could she could just do it in California they go to them that's something that Senator Lindsey Graham told me right away he said she can do it by phone

personally and individually\nBut other folks won't forget how people behaved how they were her raining folks drive drumming them out of restaurants publishing their their kids' names and their personal home addresses\nThat that's not that's not the first amendment that's just crazy that's completely crazy\nYou know do you think that in part I mean are are you argue this last week uh when the president came out of the press conference which I think was one of the best press conferences lot for your incredible I think you could have gone for three hours\nOr that he taught up\nA really needed lesson much needed lesson to Republicans on how to fight for what you believe in a fight for principle fight for a person instead of being back on your heels cowering in an elevator\nThat the the reason Trump got elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tour for either him sell for America and\nHe he's not they called him ... I think the bullies are the people who are swarming individuals in public or the Senate or restaurant in ... screaming at them within a centimeter of their skin but I think Trump to talk of the Republican bailout throughout this whole thing\nIn a large struck me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me uh that the way everybody describes Donald Trump President Trump is exactly that they're behaving and when I don't see from him he's\nFuming he's throwing things at the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they've become he's\nNot the way how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers in and bringing peace across the world and bring it make us prosper\nAt ... at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they own the acrimony they own the va to produce vicious wave via way they've gone after people um according to one gender according to one's politics and you're so right he doesn't retreat and back down when he believes in a principal\nOr a principal in this case PAL Brett Kavanaugh and they didn't know each other before this they didn't know each other well at all but the President Saleh judge Kavanaugh somebody who sat\nWho is sitting on the DC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred dishes judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more Lars they

women and specifically the uh this idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nYou must be heard and you must be believed and if you're not believe then you're anti warmer or you're anti victim\nAnd dumped upon us to talk about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop identifying ourselves as victims of this or victims of that because that's the that's not going to help you advance with the person as being a victim\nIt doesn't and that every every man as a perpetrator every man has to shoulder the burden of the me too movement every man is a rape is every man is a sexual harassed or by virtue of their gender and then every woman is a victim on even those who\nMany who are that had been victims of\nSexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall and that's being lost and it didn't here as well I mean if you if you asked if you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape on their mouths and the signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that I really had nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breed shirt anonymity they revealed her identity to the world they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even ... even the of telling her what her rights were what she could do and they're using Kavanaugh and\nHis shoulders should not be\nShould not be shouldering the entire me to live by the way large ding ding ding

just getting a crouch\nAnd let them keep doing it to us there won't be any us left because no good people will want to get into politics\nAnd I I really mean nothing not just someone from coming from someone who supported the president in the campaign but coming from a a lawyer and a longtime conservative like myself I really believe Trump sought the Republican how to fight\nI mean it's not going to simple formulation but for a long time Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they're all just like they were also like in an elevator on any longer I've never seen Mitch McConnell fight harder than he fought for this nomination\nThere well I think he's showing Trump is showing that this is what people have one at all along and look at this sometimes to the president I think goes way overboard and makes me cringe but if I got into my head if I have to pick\nI Want somebody who's going to fight than somebody who's not\nIf that means there's going to be access from time to time then you know then there's going to be accessed from time to time but I think he's showing that there is a hunger on our side to not just stand in a defensive crouch and keep taking this stuff with which we've been doing for years\nWell I think it's important that we have McConnell out their Lindsey Graham John Cornyn or even been fast talking about the mob mentality that we can't become a ... a country by mob rule where people are afraid to go to restaurants yep\n[noise] yeah and I and I think Laura that if you don't raise the stuff\nAnd turn it into an issue particularly one more on the cusp of an election\nYou don't have a compelling way after the election to say that you know this was on the table for people to consider and you have a mandate now to stop it because people have voted against it so I think this not only has to be fought but it has to be heat up\nA as an election issue and frankly it helps the Republicans to tea it up because I I've seen you say this was a you know on television and heard you on the radio said a million times ordinary people commonsense people do not like the stuff I mean they see these these uh Lenski I\nDirect action tactics and they say you know there are some parts of this agenda that I may agree with but these tactics are not America and and I don't think that's the America anybody wants who sensible\nAnd again people like sign

Seventy nine percent of a democratic women are saying that it's very important so the Republican women seem to have an edge here what are you hearing military\nI'm hearing a lot from our men and women as well and the women haired our state and there's also have been a couple of posed on here just recently that there was one that said there are sixty four percent of West Virginians that want Kavanaugh confirmed and then there's another one that says there's fifty three percent\nKevin ... is overwhelmingly for Kavanaugh\nAnd I've heard people say that the party of JFK has turned into Marlboro and that's exactly what's happened people are really livid over this and this is really about the Democrats trying to uh go back to the twenty sixteen election and try to cancel the election of Donald Trump and it's about roe versus Wade as well\nWorld military you also have Joe Manchin as your senator in West Virginia or what do you make of his coming out and voting for cloture which indicates but doesn't always mean that ah he might support the Kavanaugh's nomination\nWell let me just sum up senator Manchin like this if you like to play football you see somebody that that makes a taco well Joe Manchin doesn't have enough leadership on that courage to make the taco Joe mansion towels on after the taco\n... and that's just exactly the way he's doing this he string and everybody along\nOkay well we'll see how he votes but this is um do you ginger how would I Want to go to you you're the Republican National committee woman from Georgia\nI'm do are women in old seeing this as we heard Amy Schumer tried to frame this as we've heard so many Democratic senators or try to frame this as a vote for Kevin ... is a vote against women vote against women who've suffered some kind of abuse is that what you are people telling you\nQuite the opposite my people and not just is melody stated not just women that men to that mainly women I have had more women come up to me and say I was in the\nCarter the baby's toward the other day and the checkout lady was so upset about it women are saying that this is my concern is that we played the politics of gender and women against men and all in the evening and I'm\nA woman and I and I it's been a front can aid that we ... it it just makes me very angry that they are trying to play this game and the women that I'm Talking to see right through it\nKnow five or forty ... is the number I'm a ... and you know gender is not only women I think you learn a lot of talk so often about those men and women watching this I was I live in New Orleans\nQuite the opposite my people and not just is melody stated not just women that men to that mainly when I have had more women come up to me and say I was in the\nCarter that baby toward the other day and the checkout lady was so upset about it women are saying that this is my concern is that we played the politics of\nGender and women against men and all in the ... and I'm\nA woman and I and I it's in a front can age that we did it it just makes me very angry that they are trying to play this game and the women that I'm Talking to see right through it\nYou know eight five or forty lord is the number I'm a ... and you know ginger it's not only women\nI think you learn I just talked so often about those men and women watching this I was I live in New Orleans and I was in New Orleans the other day and they had the TV on at a lunch spot I go to and this is not you know hardly a democratic or Republican spot it's a New Orleans about everybody there\nAnd the conversation I overheard for mothers aunts sisters about ... and in many of them said look I I I don't I was against this guy's nomination but after watching the way he was treated\nI feel my gosh this could be my husband my son my my my nephew they see they've now it seems a ... and personalized the um attacks on on Kavanaugh and the\nThe the immorality of empty attacks that are just pounded in with no evidence Jody Smith give me your reaction to the you're the Indiana State director for the Susan B. Anthony Lewis what are you seeing\nAll week I can just absolutely agree with what everyone else has that wave knocked over four hundred thousand doors in Indiana\nAnd overwhelmingly we have support here for judge Kavanaugh I think what you said about people finally just getting sick to death we see a lot of people saying we were going to a vote Democrat but we're changing our vote we can't believe these tactics\nI think that um the uh the adage thing innocent before proven\nUm that you have to prove you're innocent says what has sparked people to be just outraged in America we believe in the bill of rights and the constitution and that means that you are innocent until proven guilty and now the opposite way\nAnd that's what's really sparked people to be angry and feeling as though this man has been utterly destroyed without any proof and its change their mind you\nKnow you you see a lot of that and and I think um the ... again I think the American people out there who are here beyond ideology beyond anything they're fair minded people\nAnd had these allegations panned out had a witness or corroborating evidence been produced they might have taken a very different view of it but the unrelenting salt on this guy in the face of no evidence at all\nI think done his outrage and let me tell you learned this the other day and we are in complete agreement I think\nWe may not be seeing the you're the woman this midterm election this could be the year of the man or the backlash demand where men come flooding the the voting booth because they think my gosh this is going to be meet tomorrow we're going to be right back copy very quickly just want to ask you that\nThe polls are tightening up between ... and a cinema\nIn I'm In Arizona you were there a forty five ... forty seven cinema ...\nTo the polls for ...\nHad a witness or corroborating evidence been produced they might have taken a very different view of it but the unrelenting assault on this guy in the face of no evidence at all I think that his outrage and let me tell you learn that this the other day and we are in complete agreement I think\nWe may not be seeing the year the woman this midterm election this could be the year of the man or the backlash\nOf demand where men come flooding the the voting booth because they think my gosh this is going to be meet tomorrow we're going to be right back happy very quickly just want to ask you that the polls are tightening up between ... and a cinema\nIn I'm In Arizona you're there a forty five ... forty seven cinema could this\nTo the polls for ...\nWell I I Hope so and it's all of that turn out if you look and hanging back haven't I haven't asked you got to get out there and hang out on that or I think Kelly can land so we all have to go to gather\nAll right we believe that their latest please stay with us we're going to take a quick break and we'll get to all your calls eight five five forty ... the ... show continues Raymond ... sitting in for the great lady of course incremental tonight ten pm eastern on the Fox news ... said\nThere was a guest a Orioles goals of the the code pink last night it was on the anger mangled I Want to play this exchange for you and get your reaction to listen\nI myself and the mother of two children my daughter is Fifteen and\nI mean so that you're ... you're worried about your daughter will not be able to what\nI worry that my daughter is getting a message from Congress said her experiences that her safety is not important\nBut is it about abortion so you're wearing your daughter or not going to get an so worried that my daughter and not have the right to control her okay forget it just I just wanted to or a town hall thank God I'm worried about\nYour reaction to that Jody Smith the of the Susan B. Anthony Lewis the Indiana State directed\nWell first and foremost I'm the mother of five children and three daughters and I certainly would be a lot more I'm also the mother of funds\nAnd I would be I'm very concerned about ah my daughter or son I'm telling the truth\nAnd making certain that they have the the right to express themselves we hold certainly no ill feelings towards um towards a Christine ... state but for it but at the same time we've got to know that the truth matters and an Indiana votes have consequences you know we have\nMy daughter will not have the right to control her okay okay I just I just want to know what we're talking about things that I'm worried about\nYour reaction to that Joe Smith the of the Susan B. Anthony Lewis the Indiana State directed\nWell first and foremost I'm the mother of five children and three daughters and I certainly would be a lot more I'm also the mother of funds\nAnd I would be I'm very concerned about ah my daughter or sons I'm telling the truth\nAnd making certain that they have the the right to express themselves we hold certainly no ill feelings towards um towards a ... state but for it but at the same time we've got to know that the truth matters and in Indiana votes have consequences\nYou know we have a very tight Senate race here as well\nAnd when people choose to initially say they're going to vote for somebody because they are qualified are not qualified and then\nEvery five minutes the parameters changes to what we're utilizing to determine our vote people remember that and one of the biggest things in Indiana that we're saying is\nMothers are concerned about their children that are going to be the next generation leaders ever being willing to run for anything I've talked to so many\nMillennials boys and girls are young men and young women that are saying I never want to put my family or myself in that position you know how in the world is judge Kavanaugh holding up underneath all of this especially for his own family\nSo it's really it's a fascinating to me that these women are making it about race when everybody involved in this particular incident as white\nEducated and and upper income so it's a doesn't make much sense to me that that's it's become about color it's become about\nUm women it really is as much about a judge Kavanaugh having the right to um have his innocence presumed it before and be proven guilty so that's\nAbout ... Indiana I think that's where a lot of voters and Americans come down there they they feel ... that they didn't have a real strong feeling about bread coming on the same way the president ... up until we can go to knew he was\nBut watching this play out watching that dramatic testimony seeing the accusations and the lack of evidence I think they come down to what you just mentioned\nIt seems a presumption of guilt and something else politics politics is overwhelming all of this this is ideological blood sport\nAnd a man's reputation whose family be damned we're going to take this nomination don't becomes the marching orders no matter what adult calls\nI think the American people now are about to have a referendum on that idea that you can take down a political opponent at any calls with no evidence and shame destroy use reputation for all time in public\nEven force of a of a woman who's going through some sort of distress into the open to be used as your political weapon that I think you use the Americans look at that and go man this concerns me\nJunior I Want to ask you um you you have the big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia between choosy Abramson and Brian Kemp he's up the Republican brand company two points\nDo you believe female conservatives are going to rally there in that governors\nYes I did and I think this Kavanaugh hearing it's going to really play into that because it's making when I was really upset that people are playing that the\nGoing through some sort of distress into the open to be used as your political weapon that I think is is the Americans look at that and go man this concerns me\nGinger I Want to ask you um you you have a a big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia between sushi Abramson and Brian Kemp he's up the Republican Brian Kemp with two points\nDo you believe female conservatives are going to rally there in that Governor ...\nYes I did and I think this Kavanaugh hearings going to really play into that because it's making when\nI was really upset that people are playing that the women against man card and I'm Stacey Abrams is a woman but Brian count is at a conservative man who stands for our conservative principles personal responsibility limited government and lower taxes all the things that we\nAre that's our party is all about so I really do think and I had thing just in the last week or so across this date\nPeople are more motivated than ever now to get out get out and that and not only that but volunteer\nThat I was at the camp campaigning either gay people were coming in to get yard signs and the topic of the conversation was exactly what we're talking about the Kavanaugh hearings and how we said this politics they implied out and they'll they they are really playing dirty the leftist playing dirty and\n... people don't want to see this they really are discouraged\nYeah no I I you know as I look out and watches it it does have all the markings of the last presidential election where we saw a lot of drama for the cameras celebrities coming out now we've had walkouts in protests and signs and confrontations with senators and these dramatic moments\nAt the same time in coffee shops in factories yeah in the school on to pick up the kids if you listen closely you're hearing something very different this same dynamic I think is we're propelled Trump into office and it was that kind of well he called it the silent majority\nI'm my sense is just working Americans and Americans would not by nature political activists they don't get out in March there working there working they privately held their views about politics that they spread over the dinner table or to their families and occasionally to their friends but\nIt's not something you go to war over and today in Washington I have to tell you I've seen friendship shattered people simply drew don't talk to each other\nAnd it's all about politics it's because they they disagree politically and it's become an ugly violent thing where once it was a dialogue to try to convince the other person to your point of view today it's slash smashing destroy\nAnd I don't think Americans but particularly women really want that now their core group I think who do and we've seen them in the street\nBut moms wives working women I I I don't think it's where they live I'm going to give a quick round Robin we are going to go through everybody again a starting with military Potter of from the Virginia Republican Party in West Virginia are your thoughts on where we might be headed here in these midterms\n[laughter] I think that are due to the situation with this nomination of a\nA very very qualified a judge the Supreme Court I think that the Republicans are energized to get out and vote for Republicans conservative Republicans that will support President Trump's agenda\nAnd I think the Democrats were also get out and vote the right way to for cable because West Virginia's counties there's fifty five of them\nAt all fifty five went for Trump and the election\nWho do and we've seen them in the street but moms wives\nWorking women ... I I don't think it's where they live I'm going to give a quick round Robin we're going to go through everybody again a starting with military Potter of from the Virginia Republican Party in West Virginia of your thoughts on we're we might be headed here in these midterms\n[noise] I think that uh due to the situation with this nomination of a\nA very very qualified a judge the Supreme Court I think that the Republicans are energized to get out and vote for Republicans conservative Republicans that will support President Trump's agenda\nAnd I think the Democrats were also get out and vote the right way to for people because West Virginia's counties there's fifty five of them\nAnd all fifty five went for Trump in the election\nSo that meant and twenty sixteen so that means that we'd had Democrat votes as well\nAnd I believe that the Democrats also are a we're going to get out and vote for Republicans this time so I think that everything's looking good and we love our country and we want to protect our country so and I'm going to spend every last minute I can uh if it's my last breath\nTrying to stand up for what's right for our country\nOkay well I don't want you to do that for military we now we need you in December so there may\nBe my last breath I'm so busy [laughter]\nWell you keep going great to talk to you know junior high powered last where do you um you're you're the you're in Georgia in the Republican Party in Georgia or given ... years and we're seeing given the cabin all fight in the in the way it's being processed by voters what impact will end up in the mid ...\nI ... I think it is energizing new voters more and I also think that people that were kind of neutral and on the fence that were energized about net terms because a lot of times people don't get excited about the midterms I think we're going to see where you've heard a lot about the blue wave I Believe the red light is going to come and people are\nSick and tired of being bullied around and they're going to stand up for their freedom and we love our country we care about our country and those people are going to come out of the woodwork and I think it's going to be a ... not just going to be a way it's going to be a ... and people are going to be shot shock and awe is what I predict\n... a Judy Smith I'm I'm going to end with you you know Republicans were really bad at telling their story I always critique them to this they they can't tell a story to save their lives\nIn this instance ... Democrats gave them a dramatic story that ended up breaking their way how old is play the drama the intimacy and the projection I think many voters are are are engaged in as a project themselves on the cabinet and his family and what they've been through\nWhile I agree with what on the other gal says said in Indiana we love our country we were first on the board for Trump remember that Mike Pence's as loved in Indiana and we are here to say that we support\nU.S Supreme court justices supports the constitution of the United states living breathing document and for that reason because we are so strong we also will support a senator", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cave Creek", "day": "05"}
