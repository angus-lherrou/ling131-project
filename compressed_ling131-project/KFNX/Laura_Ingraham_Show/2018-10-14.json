Holt markets crash it's ugly the people in in power get blamed the gear teams come out\nAnd it's just not a good time for the body so they constantly are giving the stance that have no real basis in reality\nAnd you say well but you know if that's what kind of keeps this whole thing going you know why do I care\nWell the reason that you should care\nIs because it allows people if they believe the numbers and not just allows them actually kind of direct them to making bad decisions so for example last friday we had the jobless numbers come out and people talked about how well you know yeah we didn't create as many jobs as we expected\nBut when you look at the raw provisions for the month before it was still okay and now we have the lowest unemployment rate we've had in this country for fifty years back to Nineteen sixty nine or whatever it was\nWell the thing is that true okay and we're going to get into why it's not true but what it means is that when people hear that and they think holy cow the economy is firing on all cylinders therefore\nI'm going to put more money at risk and\nThat's what kind of keeps this whole thing going you know why do I care\nWell the reason that you should care\nIs because it allows people if they believe the numbers and not just allows them actually kind of direct them to making bad decisions\nSo for example last friday we had the jobless numbers come out and people talks about how well you know yeah we didn't create as many jobs as we expected but when you look at the raw provisions for the month before it was still okay and now we have the lowest unemployment rate we've had in this country for fifty years\nBack to Nineteen sixty nine or whatever it was\nWell the thing is that true okay and we're going to get into why it's not true but what it means is that when people hear that and they think holy cow the economy is firing on all cylinders therefore I'm going to put more money at risk and the stock market\nThey're buying in it the wrong time the key to making money at anything in life as buying low and selling hot\nBuying stocks at the all time high of the market is unlikely to yield the returns that people are expecting\nAnd that's the thing stocks are incredibly expensive right now it doesn't matter what metric you want to look at stocks are basically they've been may be more expensive once or twice in all of us history\nSo you say well why would I buy them now\nWill people buy them now because they have this misperception that the economy is doing well and everyone you hear\nWe will stipulate that number as it were okay well if you then look at how much that the world has it's generally somewhere around I think three to three and a half times that number so whatever it is it's three and a half times more is what the total debt is so it's in the three hundred kind of trillion dollar range three to three fifty so\nYou'd sit there and say okay you have all this debt out there what's going to keep this thing growing your people stop borrowing money and they start paying back the money they do well in fact nothing okay because the only reason there's been anything that looks like growth pretty much anywhere is the fact that people are borrowing huge sums of money\nI mean the United states last year\nFor actually for the last couple of decades\nFor us to be able to grow the economy a dollar we have to borrow about three dollars so again as long as there is confidence and people are willing to borrow and people are willing to lend we can continue to get something that kind of looks like gross\nBut besides the feds issues which I'm going to get into it's why I'm so concerned about the election this fall again not a political statement you can think Trump is the devil and you can think he's got on earth it makes no difference to me okay I Do not have a dog in that fight\nBut if the Democrats take the house and I don't know that they will or will ...\nBack the money they do well in fact nothing okay because the only reason there's been anything that looks like growth pretty much anywhere is the fact that people are borrowing huge sums of money I mean the United states last year for actually for the last couple of decades\nFor us to be able to grow the economy a dollar we have to borrow about three dollars so again as long as there is confidence and people are willing to borrow and people are willing to lend we can continue to get something that kind of looks like gross\nBut besides the feds issues which I'm going to get into it's why I'm so concerned about the election this fall again not a political statement you can think Trump is the devil and you can think he's got on earth it makes no difference to me okay I Do not have a dog in that fight\nBut if the Democrats take the house and I don't know that they will or will not and again I don't have a dog in the fight one way or another\nI'm going to tell you that is not going to be good for market confidence because if you think the last couple of weeks with Brett Kavanaugh were kind of vicious\nWeighty what happens when when ... when Donald Trump is center stage okay because I I don't know I Would guess that if you went back thirty six years into Trump's lawyer [laughter] you might find something slightly unsavory um that or at least that you can ... truth that way\nAnd and again you may think that all that stuff should come out and you may think it should all be forgotten in the pat and you may have blind faith that he's telling the truth and blind faith that no matter what he does he's a liar\nAgain it makes no difference\nIs it going to be good for the country's confidence confidence in our economy has confidence in our market if it is two years of sheer division well every piece of this man's life it's investigated and not just his life\nEvery person who knows Brett Kavanaugh's probably not out of the woods yet and again you may think this is all great and what should happen in this divine justice that's all fine but understand it's going to have a tremendous impact on business\nAnd to be Frank if I'm the party out of power I'm not sure I'm Upset by that because if you crash this economy you will romp in the next election you will take every lover of power that's out there now again I Am not attributing that as a motive to anybody do not much to understand\nBut they've had worse things happen to them\nAnd you know don't throw me into that briar patch as it were so I look at this and say what is it a kind of road confidence one of them is money getting more expensive\nToo is obviously the market starting to go down housing that's been slowing and many of the larger cities I was actually we had a student and the other day it's been a mortgage broker for going on Thirty years\nAnd his statements ... flat out was the recession is already started he said I've been through this movie before\nHe says there's two big brokers\nNationally that he mentioned don't remember the names offhand but both of them I was laid off you know around two hundred people like one of them last friday laid off a hundred and eighty people the other one was like two hundred and fifty and he said these are the things that you see happening when housing is basically grinding to a halt\nNow can they do things can they go to lunch money down to the keep this thing go and maybe for a little while sure but at some point we know this all has to stop\nAnd when it stops it's going to be really really ugly and again if I'm the party out of power or even the party in power and I'm not in love with the policies that this president\nIt'd be really nice to be able to blame all this stuff on him when it went south\nAnd and as I've often said\nWe give way too much credit to presidents for things when they look like they're going well we give way too much blame when things aren't going well because at the end that day the president can only do so much now\nLaid off you know around two hundred people like one of them last friday laid off a hundred and eighty people the\nOther one was like two hundred and fifty and he said these are the things that you see happening when housing is basically grinding to a halt\nNow can they do things can they go to lunch money down to the keep this thing go and maybe for a little while sure but at some point we know this all has to stop\nAnd when it stops it's going to be really really ugly and again if I'm the party out of power or even the party in power and I'm not in love with the policies that this president\nIt'd be really nice to be able to blame all this stuff on him when it went south\nAnd and as I've often said\nWe give way too much credit to presidents for things when they look like they're going well we give way too much blame when things aren't going well because at the end that day the president can only do so much\nNow but it doesn't matter it's all the perception and so if we can hang a whole bunch of stuff on you know where the ever the other party is in power then that's going to be good for us so when I look at that\nI see a couple of different scenarios I mean most people believe that the Republicans will hold the Senate again maybe they will maybe they won't I have no real insight into this but I actually read some analysis today that kind of was here's the forest scenarios of what could happen\nAnd one of the scenarios was Democrats take the house don't take the Senate\nAnd it was well you know Trump just stopped ... a lot of his way and you know whatever we kinda muddle through auto no no no I don't think that's one of the choices again I think it's two years of investigation I think it is two years of division\nThe likes of which we haven't seen and again people can blame either side that's not the point\nBut are you prepared for that financially are you prepared for that if all of a sudden there's a recession how safe is your job\nOkay we always think about well this is what I'm doing the market goes down and and I had a guy in the last class had a fair amount of money and you know what's your strategy when the market goes down because none of it's protected right now and the strategy was well outsell\nWas the question is at what point how much are you willing to lose before yourself\nAnd then to who because everyone had to ... to sell right so we need to have a better strategy from the for them that\nSo again in the class what I'm trying to teach you guys is here's how you can be prepared here's the signs look for that the markets in trouble then it's here's how you're not just survive it how do you actually make money when it goes down and\nHow do you continue to make money if it keeps going up because we can do that to have you want to come up to

them out of it [laughter] okay that'd be a big there'd be bridge players will be for no Trump will be on their science for for my red flares up there\nSo at any rate ... it's going to be chaos okay it's going to be division you think again the Kavanaugh stuff was bad\nThis will be a whole 'nother level okay now again you may think that's great you may think Trump's evil all the rest of it not my argument my argument is is that is not going to be good for the economy and it's not going to be good for the market because the confidence will be lost\nThe other thing playing into that is the fact that interest rates are going up\nIn a market that's built on that and it's built on cheap money and built on bringing in demand from the future to today it Monday becomes more expensive that becomes a lot less lucrative for people to do I mean if you can borrow money one or two percent and you're a big us company\nAnd you can buy back your own stock and in management makes themselves rich by doing this the board make some money 'cause they owned company stock everybody keeps their jobs everybody's happy it's fantastic I mean in just to kind of take a step back on that\nThis year companies will buy back more of their stock that any time in us history okay the estimate is this year they're going to buy back about one point two trillion dollars in stock\nNow that helps the stock market for many reasons one is it reduces the number of outstanding shares\nAnd the market ... stock price has moved based on supply and demand\nAnd one of the things they're doing is they're taking away supply\nAnd if people have to invest in the stock market because they can't get decent rate anywhere else when you reduce the supply if you had the same amount of demand what would happen to price will price would go up well but you have more demand because people are so far far behind where they need to be for retirement\nThat they're staying in the market and taking more and more risk\nAnd later in life when they have less and less time to recover because what's the role\nThis year companies will buy back more of their stock that any time in us history okay the estimate is issues are going to buy back up at one point two trillion dollars in stock\nNow that helps the stock market for many reasons one is it reduces the number of outstanding shares\nAnd the market ... stock price has moved based on supply and demand\nAnd one of the things they're doing is they're taking away supply\nAnd if people have to invest in the stock market because they can't get decent rate anywhere else when you reduce the supply if you had the same amount of demand what would happen to price will price would go up well but you have more demand because people are so far far behind where they need to be for retirement\nThat they're staying in the market and taking more and more risk\nAnd later in life when they have less and less time to recover because what's the alternative again go buy bonds\nGo by an annuity and pay eight and a half percent commissions and then get a lousy really return and tie up your money when you can't get it out with massive penalties for years is that really the answer and and and for most people the answer's no okay I mean ten years ago\nWe had a million bucks you could buy a Thirty Years' CD page five percent yet fifty grand a year he had some Social Security\n... you're not living the life that you're doing OK\nOkay today you go my thirty or CD I mean a lot of places you're looking at one and a quarter percent\nSo you know your your million bucks gives you a twelve thousand five hundred dollars a year your Social Security is given you last year the average person actually this year average person got an increase in Social Security of twenty eight bucks a month I'm In February and special get a whole dollar a month right\nBut it was a lot better than the year before we got four bucks a year before that when you get anything\nSo people are sitting here going on so far behind where I Need to be the stock market's been doing great I'm going to buy in and then they hear that the economy's doing well and the here that earnings are up and they hear the unemployment down and they say this is safe\nIt isn't safe and it isn't safe because the key to the market is buying cheap and so when it's expensive and the market right now is ridiculously expensive again on almost any metric I've ever seen\nHistorically this is the second or third most expensive market in history and drew for you to justify those prices you have to believe we are on the verge of some great renaissance and I don't see it\nYou got a third of the country not working and again how do you have three point seven percent unemployment when Ninety five million people aren't even looking for work okay how can that possibly be\nWell it's because of how we do to stand in the way we do the stats doesn't make any sense as long as someone does it look for work they're not unemployed\nOkay so if no one in this country had a job and nobody was looking for work the unemployment rate would be zero it would be Nirvana okay except that we would all be broke\nThis is unfortunately again a part of my whole point on\nIf you don't understand the fundamentals of how these numbers are done or even like the inflation numbers inflation numbers are totally insane\nGave me the calculated inflation they assume that every person the United states wants their house okay\nAnd then they assume that they basically and they make it up okay well we think this house would rent for this much and that's how much we're going to charge you for it I mean seriously that's how they do this and it's like forty percent of of the CPI the consumer price index is tied to housing costs as which are totally made up\nOh and by the way and when you hear these unemployment numbers of people argue about what was it a hundred and fifty thousand or a hundred and fifty five thousand or two hundred thousand or two hundred and five thousand jobs ... one of those numbers come from\nA lot of our estimates okay one of the things they do is they say well we don't know how many new businesses started this month so we can't contact them to find out how many people they have\nPoint on if you don't understand the fundamentals of how these numbers are done or even like the inflation numbers inflation numbers are totally insane\nGave me the calculated inflation they assume that every person the United states wants their house okay\nAnd then they assume that they basically they make it up okay well we think this house would rent for this much and that's how much we're going to charge you for it I mean seriously that's how they do this and it's like forty percent of of the CPI the consumer price index is tied to housing costs as which are totally made up\nOh and by the way and when he hit his unemployment numbers of people argue about what was it a hundred and fifty thousand or a hundred and fifty five thousand or two hundred thousand or two hundred and five thousand jobs get one of those numbers come from\nA lot of our estimates okay one of the things they do is they say well we don't know how many new businesses started this month so we can't contact them to find out how many people they have so let's just say let's say there were ten thousand new businesses ... that's what we do\nOkay we just make up how many businesses we think just started up this month and how many people they employed\nAnd then we'll sit and argue about it in a country of three hundred and twenty million people we argue about whether this five thousand or ten thousand fewer more jobs and this is the insanity leading people to make bad decisions in their own portfolios and making bad decisions in Washington\nThe Federal Reserve has screw this up big time and they've got a difficult job because they\nScrewed up so big okay but now what they're doing is not just raising rates if\nThe quantitative tightening that is where the real danger to the market comes to the end of the kind of known knowns there's among an unknown unknowns out there that could hurt this market but that's the biggest no no and again we're closer to the end of this in the beginning to come back to that thought but for those if you're just joining us\nIn a class I'm going to be teaching on this is before the crash profit and protection strategies for any market the idea is\nThat if you think about how does Goldman Sachs how to Warren Buffett how did these people really make money in the market\nThey buy loans so high they don't buy stuff and hold onto it forever they don't buy stuff in hope it goes up they buy stuff and they make it go up so you think about Warren Buffett\nThe first quarter of this year he bought Seventy five million shares of apple now did you buy 'em all at once no he's got the money to do it as a hundred billion dollars he doesn't know what to do with it but didn't buy 'em all in one day why\nBecause Warren Buffett pays attention to price Warren Buffet bought those years that I can tell for\nA hundred and fifty to a hundred and fifty five dollars a share now after we bought him he told you that he bought him why did he tell you that\nBecause he knows that you'll look at and go well Warren Buffett's a smart guy if you buy an apple I want to buy apple and he told you what it was about a hundred and sixty five and from there to stock went almost straight up to two hundred and twenty five he's up fifty percent in his apple trade already okay\nBecause the retail trade or doesn't pay attention to price they hear apple they hear Warren Buffett and they think good investment\nBut it's a good investment if you get in it the right price tuned class what I'm going to show you is how do you identify the places where people like Warren Buffett are buying and selling and if you could do the same thing they were doing at the same prices that's a useful piece of information and then it how do we manage our risk when we're wrong\nSo if you want to come out and get to free tickets to be one of the next dozen callers at eight for for eight eight seven

getting these really high electric bills and heart goes from a PS and that sort of peace because atheists mentor people had some news or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake ... let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nUm I use the analogy there's lots of people out there that can make hamburgers okay but I'm up at these things but there's only one that has a secret sauce now\nSecret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management let me talk about that we see on our bills this thing called demand and a lot of people in a piece of this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe Thirteen point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power from last

sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management and let me talk about that we see on our built this thing called demanded a lot of people in a PS this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called the man and it's a number of like maybe ... team point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three ten\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah\nIt is the hardest time of the day between three and eight PM and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this is because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\n... there's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it so the smart energy management the way that the analogy that people like like that I've been told\nIs remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance\nMonday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were known more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist no matter when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when it's hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan is to me and I do get wound up above this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay young ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is we\nKnow we have to pay for a lot of us don't under\n... forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have an auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay for a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own\nAt between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt you're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you anymore so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's going to continue to go off\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them\nAnd I explain all this to them so not only are you paying between seven and half of neat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying two words the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your homes Carol and that's the two things I tell people there is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um it it just it doesn't make sense for them\nThey can Ukrainian rates everybody should just call you just to find out how to read their bill and then I don't know how to read their ... and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if he goes why didn't I Do the sooner I write so many people will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site ... I Do a rate I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half\nAnd today there is out there\nThey are never going to stop where they're at\nUm ... it just it doesn't make sense for them they built in Ukrainian rates everybody should just call you just to find out how to read\nTheir bill and then I don't know how to read their ... and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if you go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people who will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site and I do a rate I'm review and break it down\nIt's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half an hour and we'll send it out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go oh now I understand what she writes\nAnd so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car\nAnd gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty well\nYou're going to go over here and pay two fifty and that's essentially Carol\nI'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS Messer piece rate punch today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home we use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid to the power company cuts that in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money well\nHere's what we're going to do we want to give out your phone number because everyone\nReally should just give her call she has a free consultation she's ready to what the better Business Bureau I just found out at that out and uh her phone number direct it is six to three\nEight five zero eight two two nine she wants you to go up on her website it is ask solar Sandy dot com go to ask make sure it's ... dot com\nFill out the kilowatt worksheet and she can help you save money on a bill that you're already paying way too much money on what are your final words for today you know\nIt it's the simplest is you know I really am on a mission when I helped my daughter it was the first time in a long time and do some my circumstances that I was able to do\nSomething really significant in her life because I financially it wasn't able to help her but I saw the really big problem for her and it gave me\nA self accomplishment in it she was so ever so grateful than she shared it with her neighbors and a lot of her neighbors did it because the ...

fans and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit\nOr the promise is to you and to your children and two oh who are far off as many as the lord our God will call\nThis demonstrates remarkable consistency with everything that we have seen thus far in Romans chapter five some twenty two different yet cooperative redemptive elements had been noted so far\nEach of them not only fits the lead element in Romans by one that we are justified by faith they all fit each other\nThis reinforces the biblical premise that we had been examining\nIt means that fate repentance baptism grace holiness

mission since I met you tell everybody why you're here so much\nWhy am I hearing so much because everybody has to fill everybody has the power bill that we all\nWe are all very frustrated especially this summer I'm seeing so many people that have called me listening to our show Carol\nI'm and I'm On different radio shows as well and my whole mission is because of my daughter\nFive years ago [noise] um that I wasn't able to help my own daughter pay her power bill due to an accident and then I had many years ago I myself was on a fixed income Social Security disability and when she reached out to me and said mom I really need help with my ...\nI said well honey I really can't help you that much with your ... but by the way how much does it\nAnd when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident and I said ... you have a little tiny house\nWhy am I here so much 'cause everybody has a lot ... everybody has the power bill that we all\nWe are all very frustrated especially this summer I'm seeing so many people that have called me listening to our show Carol I'm and I'm On different radio shows as well and my whole mission is because of my daughter\nFive years ago [noise] um that I wasn't able to help my own daughter pay her power bill due to an accident and then I had many years ago I myself was on a

much does it\nAnd when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident and I said ... you have a little tiny house how is your purview however bilby so high\nI said there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and heart goes from a PS ... he says a P estimates are people had some news or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake ... let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nUm I use the analogy there's lots of people out there that can make hamburgers and K they come up with these things but there's only one that has a secret sauce now\nSecret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management and let me talk about that we see on our built this thing called demand and a lot of people an atheist this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe Thirteen point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hottest I'm of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest time of day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before\nMe being Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hardest time of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies in a monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest some of the day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\nThere's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it so the smart energy management the way to the analogy that people like like that I've been told\nIs remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance Monday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were known more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends\nThey could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist no matter when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when it's hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal\nUm I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay for a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own\nAt between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt you're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got\nFound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal\nUm I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay for a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS and asked her if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you anymore so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's going to continue to go up\nAnd now I've walked in my own power rate from my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them\nAnd I explain all this to them so not only are you paying between seven and half and eat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying two words the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd years living comfortably in your homes Carol and that's the two things I tell people\nThere's not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones put more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus electric companies\nAnd live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last complications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um it it just it doesn't make sense for them\nThey go in Ukrainian rates everybody should just call you just find out how to read their bill and then I don't know how to read their ... and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if he goes why didn't I Do the sooner I write so many people who will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site ... I Do a rate I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nIf there's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half\nAnd today there is out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to clear it's all the time and then they go home now I understand what she rang and so no judgments but at the end of the day we\nHave an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simply this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon\nI Do a rate I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half and today there is

day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car\nAnd gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here in the heat you fifty and that's essentially Carol\nI'm sending people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS Messer piece rate puns today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home will use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth
