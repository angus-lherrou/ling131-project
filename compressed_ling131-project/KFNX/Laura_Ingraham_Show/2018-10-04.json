it's\nIt's really almost like a like a drug addict addicted to the drug they're addicted to the pursuit of power so they'll do literally anything to get there and what's happened in this capital earring is literally\nFrom what I you know for I'm I'm fifty three years old and from what I can see this is literally one of the most important periods of time to witness you know that they it's their own destruction they did it to themselves but everybody else can now see I've got plenty a Democrat from that or\nIt's just common sense you take a look at what what's been going on and everything they're loving it this guy and they're really taking themselves down they did it for themselves and it's very very obvious\nYeah that was the uh that was the opening show last night now if there's any doubt in anyone's mind just how out of control the Democrat Party is how they want to so chaos where we should have calm where they want to rebel route\nAnd intimidate instead of show

and yourself [noise]\nAh great so what do you what do you make of now the Democrats all we the and upset about this uh the state of this a supplemental background investigation\nWell first of all the the original background investigation was at a public document data so why should the follow up investigation be a public document what I'm going to be very interested in St Louis how long it takes a for that information to leak\nOut of the skiff that's where they have to go to look at it and uh who's gonna who's gonna lab that it's going to be ridiculous but it will come out sooner or later during the\n... what a skiff is I Know what it is that my\n... well basically the skip is is a room that's a soundproof\nOr you can't hear you can hear in as you walk in there you can't carry in the cell phone ... watch or anything like that you can sit there and read it it's like a lead enclosed room so nothing kind of traits that\nThey're considering they're read the recent report not make a copy of it I don't know if they're going to allow him to make notes I don't know how they're going to stop that and\nUm and then they can leave it for the next person to review but this is it's just a matter of time before something like that leaks out\nBottom line is how many interviews do you have to do are\nAs many it takes the delay this past the election that's what\nIt looks like they're out of cards so the current mayor coming down on this don't you don't you get that sense there's no there's no more delays are going to vote on this this weekend\nI think they should they should not be any more delays you do the best you can do in the bottom line is the only thing that the that the Democratic side of the house really wants to hear is how many more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative\nTo to allegedly offer ... and only to the way of looking at a a vote I think this is a ... it's going to be voted on I Believe by the end of the week\nUm the complaint is that they did not looking to judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college and law school or high school that that wasn't adequately\nAs many as it takes the delay

a it's going to be voted on I Believe by the end of the week\nThe um the complaint is that they did not\nLooking to judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college and law school or high school that that wasn't adequately investigate it and the supplemental what was your response to that bear\nHow do they know that if they haven't read it how do they know what's in the supplemental\nYou know they they don't know what questions are asked to who was interviewed they might very well have interviewed a couple of guys that the the judge has some beers with or who said yeah I had beers with them and nothing ever happened to you know they don't know that they just surprising that they just want to keep the pot stir it up\nIn order to the you know continue that the alleged doubt a contrived out I look at it as but those that are opposed to the ... we have an update\nOn here that Bill Bill a question for you Ronan Farrow in the New Yorkers are reporting that ah the FBI prove ignored testimony from former classmates of Kevin ... these are people that went to Yale with him and are they the the ... they're trying to\nRonan Farrow claims that these are primary eyewitnesses are witnesses to the Deborah Ramirez allegations the problem is that you read and to the store you realize these are all here say witnesses who claim somebody told them that if somebody told them that this happened\nSo it would the FBI proved those people are they just seem to not credible witness it\n... probably not credible witnesses and bottom line first of all it's coming from Ronan\nA secondly I'm a these if they're if they're not ... witnesses to that they not permitted on the stand and a quarter law never mind are doing this and it you have to make that cut off someplace into what is ... you know comment what does make sense to do\nAnd none of these people make sense than anybody can come up with some sort of a story I heard from a friend a friend that doesn't that doesn't carry any weight with anybody mhm\nWell again people think that the FBI is conducting some global investigation into any allegation no matter how remote\nAnd interviewing people on a hearsay basis where people have just hearsay recollection of things that happened Thirty years ago it make sense\nIt makes no sense Laura and that's not happening I think the problem that exists here uh the bureau is going to get sucked on the one way or the other if it comes out the way it appears it's going to come out in the ... the the democratic side of the houses are going to say they're all from Trump bands from the bureau\nIf it if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and ... and it's credible uh then you know the beer is going to take a black guy from the other side of it I was I just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that um was demanded and done and let's get the vote\nI think again in the end people want to have people\nFaith in our in our institutions of government especially like the FBI and you you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting in a political manner ever\nSo far and that's not happening I think the problem that exists here of the barrel is going to get sucked on the one way or the other if it comes out the way it appears it's going to come out in the ... the the democratic side of the houses are going to say they're all from ... from the bureau\nIf it if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and ... and it's credible uh then you know the bureau's got to take a black guy from the other side of that was I I just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that um was demanded\nAnd done and let's get the vote\nI think again in the end people want to have people want to\nFaith in our in our institutions of government especially like the FBI and\nYou you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting in a political manner ever and I think that the media do an enormous disservice went on an issue like this with no you know with with no corroborating contemporary contemporaneous witnesses\nTo expect field agents or the FBI to be doing these types of you know broad ranging ... is this kind of broad ranging slew thing into the background of some and this is not what the what the FBI does and people don't\nGet that or the media has been so remiss\nIn not reporting properly what they're all the FBI us\nBut if you if you see the ignorance it's a willful ignorance of the media and then the the poor people who don't know any better or who don't have time to delve into these issues like wait why are they keeping the secret outrageous this shouldn't be secret this is our Supreme Court you know that's going to happen\nOf course it's going to happen we write is a combination of everything that you should or bottom line is the some of these people\nTruly don't believe um that there's anything going on that's wrong here it's because of who they support they have to say well I Believe that uh\nThe the judge Kevin I was guilty that you can't look at the facts and come out with that conclusion but they do but ...\nYou're on the lower

sensible were as you suggest you do they say well look we saw this testimony\nWe believed Ford and we believed Kavanaugh also\nAnd so what really makes the difference well does the FBI find cooperation are not well what we find in the polling is that sixty percent said well look there's no cooperation and in fact\nThe nomination should be confirmed and that included eighty six percent of Republicans Democrats or do you\nLook Democrats even after there's no ... sixty percent of Democrats [noise] you know would oppose the nomination but you see that sort of the center\nOf the country says hey if I could see that there is no cooperation I'm going to be fair here I'm not going to ruin a this guy's life on the basis of two people who testified who I think are fair if there's no

there is no cooperation I'm going to be fair here I'm not going to ruin a this guy's life on the basis of two people who testified who I think are fair if there's no collaboration and that's certified

um who took\nWhite women to task after the Trump election who helped him get elected providing him with fifty two percent of their support\nSay faith focused her remarks on college educated white women forty four percent whom of whom voted for Trump saying chastising them for wanting to go back to watching HGTV and forget about the election you can't look away she said\nWell now a it looks like some women are taking that to heart a morning console political poll found that President Trump net support among Republican women had dropped by Nineteen points\nWell that's a huge drop if that's if that translates into people voting for the Democrat Party that could be a disaster for the ...\nWell I think that is the the biggest\nBut both changing the electorate concern for the Republicans and and victory points for the Democrat so far which is that the cost of what I Would say the closet conservatives in the country are actually independent suburban women\nWho voted twenty points for Romney's who voted probably Thirteen fourteen points for ah for for President Trump\nA and they've been up for grabs I think the Democrats than making very good kind of momentum with them I don't think\nThis cabinet nominations never help that I always thought that a woman nominee who even a woman nominees for what might have been more conservative [noise] what would actually have been the right strategic choice here\nI I think the Republicans have held on to the working class voters Trump took but those are the voters are up for grabs and I don't see anything coming out of the Republicans to women back\nYeah well the again you would think the economy which is of course on fire women care about prosperity and security and all those issues that Trump is focused on 'em but nevertheless at twenty September twenty six us see uh LA Times poll\nCounted twenty eight ... percent point advantage for Democrats among all women a twenty eight percent advantage\nAmong married white college educated woman women a group long tied to the G O P the Republican now lead by only five points they had a much bigger\nA much bigger lead among that group of women before but now those are low as well\nUm is is is this is a substantial block or the married college educated\nWomen that's a substantial block but among all women I mean I I think a lot of this might be tone you know Trump's tone women like things calm they're like things to be calm down and I think that they they sense that things are chaotic and\nThey seem to be blaming the Republicans for that maybe the stuff for the last couple of weeks might change that I don't know\nBut they're also more skeptical about the economic progress if you look men are like wow this economy is through the roof women who as you rightly pointed out typically are even more concerned about the economy\nAnd its effect on them and their family or less understanding of an improved economy and that's another area\nLow as well um is is is this is a substantial block or the married\nCollege educated women and that's a substantial block but among all women I mean I I think a lot of this might be tone you know Trump the tone women like things calm they're like things to be calm down and I think that they they sense that things are chaotic and\nThey seem to be blaming the Republicans for that maybe this stuff for the last couple of weeks might change that I don't know\nWell but they're also more skeptical about the economic progress if you look men are like wow this economy is through the roof women who as you rightly pointed out typically are even more concerned about the economy\nAnd its effect on them and their family or less understanding of an improved economy and that's another area where the Republicans have really failed to drive their message what every day every day that the the national question is is she\nRapists or not\nThis is a day that nobody's focus more on the economy I mean you've seen the last day or two incredible job numbers come out and the focus is primarily you know in the cabinet issue and it's going to stay that way at least through you know middle of next week probably\nYeah and that's um I think that's why Mitch McConnell wants this vote to happen as soon as possible this is what my barnacles said this morning on MSNBC let's listen\nA lot of Republicans have come home and the state of Florida and the Gillum racing was comfortably ahead you can go to other states that show again the races are tightening in do you think that they perhaps Donald Trump is seen data that shows that this is driving conservative and conservative voting base\nUp back home of course he didn't do plays exactly to Donald Trump strength the one thing he is an expert in is resentment and specifically in this case white male resentment\nMale resentment um I think the white privilege discussion is driving even more men now to the Republican Party I think people are really getting tired of this identity politics a mark I I think that that Democrats have gone way too far in a\n... ... as you do a for a long time I I've been against both class warfare an identity politics\nAs a as a moderate Democrat you know I've always been against those two in favor of current or the right kind of you know social policies and balance I think what's really happening here is that\nThe Democrats were completely energize\nThey were looking for an opportunity to vote against Trump\nAnd the Republicans without a leader without a particular message we're incredibly disorganized\nAnd I do think this thing has awakened the Republican base you know in a in a way that it's backfiring on the Democrats unfortunately uh [noise] I think they still have an edge but I think they probably could have had to wipe out the way this thing was heading\nAnd and now I think you're going to see it kind of a balance among turn out here\nBecause the stakes of this election have been just raised you know so high now\nYeah and I I Do think that again you see what the Republicans are capable of when they stand United with the exception of the\nThree I'm more liberal Republicans who you know are are dragging their feet on the on the nomination or the party one of the United it's pretty formidable I mean even a bunch of older white [laughter] it's a pretty formidable ... never seen Mitch McConnell so\nYou know so good at ... he's been in the last week just as a political matter\nWell but see that's ironic thing that I think it's particularly see this in the Senate races and I think you see a lot of the Senate races\nCould have had a wipe out the way this thing was heading and and now I think you're going to see it kind of a balance among turn out here because the stakes of this election have been just raised you know so high now\nYeah and I I Do think that again you see what the Republicans are capable of when they stand United with the exception of the\nThree I'm more liberal Republicans who you know are are dragging their feet on the on the nomination ah but the party when it's United it's pretty formidable I mean even a bunch of older white it's a pretty formidable ... never seen Mitch McConnell so\nYou know so good at these been in the last week just as a political matter\nBook but see that's ironic thing that I think it's particularly see this in the Senate races and I think you see a lot of the Senate races\nTighten up because the Republicans are coming home and there's no question that this Kevin ... is a highly partisan ice vote and if you're in a state that voted forty courts for Trump you know there's no question that there's going to be a large percentage more way above a majority that would want to see confirmatory in the Senate this has\nDone a lot I think for the Republicans you know in the house you know not so much you know Ryan quit his job at the end didn't leave there's no leadership there is no message we're we're McConnell or as you say has stepped up maybe some people think wait we may be some people\nYou know what I think too harshly but as you said he stepped up you've got a message leading in the house there's nothing\nYeah I have to read or less\nIt's rather lists and at the Paul Ryan should've left if he's going to retire should've left to let this thing it'd be taken over by somebody wants to fight for these issues Paul Ryan's basically not even a factor right now I'm Mark Penn thank you so much for joining us it's always great to talk to you on radio and on the angle will take a break\nEight five five forty Laura do you believe that this uh the politics of rage that we're seeing right now I think people that Trump was embodied the politics of rage\nBut now it seems like the Democrats have taken on that role at least during this cabin I issue\nHow does that translate in November are you voting have you vote are some people have already voted you voting early encouraging others to vote or you got to spread the good news if you believe in going forward in this economy and you believe in its basic principle of fairness and as mark said if you really shy away from my identity politics\nA political correctness used as a cudgel to silence people you've got to vote get a get out there and vote and vote Republican don't go away\nThe Republican year will be a Democrat and Republican\nYou been able to do something my

and what's going on as a microcosm of the the existential struggle we're in with the left today and it's why I Am so happy that we have a a general in charge and Donald Trump because he fights back in

they become a parity that they demand more time they never were going to accepting they pre announce that they would reject him and it's despicable I'm sick of our side or some people on our side accommodating them and falling for it and flaking out so I'm hoping this'll\nPut the nail the coughing on this thing and get Kavanaugh confirmed because as you said he's one of the most qualified and and and want one of those things is worried people find judicial temperament that we've ever seen nominated\nWell I think again this could be a very big gift for the Republicans going forward David because that they're Democrats or the party of resistance and intimidation rabble rousing in chaos and meanwhile Trump\nIs slowly but surely delivering on these promises he made he still you know we don't have the wall which is Congress this fall but we did read it NAFTA\nHe's getting the NATO nations to pay more of their fair share he got that tax reform through again it's not everything we wanted the economy is humming he's gotten a I think now it's more than a seventh of all federal judges are Trump\nAppointees uh and obviously if Kavanaugh gets confirmed and I think he will be confirmed that means they'll have to ... amazing justices on the court which will of course they will live long path a Trump Administration and have a profound effect on the judiciary going forward\nYeah and and some people say well the reason you guys want Trump is just because we're gorgeous well no it's not just because of him it's because\nAll the other judicial appointments his foreign policy is the economy it's taxes and its regulations it's better trade deals that say it's standing up to the left and finally we have a warrior in there who will fight with the same relentless this has left us fighting and we don't have to be dirty like they are we just have to fight with the same intensity\nAnd realize that we're in a in a in a serious battle to preserve our values and our freedoms so I'm I'm feeling really good about what's going on I don't know where Jeff Flake is and where mccaskey and all the others are columns but I'm hoping with this FBI favorable

own life\n[noise] ah well I'm I'm going through the New Testament when I when I became a Christian I was on fire for the Bible cause I realize for the first time in my life it was the word of God I was holding in my hands and I started\nInhaling everything I could about learning about it wishing that I had something some some books some guys in ... that would help me understand it better to be less intimidated so as I've studied this for Twenty years I wanted to give back\nAnd start writing books that would help explain the Bible and so the last book I wrote was about the gospels\nAnd ... put it paraphrased in and stay to most of the verses and the gospels in chronological order and also running commentary and this\nBook Jesus has risen is about the book of acts the history of the early church which follows the gospels and then six of false Thirteen of pistols their letters that he wrote to the early churches that he formed the planet and they were they were dissipating from the\nThe true gospel they were following falls teachers and he would write letters and they're very heartfelt human and personal letters\nUrging them back to the true faith and they were experiencing the same kind of of\nAdversity and opposition and secular influences core and it was a hotbed of sexual immorality and I dollar tree with the ... the pagan influences and Paul would say don't follow those people don't mix and sinker ties their religion with our religion Jesus Christ as the son of God to follow him and come back\nAnd we see the same kinds of things occurring in our society today they're happening in the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church there's there's the conflict in adversity from within trying to dilute the gospel which has faith in Jesus Christ alone\nTo salvation and we see people mixing that up and mixing that message to the detriment of all potential converts and so we want to ... to the truth and and encourage people to\nUnderstand what the Bible really says some might the goal in my books is to help people\nUnderstand what the Bible is about and encourage them ultimately to read it for themselves\nTell us about the most unlikely of Christ disciples Paul\nYes Paul was a a an observant Jew and and he was steeped in the Jewish law the mosaic law and when and he was a great persecuted Christians because he didn't just believe that the Christians were new competing religion but that they were perverting\nThe religion of God and\nAnd it was Judy as was a religion of God's ... and ... there's nothing a false about that but Paul was outraged that they were doing this Jesus can't possibly be the messiah because they expected the Jews expected a military our political uh deliver from the the forces that the authorities at the time\nThan what the Bible is about and encourage them ultimately to read it for themselves\nTell us about the most unlikely of Christ disciples Paul\nYes Paul was a a an observant Jew and and he was steeped in the Jewish law the mosaic law and when and he was a great persecuted Christians because he didn't just believe that the Christians were a new competing religion but that they were perverting\nThe religion of God

that the Jews expected a military our political I deliver from the the\nForces that the authorities at the time and I didn't expect someone to be humiliated and die on the cross anybody who was\nA hung on a tree was a curse according to the Old Testament law Jesus not only didn't deliver them victory he didn't even raise a hand in his own defense and he was killed on the cross\nAnd so he can't be the messiah and then so he's in St Paul's going around ... rounding Christians up and in fact he was on his way to Damascus and under authority of the San ... to pick up Christians and bring them back to to punish them and when Christ encountered him on the Damascus road blind them with light and converted him\nTo from the ... the greatest persecute or to the greatest evangelists ... Paul\nThen long story short went around throughout the Roman empire Asia Minor all around and that in that periphery of the Roman empire and establish churches and they were as if they were his new\nBorn babies he wanted to nurture them and write them letters and make sure they stay true to the faith as I mentioned a minute ago but he was the least likely person to become the greatest evangelist because he was the greatest persecuted but God\nPicked him in the Bible says before he created the universe and I think he did it because he had those qualities he veers intellectual and relentless and determined and ultimately a follower of got\nThe part I think this is Mike around two fifty seven in your book um\nWhere are you talking about how the apostle Paul corrected\nObviously in the letters the Corinthian church um and it it was the way he did it was not with condemning Atari language or\n[noise] you know railing at the end pointing a thing as they are going to turn all damnation but it was with with love and respect and you talk about how that is a great lesson and I think I Need to take that less than\nSomething that we all do um because it's easy to get you know upset or demoralized or even angry at people when they don't see what you see but that's not really the way to change minds\nAnd he can't argue people into the kingdom when we got to be a little different than we are in politics that that\nYou know you you don't want to be too strident and he what he said he he will be all things to all people not meaning he would be a hypocrite and compromises values he would never dilute the gospel message but he would not sweat the small stuff so when he was around Jews who would\nAdopt their practices when as long as they didn't violate his basic core principles it was ... he would do what they did he would talk he would invoke Greek poetry to get into their minds and to relate to them and then he was present\nA little different than we are in politics but\nYou know you you don't want to be too strident and he what he said he he will be all things to all people not meaning he would be a hypocrite and compromises values he would never dilute the gospel message but he would not sweat the small stuff so when he was around Jews who would\nAdopt their practices when as long as they didn't violate his basic core principles is around ... he would do what they did he was talking with invoke Greek poetry to get into their minds and to relate to them and then he was present", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Cave Creek", "day": "04"}
