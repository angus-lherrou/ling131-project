segment I think he believes it tickled and opportunity for him to show he can do exactly what he promised to do and he's got a good record of keeping his promises\nYeah well with this economy which we're going to get into later I mean I you know I think sometimes Americans get swept up in the emotional moment where the headline in the moment and they will get\nGovernment and presidents have very limited powers in purposes\nAnd it really is to ensure mostly our security and then to give us the playing field where we can rest opportunity\nAnd a and and grow into prosperity as a as a country that's the primary job and when we start looking to the side issues\nOr whether it be you know a Tom said something you know saluted a guy who body slammed a journalist and he's he's now equal to the Saudis cutting a journalist to ribbon\nYou up on on that the emotional play\nThat the Democrats are trying to use in the midterms might not be effective given the difficult tenants out there\nWell I think my ... in my view\nThe Democrats have no agenda I mean the economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent and but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue\nA and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing and and the the murder of him and this tremendously literate tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey I think too\nYou know they're they they have no agenda and they're seizing upon this and tried to attach it to to Trump but this is or what exactly for him and his the Democratic party's great agenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do\nMore than they are going to do since the only house they can get I Believe is the one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one\nThe big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all\nFour percent and but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue\nA and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing and and the the murder of him and this tremendously alert tale of murder and the

party's great agenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do\nWhat they're going to do since the only house they can get I Believe is the one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one\nThe big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and uh now you're seeing some pollsters saying by internal polls\nAre the president's approval ratings are surging and that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats\nTo hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens what will be next year look like what's wrong [laughter]\nI'm sure did [laughter]\nBut now you're generally gauge as far as the eye can see anything\nThat can enact anything they can't you know we revised Obamacare and send it over to a Republican Senate\nThen shut it down through President Trump at the White House so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate everything they will be looking into his tax returns that got to be looking into any financial connections with Saudi Arabia that go to get the ... report there'll be looking into alleged\nYou know alleged a obstruction of justice and the Russia investigation all of these things and New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue you've wondered if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know\nThe goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up\nBut you go ahead and announced that is your goal and you shrink\nYour base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue\nYou don't get the broad based sort of the

he's running short of heart left or very far left for Texas a course in parliament for the Democratic party I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln or lost the Senate race in Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency in Eighteenth shifting\nYeah well aside from height to there's very little commonality there that I think you I don't remember honest Abe on a skateboard but maybe I missed that chapter a\nYou you'll find a lot about it I don't know what I'm going to put him in a corner you and put you on the record year do you think the Republicans hold the house and Senate going into these midterms where do you think the populace is right now you know the the the the people out there who are elected from\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take a house I mean that would be a dramatic victory over the Republicans and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold onto the shut\nUp they've got to lose a number of races where they're hit right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's going to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nomination appellate court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigations over us but I don't necessarily believe\nThat it's a bad thing to have Nancy Pelosi's crowd and in charge of the house and doing all these things with the American people I don't think you're going to be enthusiastic about it especially if they've got great foreign domestic problems\nMhm have you

the posters at NYU there were all these ... these little violence ... violence so we we drove recently called them the pansies anyway um tell me where we stand in these midterms mad\nOr when you look at the polling data a real clear politics has the the generic ballot Republicans down seven points does that mean anything when we're this close\nThis late date\nYeah it does is it's a great question um you know basically that generic ballot has been as high as fourteen Fifteen points uh CNN and had a poll\nDays ago or ... or so that show that that why is that what you're seeing is that in almost all the polling that they are now that's a that's a common trend that a generic ballots start off very bad for Republicans because their car a lot of big cities and quite frankly they're calling a lot of people who aren't at work which don't tend to be Republicans\nAre and as you get close election they got a better idea of actually going to vote or whomever raining in the mid term it's like you know roughly twenty five percent of the people vote so the Tour de ... is going to vote is\nThat's the real tricky question\nYup well here's here's the thing I'm there is this other CBS battleground poll that\nHas Democrats up three in the toss up districts now if you're only up three in the ... district that's within the margin of error\nIn the Trump total era I I have to look at that and say this could go anyway this this is yeah I like to home break\nI was in Florida for a speech this week I had a woman came up to be in the lobby the hotel I've noticed as a clean story don't worry as you said um she said hey I I just want you to do I never voted in the mid term I'm so bad about the angry ... treatment of capping off\nI'm voting for the first time it it it it ... this is this this is the silent voter dot going to get picked up in these old I think it's absolutely a dynamic is just as an Eighteen similar to how it was in two thousand sixteen there's a lot of Democrats who are looking at their own party\nYou know a Gallup poll came out rented that fifty seven percent of Democrats are comfortable with the idea of being a socialist party the Democratic party is shifting becoming much more radicalized and that means that in the swing districts that you're talking about that um you know the the the whole question about electing socialists\nPeople like Ocasio Cortez et cetera uh it's really wake you a lot of people at a normal folks countries say maybe I'll vote\nAnd I I I also think when you see these explosions as we just played from uh NYU last night attacking a above the statesman like Henry Kissinger\nI wouldn't vote are not going to get picked up in these old I think it's absolutely a dynamic in two thousand Eighteen similar to how it was in two thousand six teams there's a lot of Democrats who are looking at their own party\nYou know a Gallup poll came out rented that fifty seven percent Democrats are comfortable with the idea of being a socialist party the Democratic party is shifting becoming much more radicalized and that means that in the swing districts that you're talking about that um you know the the the whole question about electing socialists\nPeople like or cause you Cortez et cetera uh it's really wake you a lot of people up a normal folks countries to say hey maybe I'll vote\nYeah and I I I also think when you see these explosions as we just played from uh NYU last night attacking a of of a statesman like Henry Kissinger he'd Ninety five years old\nAnd when you see people yeah quite mental that's what I thought you were going to tell me about the woman who came up to you in Florida Man I thought she was going accuse you of being work on them or you know when you see that kind of crazy\nExplosive behavior toward people a that's a big turtles in middle America and really anywhere in America I think I think it's a huge terminal tell me about the Trump effect he\nIs he is dumping all over the country including in Arizona tonight we're going to be covering that live at ten pm on Fox\nUm what is the Trump effect has he nationalized what was a local race a few weeks ago\nWell first of all its historic better president would stand by a nominee like Kavanaugh end its historic that our president would basically go all over the country just aggressively in a nonstop fashion to campaign for all these candidates and I do agree with you I think it's nationalize that they can the era of Trump\nEverything is about Trump even if they try to make it about Trump he's too big of a personality he's too big of a player in our politics so yes it's about ... Republicans who run from in because they don't like a portion of what he does or making a mistake but voters that difference that Donald Trump is a one of a kind of guy\nDon't think that every Republican his truck they know how Trump is and I don't know why some of these Republicans have so much trouble just be yourself be who you are\nIs on the rise in politics and that's a good thing\nWell usually use the reality the Democrats don't have any stars with Trump's magnitude they really can't\nCompete and there's no leader and there's no articulated governing vision that's the other problem with these people um what are your concerns though Matt should the Democrats wrest control of the house what will that look like\nWell they're gonna start persecuting people like my wife worked for Donald Trump they're going to go after every White House staffer they can they're going to try to bring people down to their age this whole idea of the mob mentality that take it over the Democratic party will turn to dabble in power in the house and it'll all be about trying to get\nAir quotes corruption Trump corruption and\nEverybody that associates themselves with Trump they're going to try the same strategy Hillary try which Donald Trump his agenda is so obnoxious and toxic that we have to destroy anybody associated with it and it's going to be a very\nVery harmful and long two years for the country I feel like we're at our wits end already I dont know what's gonna happen if the Democrats dispatch which they will have to choose because as you said there is no with the other than stopped Trump that is the agenda\nIt what is your gut tell you Matt where does this and I'm actually I did I what do you think happens my gut tells me that we're going to have a fantastic night in the Senate\nThe Democratic party will turn to gavel power house and it'll all be about trying to get air quotes corruption corruption and everybody that this solves Trump they're going to try the same strategy\nHillary track which Donald Trump is agenda is so obnoxious and toxic that we have to destroy anybody associated with it and it's going to be a very\nVery harmful and long two years for the country I feel like we're at our website already I dont know what's gonna happen if the Democrats dispatch which they will have to because it's just that there is no way that the other than ... that is that\nWhat it what is your gut tell you Matt where does this end collection I did I what do you think happens\nMy gut tells me that we're going to have a fantastic ... Bennett I keep thinking you know be picked up in the Senate from fifty one I actually can be higher than actually many of these races like Claire McCaskill in Montana\nWest Virginia which um answer I think the Democrats are totally vulnerable I think the Republicans have a great at the picking up the the I think in the house with the coin flip\n'em I think I think Republicans do have a chance to hold onto the house but it's\nApparently ISIS terrorists have been caught in Guatemala this is on judicial watch his website we will keep you posted but\nI I got to tell you I I Do think Trump is right this strengthens his hand this is his issue border security border safety um stopping at a process that\nDoes not permit order\nAnd promotes chaos that was at the heart of what he ran on so this cuts I think uh his way as these midterms heat up and they get they are very close now most of the polling still shows democratic victory in the house but there is a path\nPulled the Republicans to hold the house it would be extraordinary very rare for president after his first you know middle of his first term they usually lose seats it just the natural political pendulum but\nTrump has beaten expectations in the past David South Carolina you wanted to say about it\nFor reasons I'm voting Republican Maxine Waters polo see Feinstein and ... I'm a registered Democrat and let me tell you I've never been more embarrassed for the hatred that comes out of their mouths\nAnd I'm not alone down here in South Carolina there are a lot of people because of those poor people and the vitriol that comes out of their mouths were voting for Republican down here\n[laughter]\nDemocratic victory in the house but there is a path\nPulled the Republicans to hold the house it would be extraordinary very rare for president after his first you know middle of his first term they usually lose seats it just the natural political pendulum but\nTrump has beaten expectations in the past David South Carolina you wanted to say well\nFor reasons I'm voting Republican Maxine Waters polo see Feinstein and ...

because of those poor people and the vitriol that comes out of their mouths were voting for Republican down here\n[laughter]\nFascinating thank you David that's that's insightful and I'm going to be down in Texas in Houston on Monday with a camera crew for Fox and um we're going to be chronicling what people there are saying\nAbout these midterm elections I think there are there are veins running through this election that uh I think the the polling is not picking up on and certainly\nThe people reporting news have no concept of I live in New Orleans I sit and coffee houses I go to lunch spots and let me tell you that is a swath of America\n... where in New Orleans we're kinda shoulder to shoulder with everybody we don't have these lily white enclaves or old black enclaves are all Hispanic enclaves like I found in northern Virginia and we lived here frankly\nYou there are parts of places you you you know I I ... you could go never see a black person never see Hispanic face in some of these restaurants that it it ... ... northern Virginia for whatever reason it causes up that way\nIt it it's a very wealthy place and people are very divided live separate lives not a New Orleans we are side by side we share a music we share food we enjoy each other's company we drink together we have fun together Mardi Gras together\nYou hear a lot when you're in places like that because the voices you're hearing on all sides are not your own not an echo chamber and let me tell you I think there's a lot of disgruntlement out there with not only the mob stuff but the tone\nThe lack of results from Democrats Democrat should've ... seems to me come up with a governing agenda I don't know why they didn't take Newt Gingrich's playbook and run with it they should have had their own contract with America saying look the\nTrump years we can't stand what he's doing but we're going to do X Y and Z they didn't do that they have no what are you going to do you're going to run against joblessness\nYou're gonna run against high wages you're going to run against high benefits business is growing small businesses regulations coming all what are you going to do well I'll tell you what Kamala Harris was announcing a five hundred dollar tax credit\nShe called Trump's fever\nSo when Democrats are coming around who your way of thinking even though they try to dress it up you once you've won and that's why I think Trump is nationalizing this election and trying to keep his agenda and his voice at the center of it Terry Alabama does that work for you and what are you focus on during these midterms\nExactly right I think the Democrats not look like they're evil you look at what they can't I Can't do a train wreck capping off a judge Kavanaugh report\nWages you gonna run against high benefits business is growing small businesses regulations coming all what are you going to do well I'll tell you with Kamala Harris was announcing a five hundred dollar tax credit\nShe called Trump's fever\nSo when Democrats coming around who your way of thinking even though they try to dress it up you once you've won and that's why I think Trump is nationalizing this election and trying to keep his agenda and his voice at the center of it Terry Alabama does that work for you and what do you focus on during these midterms\n... exactly right I think the Democrats are not all of them but they're evil\nYou look at what they can't I Can't do a brain Brett Kavanaugh if a judge rights have enough for what you know what kind of ... that they\nFall while I'm there we go out and vote and it's that group and they were told that that your state for a while and it [laughter]\nOh we lost you there I think we're losing your there Terry but I I get a point\nI think you know to to to too many ... the Supreme Court has become the holy of Hillary's you just almost a high church too to some on the left\nWhere they see that as the ultimate instrument of control and social change and deprived of it they feel they've somehow lost something that era treatable so this was a major blow\nThough a Brett Kavanaugh is it down the middle of the road straight down the middle jurors she's not a radical he's not he's not the next battle is going to be the battle royale you want to see blood on the floor come to Washington for the next round\nOf confirmation hearings when Ruth Bader Ginsburg gives up her seat and Trump appoints maybe a woman a conservative woman to that seat or more a a a rich restrictive jurist one who reads the law an interpreter that appropriately and\nDoesn't make it up if you get a let's say Amy Coney Barrett\nGod help us all I'm leaving I'm going back to New Orleans\nI mean it it it it will be what we saw from Kavanaugh will be a cheap warm
