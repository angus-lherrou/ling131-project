know I wrote a post on a on power line on friday and and it was titled or where do we go from here and it's gotten a lot of attention and it was a link to unreal or politics and a lot of other places and it's been read now by sixty five Seventy thousand people\nAnd and um as we have time here over the over the course of the program I'm going to I'm going to talk a little bit about\nAbout that posted about some of the things that I that I sat there and um and and and we're I think we're at what I think the landscape of looks like a in the wake of a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd really to conduct the the abhorrent conduct that we saw from the Democratic\nParty over the last few months and and I think the the implications are significant that I think that this episode is going to be with us for a long time to come I started this post where did we go from here\nOr by saying this\nRat cabinet I Will be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow bringing to a close one of the most appalling episodes in American political history\nThe Democrats shameful treatment of Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven has distorted our politics not just the politics of the Supreme Court\nFor the last Thirty years but the slander the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nAnd I think that's I think that's right I'd supplies there for a moment at the smears they directed against judge Bork were outrageous Ted Kennedy of course leading the charge there but many Democrats participating\nBut at least they were they were a geared toward his judicial philosophy which they massively distorted than lied about but they but they did at least purports to relate just thinks he might do it the judge here we have the Democrats are trying to claim that uh Brett Kavanaugh total Boy Scout\nOr was involved in in gang rapes as a high school students I Believe a ball or the smears that they are the slander as they they directed against ah against judge Kavanaugh\nSo I continued uh but this landers the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful we will feel the impact for many years\nTo come and I laid out various areas in which I think I which I think that's true where I think we will be seeing that in fact we're going to go to a break and when we return we'll have more about the cabinet nomination with\nI Believe a ball or the smears that the the slander as they they directed against uh against judge Kavanaugh\nSo I continued uh about this landers the Democratic party directed toward cabin or were if anything even more disgraceful we will feel the impact for many years to come\nAnd I laid out various areas in which I think I which I think that's true where I think we will be seeing that in fact we're going to go to a break and when we return we'll have\nMore about the cabinet nomination with\nGang rape or and you know he had said Sanders Democratic senators said that he was evil and you lose the liar and you know the people would die in the streets and so\nIf one isn't going to get angry about that I'm not quite sure when when one would get angry and I am quite confident that if you had remain calm and robot like that the response would have been\nWell clearly he must have done the things that he was accused up because somebody who was truly innocent would've been\nA ... to this and would have shown that a by you know being a little angry in responding to those charges so I really think the damned if you did and damned if you get into the fact that twenty four hundred a walk professors\nYou might as well throw in former Justice John Paul Stevens a leap into this when everything else failed a hardly surprises me in and you know there may be a perhaps a dozen quote unquote conservative professors among that list but I have not the slightest\nI doubt that if I Am in that list that it will overwhelmingly skewed to the left and that's more comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament yeah\nI think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turned no Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide\nTurned in that in that follow up here and when when a cabinet on cabinet came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing the I think ridiculous or accusations against him I think he needed to do that to show people he was he was sincere\nAnd I and I walk it and that's what happened I I absolutely\nAgree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and\nWhatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling no permanent you may or may not think that she did but Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point\nYeah I think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turned no Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide\nTurned in that in that follow up here and when when a cabinet or cabinet came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing the I think ridiculous or accusations against him I think he needed to do that to show people he was he was sincere and I and I walk it and that's what happened\nI I absolutely agree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and\nWhatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling\nNo permanent you may or may not think that she did but Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to cause her to be this emotional and I think that of Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now asked me questions and I'll be happy to answer them\nHe would have been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out\nExactly as strongly as she did and said you are now trying to destroy a reputation over a lifetime you are also by the way of trying to destroy the judiciary by casting doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people who served as judges and I'm not going to play along with this\nI I think that he he very much helped his uh his cause and had he come out and been had a flat aspect or when he would he would have gone down to defeat in terms of you know his nomination\nWhich talking to Jon Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation John let's look forward a little bit and talk about some of the things that I'm\nI'm the Democrats frankly are trying to do what one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here being undermined and and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participates or maybe don't need to be respected if they're close\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the production or they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this [noise]\nWell I have several things to say I think it is terrible but they are in fact trying to tear down the integrity of the court by making Eighteen\nOr that it's just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped self in that regard because that is involved itself\nIn more and more social issues frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people but you know that is what people are trying to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that\nBut ... before the presidential election you had with greater Ginsburg\nComing out and basically saying how awful she fought Donald Trump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to deciding cases over the last two terms involving ... policies\nNobody was filing ... motion to get her a to draw away and nobody expressed of the kind of outrage towards her ... her some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage at your hearing beach west towards Brett Kavanaugh of all after all only challenge the tactics of the senators on the Democratic side judiciary\nA committee you know it ... impeachment is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will certainly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they vote for and whether they vote in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeach but kept up and be very clear impeachment is just leveling of charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives after he would be impeached\nHer or to draw away and nobody expressed the kind of outrage towards her ... her some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage at your hearing at the beach west towards Brett Kavanaugh of who all after all only challenge the tactics of senators on the Democratic side of the judiciary\nA committee you know it ... impeachment is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will certainly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they vote for and whether they both are in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeach but kept up and be very clear impeachment is just leveling the charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives after he would be impeached\nThen it would move to the Senate just as it did when the house impeach Bill Clinton and then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote in the Senate before somebody is actually thrown out of office and there was no way that would ever happen to Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrat might\nDo this they might even file charges against them if they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh will be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we look at the at the cranes behavior not just of the Democratic senators but as\nThe Democrats who showed up in in a mob in Washington DC and invaded senators officers in all the things that they did attack Rand Paul the airport I may go on and on\nBut I asked myself why are they so cranes I mean it's really a kind of strange and I think at least part of the answer has to do with real versus Wade I I assume that that that at least part of their thinking is that there with with Kavanaugh's confirmation there now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court\nTo um undo what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there's a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being overturn\nLA step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they have been crazed uh ever since ... election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so I think you would get a large amount of this regardless roe versus Wade is certainly a touchstone a lightning rod if you will\nUh for folks are on the left have been predicting the demise of roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court\nAh starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one and that Susan Collins pointed out of three people who voted to reaffirm a wrote the opinion that we affirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter any at the Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course what the what the current court\nOr would do would roe versus Wade\nA chief justice Roberts tends to proceed very very cautiously only one current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has outright called for roe versus Wade to be revisited overturned my\nPrediction if I had to if I had to make one is that it's less likely that roe versus Wade will be outright overturned\nThan it will be that more restrictions placed on\nUh the right to have an abortion will will be more likely to be a ... that's how cases that tended to come to court over the last few years when Kennedy was there you'd have states it would have more restrictions or fewer restrictions with respect to abortion rights and the Supreme Court will weigh in on those but in terms of it\nIs full frontal assault on roe versus Wade\nI don't know whether that's going to happen anytime soon and frankly with the chief justice Roberts

it play now with the cabinet hearing which is you always take the female at her word except if she says she has been raped in which case you know better than she does and you declare that she has [noise]\nYou know has a new business is a couple of things going on here what is that the left has just redefined the word rape right I mean they've got an ideologically motivated definition that allows them to vastly expand what any normal person would consider to be a to B rape\nBut and then that they combine that with this with this idea and they tried to ram down her throat to be on the cabinet and hearing\nThat any woman who is complaining must be believe you know you you can scrutinize restore you can't ask for their matches up with the known facts you can't cross examine or in

at the first amendment of the constitution word shows the right of the people\nWanted to stay in the right of the people to peaceably peaceably to a simple and petition the government for Russia and grievances everything that we've witnessed\nThe attacks going back to ...\nAh the attacks on other congressman with threats of what we saw on television and I'm sitting here wondering where is the attorney general where's the apartment of justice surely by now there are there should be some investigation launched in regard to these leftist groups who's funding them I think we know what's going on\nAnd and what can be done about it\nYou know there was a headline just it's more I got I have not had time to follow up yet it I saw when I was on the air here where somebody I'm from the other side is is talking about how um people were being paid a to show up and engage in ... in Washington in this this most recent uh go round\nYeah I don't know whether the deal Jay is conducting any kind of investigation or any any enforcement action brought by the department of justice would have to\nInvolve a violation of federal law obviously it would have to be some kind of a wide ranging a look at you know who's financing and stuff and so I'm kind of you know interstate a conspiracy to violate various lines\nAnd I think they could do that but but I I Would suggest something a whole lot simpler I mean if you're the chief of police in Seattle and you've got an ...\nA rioting in your city smashing store front you know breaking up a\nPlaces have been hitting people over the head with baseball bats and um and the two by fours\nAnd and sending cars on fire you don't have to wait for ah for for a sessions or the department of justice prosecuting him arrest them put them in jail or if you're the the district attorney in Seattle throw the book at him you know these people deserve law in jail terms\nA big part of what's happening here is that these urban prosecutors are all Democrats\nAnd the Democrats generally view antifa as part of their movement you know there are the kind of like the provisional wing of the IRA back in the old days you know that's that's the activist wing of the militant wing of the Democratic party they don't want to prosecute and they don't want to put them in jail\nAnd ah so I think that's where that's where the enforcement really needs to be done is that the state and local level or the crimes are taking place\nLet's go to Cheryl in Illinois on line to Sheryl welcome to the program\nHi thank you um do you remember what happened to have in our lab and in Wisconsin with the newly elected Governor Scott Walker he proposed a bill to give the union members that choice public union members that choice in paying dues do you remember the hundred thousand protesters by stands\nOn ... or the country\nOver this act capital terrible\nYeah they actually kept inside the state capital [noise] ah they threatened a Republican legislators um they came to factors which entered a home as Scott Walker outside Milwaukee he was at the capital but it scared you know grandma and the two teenage sons\nBut really needs to be given that the state and local level where the crimes are taking place let's go to Cheryl in Illinois on line to Sheryl welcome to the program\nHi thank you um do you remember what happened in two thousand eleven and Wisconsin with the newly elected Governor Scott Walker he proposed a bill to give union members that choice public union members that choice in paying dues do you remember the hundred thousand protesters bust\nIs generally all over the country\nOver the capital terrible\nYeah they actually kept inside the state capital or they threatened a Republican legislators um they came to buses were sent to the home of Scott Walker outside Milwaukee he was at the capital but it's scared you know grandma and the two teenage sons\nA Republican legislators taking a bus to the parking lot uh there was an attempt to overthrow them at any rate he wrote a book about a Governor Scott Walker he was successful the Republican\nFitzgerald brothers who control the state Senate and state assembly stood strong the governor stood strong and the book is called and intimidated and everything you're seeing now happened in\nWisconsin but the people were so appalled even the Special Olympics were disrupted had nothing to do with politics but I guess the governor was there\nAnd the people just a Wisconsin turn red there was that attempt to recall Governor Walker that failed all kinds of recounts lawsuits everything you're seeing now uh happened in two thousand eleven against a successful\nRepublican Governor Walker and by the way they did balance their budgets in Wisconsin\nI'm calling from Illinois where we have a failed state bankrupt ah\nIllinois is you know the Democratic legislators ran in ... so that there wouldn't be a quorum remember that right in\nRight they hit out and of course the Tea Party exposed where they were hiding in northern Illinois in a hotel [laughter] it was just you know you couldn't carry on a legislative session without people screaming and disrupting the whole process and by the way organizing for America\nThe Wisconsin branch was a busy there that was Obama's group two thousand eleven act in a while\nAnyway I'm sure you meant you make

our Roland in North Carolina and lunch sex a welcome to the program\n\nHey John ... thanks for taking my call I'm sixty eight years old I haven't drank anything thirty some years but when I was in my

[laughter] ...\n[laughter] that's very funny ... I you know uh I probably ... my share of American beer and I guess I'll confirmed what you would you say I think it would be very difficult to uh the black\nOut from drinking beer I don't know maybe it's possible I certainly never a\nShirt oh let's see let's take one last caller Kevin in Florida I live on five Kevin I'm sure you've only got about thirty seconds quick point [laughter] [noise]\n\nIn my twenties when I was in the eye and the navy we drank as much as we could possibly drink\nAnd you cannot blackout gr ranking American beer and the last few or a I have a healthy or something I don't know why nobody ever ever brought that up [laughter]\nThat's very ... I you know uh I probably ... my share of American beer and I guess I'll confirmed what you would you say I think it would be very difficult to uh the black out from drinking beer I don't know maybe it's possible I've certainly never uh\nNever does it oh let's see let's take one last caller Kevin in Florida I line five Kevin I'm Sorry you've only got about thirty seconds quick point [noise] [noise]\nFor a quick I I've I've watched the whole Brett Kavanaugh and doctor or a but it kind of relates to a movie\nA series called Thirteen we reasons why everything that happened in that series a from the gang rapes to drinking everything and it also happened to a very prominent kid in that are in that series\nAlright who knows you may be right we've got to go to a break we'll be joined by guests Adam Michelle when we return\nIt's really interesting because in the rock Obama economy was great if you were an app designer or a Wall Street a financial guy you know most people did did did very very well and pretty much everybody else I didn't do so well\nAnd now a President Trump is really fulfilling his his promises or to pursue policies that lift the middle class that left people all across America not just on the east coast in the west coast\nIn particular they give opportunity to people starting out at the bottom of the totem pole it's really striking I think how successful his policies have been\n[noise] yeah\nI agree I think it sort of as an economist I knew that uh that that tax reform was good for the economy that regulations were were a drag on economic growth but ah it's been it's been incredible to see how how transformative some of the these reforms can be it a bit just\nUnleashing the power of businesses to hire people when they need them and to ah to grow their business is how they see fit is or Israeli a transformative across the board\nIt really is you know I I checked the Rasmussen survey this morning a President Trump has been rising in that in that poll which is the only one that's done on a daily tracking bases are currently\nGive opportunity to people starting out at the bottom of the totem pole it's really striking I think how successful his policies have been\n[noise] yeah I agree I think we are sort of as an economist I knew that\nUh that that tax reform was good for the economy regulations where it where it drag on economic growth but ah it's been it's been incredible to see how how transformative some of the these reforms can be it a bit\nOf an reaching the power of businesses to hire people when they need them and to ah to grow their business is how they see fit is that is really a transformative across the board\nIt really is you know I I checked the Rasmussen survey this morning a President Trump has been rising in that in that poll which is the only one that's done on a daily tracking bases are currently\nAnd it shows a President Trump was fifty one percent approval forty seven percent disapproval which is which is one of the best ratings that he's had\n'em and and a strong approval Rasmussen causes the approval and the difference between stronger approval and strong disapproval there are now just as many voters who strongly approve of Trump is there are who strongly disapprove of him meaning that his approval index is\nRight now at zero doesn't it doesn't sound great if you don't know about the history here but at the same point in in the Obama administration Brock Obama's approval index was minus eleven\nSo Trump's at at this moment is a eleven points better\nSo we're seeing people across the country they're responding to something a ... why don't you think yeah are they responding to the economy or they responded to the the outrageous conduct of the Democrats in relation to the cabinet appointment or is it some of each\nYeah you know I think it's a it's all the above it both the things that have been happening but I think the more that you think about what could happen in the future uh it it really is a stark discrepancy between\nThe two futures that are in front of us are right now that uh that that that left is literally campaigning on the slogan ripped you'll Trump tax cuts and and what that what that means that you're at the Heritage Foundation with actually calculated what it means that the average\nA tax payer in America and and with a combination of the tax cuts that was asked last year and the economic growth projected over over the future the tax cuts are are repealed and the next year or two that could be twenty six twenty seven thousand dollars of\nLast take home pay that that that sort of typical American can expect and that's a\nThat that that that should be scary to to most American that that all of this prosperity could be a could be reversed with the er what by simply repealing somebody's big pieces that that the the house and the Senate and oppressed and have have put through\nYou know it's interesting just an hour or so ago the president was about to leave the White House on a helicopter he's on the White House lawn and he walks past dollars on these reporters and they start yelling questions that are made stops to answer their questions\nAnd there's a bunch of questions about the cabin on nomination and and and there were questions about some other things but at one point he talked about Venezuela\nAnd he said yeah if the Democrats get their way or you know all these socialist they're popping up now they want us to be like Venezuela\nAnd I was really glad to hear him say that because you know it's amazing to me that that rather than recognizing the successes that the free market policies are going to minister Asian have enjoyed the Democrats just\nBlindly deny those success incidence dead one after another they're coming out and socialists\nAnd when you look at what's happened in any socialist country around\nJust an hour or so ago the president was about to leave um the White House on a helicopter he's on the White House lawn and he walked past all these all these reporters and they started yelling questions enemies tops answer their questions and there's a bunch of questions about the cabinet nomination and and and there were questions about some other things but at one point he talked about Venezuela\nAnd he said yeah if the Democrats get their way are all these socialist they're popping up now they want us to be like Venezuela\nAnd I was really glad to hear him say that because you know it's amazing to me that that rather than recognizing the successes that the free market policies and the minister ration have enjoyed the Democrats just\nBlindly deny those successes in instead one after another they're coming out and socialists\nAnd when you look at what's happened in any socialist country around the world most recently in Venezuela you know you can tell when you're reaching the later stages of socialism because there are no more pets in the country the pet to have all been eaten I mean it's unbelievable to me that the Democrats really want to go there\n[noise] you know the the the record of of socialism or something like eighty six and zero it's a way it's been tried more times than it should have been at each and every time it's a it it it's crumbled and and left misery and destruction at wake and so I mean that's the that\nAt a very high level that those are the two that your direction we can we can shoot\nThe promise of the tax cut the promise of of putting more money in people's pockets is it simply allowing Americans to decide how their money is banned rather than sending it to the bureaucracy in Washington and letting it sort of lost around line people's pockets and then\nA part of it getting bad back out elsewhere that that that is just not a recipe for a strong and vibrant economy that American than American businesses no how best to spend invest\nTheir their resources and that's what we're seeing the power of of individual action rather than government action\nAnd we're also seeing success for for the average American or you know under socialism some people only do very very with no so Hugo Chavez's daughter left the country reportedly with about four billion dollars in Swiss bank accounts\nAnd his finance minister I think made off with even more than that so I if you're part of the ruling click or you're you're a part of the in the socialist in crowd yeah you could do very very well but ah the rest of the people are trying to catch rap so they can fry 'em up for dinner and that's that socialism whereas what we're seeing\nCurrently in the Trump Administration is real progress being made all up and down the economic ladder but especially\nToward the bottom of the economic ladder with with new entrance into the labor force in the labor force actually being able to get a pretty good paying jobs that are Michelle thank you very much for being on the program we appreciate it we've got to run to a break now
