year\nI'm along comes to Brett Kavanaugh opportunity\nTo demonstrate in a substantive way that you stand with North Dakota and ... and with President Trump when he is right for North Dakota and of course she not only did she fought against the confirmation of of a great judge who's by the way very good for North Dakota or many of his his opinions and dissent a defense\nBecame of course the majority opinion in the Supreme Court over things like EPA overreach and in in many areas what land water air a just a brilliant judge for for North Dakota when he's on the DC circuit\nAnd so she has this opportunity to to prove or brand and she blows it by voting against him and her whole brand went right out the window\nAnd then of course is like ...\n... she just doesn't fit with the north Dakota North Dakota mindset in the\nThe spirit of North Dakota which is one of I hearty courageous a well still still has that frontier feeling well then that's not very populous a state but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal just wasn't fair and I think most people just that you know and so she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the\nStraw that broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and\nAnd I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just blew up with the cab nothing because again her everything she pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration so and the fair to say she's really big but also she's a former state attorney general she was a former\nWell then that's not very popular um state but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal just wasn't fair and I think most people do that and I she's obviously not going to

think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just blew up with the cab nothing because again her everything she pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration so and the fair to say she's really big but also\nShe's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process or the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota never showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for a for opposing\nCabinet but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty sixty sixty four percent\nFavoring confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota and stood so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming her ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him and believed a progress report then she didn't believe him but believe professor for it and then it was not about\nThat at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing or you know with the phone turned often noticed his demeanor you know it's just ... it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed\nBecause everything you described about North Dakota law that the independent spirit the rug and is\nThe frontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be and now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nNo I think again people have been well they've been exposed during the Trump era\nI then media have had a ... mirror um\nI think raised up to their bias and it comes out in different ways but Trump really has driven people to just ... the frenzy and fury and upset and and the left always takes it too far they took it too far with\nKavanaugh uh we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump critics but people have a lot of theories there um\nAnd I as a leftist they're never satisfied with they get one thing and that's like okay we're going to go to the\n... and now we're going to push for universal health care is going to be Medicare for all and it's going to be healthcare for illegal immigrants than a one lesson that you you know assuming you and what it looks like you're going to um congressmen in North Dakota or what lesson\nDo you share with others who are listening across the country about\nAbout this period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going obviously the markets had a rough ride in last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the thing I Would share is\nLet's return to a respect for states you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states will show the way in North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states I Would consider bad states places like California North Dakota is the second leading producer of oil\nIn North Dakota or what lesson do you share with others who are listening across the country about about this period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going obviously the markets had a rough riding last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the thing I Would share is ...\nLet's return to a respect for states you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states will show the way in North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states I Would consider bad states at places like California North Dakota is the second leading producer of oil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously in technologies unlocked it but but because places like California that have lots of it has screwed it up\nOkay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life\nBut I I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at the state level and that's what President Trump has done he's restored\nYou know states' rights and and that's what ... what do you have a cabinet does on the courts and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you're going to find a federal government is far more efficient and much less not necessary frankly in many cases and you'll have a you know you'll have a much better country in my view\nUm congressman finally or a month at a time but your thoughts on the packages arriving at the\nOr offices of Trump's critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent ... and it's frankly it's scary but my my main thought is let's please not jump to conclusions let's\nYou know this was less than twenty four hours oh let's let's calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work and let's see we're all of this leads before we create something different than than the reality that that is behind it all in the meantime it's always a good opportunity for self reflection on\nOn our own individual behavior in what contribution that any we make to this this discourse that's going on this lack of civility and uh without pointing fingers today I think it's a good time for us to look at ourselves\nYou know it's a great way and I'm putting it um and we really wish you the very best in this election coming up on November

had an ability to to know that some of them didn't actually go through the post office they were hand delivered or one one initially said it was delivered by courier the stamps when actually stamped\nAll but a lot yeah it is odd and you would think of someone had to pay for that so they should be able to to track down who gave it to that person you know who actually delivered it trace it back to where it came from I mean\nThere has to be some kind of accountability to to a courier service to who who you know where they picked it up where they got it and how they got it there\nNow if it's an inert powder as it looks like it was again not meant to detonate um another comment that was made yesterday was that if you're going to send something\nIn in in you really wanted it to cause damage you wouldn't send it like this like a letter or a letter bomb apparently can be make much more lethal than a package like with a pipe that people kept saying that you don't send a pipe bomb like this through\nThe postal service because it's too easily detected is there anything to that\nWell I mean if you looked at her you know historical data the uh bombs have been put use you know

technical\nI'm looking at this again refer back to the FedEx incident that we're out where the the devices actually went off um those were intended to go these are these are expected to be found in my

you the latest as a press conferences will be taking place throughout the day on this issue with these or does it their terrorist uh ... they're not attacks and that they they didn't\nAchieve their go

political point of one sort or another but we don't know yet we don't know exactly what went down\nA we have a lot more to get to on the lower income show the campaign\nOr it's heating up both in Florida where we had another debate last night between Rhonda Santa and Andrew Gillum and now it's tightening Gillum had opened up a sizeable lead over on the campus of congressmen for that all important governorship\nIn the sunshine state and now it's you know about six points\nAnd Andrew Gillum is now having to explain themselves are given the fact that he\nLied on TV about accepting gifts or from a lobbyist well it turns out that the land developer that he believed was the land developer turns out it was a a a FBI had been surveilling him\nAnd it looks like he had you know walked right into the trap and I guess thought he could get away with lying about it I don't\nTo me the whole thing it's very strange with Gillum claiming that he's not under investigation how can they not be under investigation when the FBI had this ongoing operation involving him\nAnd ... with text messages now confirming that he knew he was getting theater tickets other benefits uh from someone who was ultimately the developers thinking favors\nTrying to use his brother Marcus as a shield for the past through these gifts so Andrew Gillum finding himself in a heap of trouble and of course is playing

apparently as honest way [noise] to the United states why what ... what I mean why wouldn't people come to think about it [noise]\nThey know they can stay they know they just have to show up and they're going to be given a asylum interview they state they have credible fear they give it a few talking points that are already given to them on the way by immigration activists\nAnd then they get waved into the country they get a driven to a bus depot they get a bus ticket and then they're off\nSo why wouldn't all of Guatemala and El Salvador and Honduras eventually figure out a way to get to the border and come into the United states they're not going to be deported unless they commit a violent crime and even then\nThey have sanctuary states and cities who won't hold individuals once they're released so they can be picked up by ice and deported\nSo we're making it an obvious choice for people who want to come to the United states and not go through legal channels we're we're we the people of this country if we don't\nGet leaders in place who do this job right then we're going to see our country ultimately lost do illegal immigration we have now more than twenty two million people\nWho are illegal aliens living in the United states many of them are children who have family ties here they've worked here are some of them criminals the lion share or not but they are here and they're not going anywhere\nSo the question is it true just drop all pretense of a border at this point I mean you could see the arguments just easier at this point that we don't have a border okay there's no border just come in if you want I don't think most people want that there was a great\nPiece in American greatness dot com about how illegal immigration has hurt black Americans most\nJust published yesterday and the reason for this is that\nIllegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work\nIn the low skilled labor market first and because black American a labor force it's so disproportionately concentrated in the same low wage sector that same urban areas where illegal immigrants flood into so there's little doubt that there are significant overlapping competition for jobs in this sector of the lake\nThe lion share or not but they are here and they're not going anywhere so the question is it true just drop all pretense of a border at this point I mean you can see the art of it's just easier at this point that we don't have a border okay there's no border just come in if you want I don't think most people want that there was a great\nPiece in American greatness dot com about how illegal immigration has hurt black Americans most\nJust published yesterday and the reason for this is that\nMost illegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work\nIn the low skilled labor market first and because black American a labor force is so disproportionately concentrated in the same low wage sector that same urban areas where illegal immigrants flood into so there's little doubt that there are significant overlapping competition for jobs\nIn this sector of the labor market so given the inordinately high unemployment rate still for low skilled black workers it's obvious that the major loser in this competition are low skilled black workers'\nWages are under cut by people who prefer to be paid in cash or we have fake Social Security numbers and African Americans are in other poor Americans are left to deal with this it's wildly unfair\nUh Bob in Florida on line four and I will tell you this a rounded Santas is the only choice for Florida oh we're going to play the sound from a last night's debate in earlier that demonstrates why Andrew Gillum completely\nAnd I played with the truth to put it politely about his acceptance of gifts from lobbyists and those who seek political\nFavors are political consideration which that should in of itself that should be disqualified and he's blaming race of course for any question about his ethics so we'll play the race card or a soundbite more coming up let's go to Bob Bob welcome\nTo or do you bring it up the road kill and gets elected with athletes Florida with like ... that's that's just the first point what felt\nLike I said about all these people are going to be down there at the border walking and people are taking them into his little bit of all those people were killed the two states\nAnd uh they want to be part of us without carrying her from flags while they all carrying flashing their own country slugs around they don't want to come here to be Americans do you want to come here to take what we have ... [noise]\nWell some excellent point of carrying the Honduran flag other blue flags that's a blue wave blue wave of foreign foreign flag or the Democrats and all this trouble\nOr ... why haven't authority has given us more information about what's in these packages such a good question people are asking that Lou Dobbs tweeted about that whether they're a hoax or were actual bombs\nThey were clearly what the timing in in the eyes of many at least people think they were clearly designed to influence the election talk about election meddling\nI think a violent attempted violence attempted intimidation attempted terrorizing I'm ... I mean we we do deserve information probably faster than we are getting it but I think they don't want to copy cats and so forth so I understand that as well oh let's go to Theresa Oklahoma\nTheresa welcome [noise]\nI Would like to hear these who are in favor of the illegal immigration pointedly asked\nHow much of your personal time in your personal many do you spend on humanitarian causes and helping your fellow man I have all ideas it's not very much it's just the soundbite for them and they ...\n... in the eyes of many at least people think they were clearly designed to influence the election talk about election meddling\nI think a violent attempted violence attempted intimidation attempted terrorizing I'm ... I mean we we do deserve information probably faster than we are getting it but I think they don't want to copycat and so forth so I understand that as\nWell oh let's go to Theresa Oklahoma Theresa welcome [noise]\nI Would like to hear these who are in favor of the illegal immigration pointedly asked\nHow much of your personal time in your personal many do you spend on humanitarian causes and helping your fellow man I have all ideas it's not very much it's just the soundbite for them and they really have no care\nFor those that are around them they don't have a charity in their hearts it's all about political maneuvering\nThat's a great point well I think again if you if people are willing to sponsor individuals who apply for legal of\nEntry into the United states sponsor them economically sponsor their education sponsor their learning English and be fit financially accountable for them and also civil reliable if they commit crimes I don't think you'd see many people signing up\nI mean we know they enforce their their perimeter around their house with alarms and fences and gates and and servants [laughter] I mean these people have more more of a perimeter then the White House and they're complaining about our border being enforced or say it's not fair\nI don't know how many people John Kades taken into his own uh his own you know governor's mansion and made him sure you could take in a few it's pretty nice house\nIt's a great point All right you're listening to the Laura Ingraham show a very tight race\nIn Indiana and we're going to talk to Mike Braun who's challenging the Democrat incumbent Joe Donnelly its its neck and neck it's up to point down two points\nSo this is a tight race we're going to talk to Mike about Indiana as a ... it's a reliably red state meeting a conservative state so why should there be any question that the governor of that great state where Mike Pence came from of course\nA should also not be a Republican strong conservative\nAnd what what Indiana and think today\nExcuse me ... ... ... excuse me for the Democrats are incumbents that it I think governor I'm Still have governor on my mind\nA so obviously Joe Joe Donnelly for the Senate race but I said that but I'm All right we're going to take a break eight five five forty Laura will bring you the latest updates on the tracking of these packages the political timing is very strange and a lot more coming up\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] very good to be on\nA so where are we in this race I mean I Know you have internal poll but I don't want to spend a lot of um an internal polls because they don't wear out mean a lot to me a buddy I where where are we in this race right now\nI think we've actually built elite there were a real clear politics averages and a couple of recent a public opinion polls as well as our and turtles from the capital episode we could feel a big boost and I think it's been built into a lead that's helped us here and\nYou know and a half to want to North Dakota and Missouri and we feel real good about it a momentum everything on our side and I really believe we're going to win\nSo your opponent says like well he supports Trump to does he\n[laughter] only on the stuff that doesn't count a\nVoted against tax reform and you know it was for Obamacare all the stuff that's really important he's a hundred percent lined up with Chuck Schumer and the liberal side of his party and that record being fully flushed out\nHere uh through this campaign and that's the reason we're going to win it with or without the capital\nYou know Bob but uh just a lot of good things have happened we brought a good campaign and we restore stick competitively in great fundraising and\nNot a whole lot different than executing a business plan and uh we feel good about where we are\nA well Mike the concern today and the part of the media these packages that arrived and\nUh the offices and residences of Trump's critics prominent people from John Brennan to Joe Biden or and what what is your take on this the criticism of the president was almost instantly even though he condemned this of course and ask for national unity it was not good enough\nOr and they're blaming him for creating the atmosphere that resulted in these a package is being sent\nOne of the president's been blamed for everything gets no knowledge but for the main thing is that on the reason I'm running is uh I wouldn't be running for ah invent another outcome and sixteen now we've got a rare opportunity\nTo kind of shake the system and fix what's broken and uh he they're still litigating I think the two thousand sixteen race and that's why he gets\nNo credit for the great agenda that's out there that's a exciting Hoosier Z and uh he was popular in sixteen here among conservatives and even more so and I even think the people that maybe don't love his style are going to look at the results and uh\nCondemn this of course and asked for national unity it was not good enough a and they're blaming him for creating the atmosphere that resulted in these packages being sent\nOne of the president's been blamed for everything gets no knowledge meant for the main thing he's done the reason I'm running is uh I wouldn't be running a invent another outcome and sixteen now we've got a rare opportunity\nTo kind of shake the system and fix what's broken and uh he they're still really litigating I think the two thousand sixteen race and that's why he gets\nNo credit for the great agenda that's out there that's a exciting\nWho's yours and he was popular in sixteen here among conservatives and even more so and I even think the people that maybe don't love his style are going to look at the results and uh I think that's why I'm winning this race that's why Joe Donnelly is try to become\nSo Tropicana and when you know you never you know he's been always is with the liberal side of his party's so uh\nUm I think this is just another example of how they try to distract and ah give him absolutely no credit for all the good things happening\nMaxine Waters said not today she responded to these packages saying I ain't scared on she called on the president to take responsibility for the kind of violence we're seeing for the first time in different ways well this is a year plus after Steve ... was almost killed\nAt the hands of a rabid Trump a hater Andy Bernie Sanders supporter and everyone seems to forget what happened if that guy wasn't that the security they would have been dozens dead\n[noise] exactly I mean if it let me of um I think the real exposure to this kind of approach occurred in the capital hearings and all of its challenging Democrats and these red states or the amount of just\nAbsolute negative lives and distortions that Schumer's packs dump in through George Soros than the rest of them are I think it's exposed and ugly underbelly of what they're about which is a lack of any message completely obstructing and trying to\nPlay down all the good things that are happening with the Trump agenda\nAnd I think voters are going to hold them accountable I think\nThe Kavanaugh hearings for who's yours would have been part\nThe point where our race changed in many others and I think enough was enough for him they related back to my race and many others I saw something Fox dead on across the board the negative advertising that just swamped the airwaves and that's because they're afraid of their record\nWell again the Democrats don't want to debate the issues because they have absolutely gone out of the business if they ever were in the business of\nA proposal to actually advance our economy or or grow our prosperity earned force the border I mean they're just not interested in those conversations so they resort to personal attacks and even on issues where they agree on to some extent like Schumer agrees with some of the things that Trump is doing on trade\nHe won't talk about those because you can't give the president any credit for anything any time anywhere\nDoubt about it I'm going to be a great example in my race I took on health insurance companies about ten years ago to\nMake sure he'll be Affordable Care act the first word of it it never was and it was doomed to fail because you had big government hooked up with big healthcare is specifically insurance I covered preexisting conditions and no cap on coverage\nAnd law upheld premiums flat for ten years and it's the absolute ...\nMayor or grow our prosperity earn force the border I mean they're just not interested in those conversations so they resort to personal attacks and even on issues where they agree\nOn to some extent like Schumer agrees with some of the things that Trump is doing on trade he won't talk about those because you can't give the president any credit for anything any time anywhere\nNo doubt about it I'll give you a great example in my race I took on the health insurance companies about ten years ago to\nMake sure he'll be Affordable Care act the first word of it it never was and it was doomed to fail because you had big government hooked up with big healthcare specifically insurance I covered preexisting conditions and no cap on coverage\nAnd law upheld premiums flat for ten years and it's the absolute truth and it's kind of blown up in the sense that they can't believe a conservative actually might have a solution for what they you know that's their pivotal issue they think they went on and all I did was\nMade of consumer driven made a transparent\nThe kinds of things that you'd like in free markets and a great result I go to the satellite I'll talk about that and that's why we're going to win the race against the guy like Joe Donnelly and it's been\nA career politician that's never had an original idea since he's been there\nI think that again when you when you see how absolutely nutty the left is driven by the Trump progress the results the economy\nThe fact that he's not going to be back on its heels and constantly apologizing I mean that's the that's the type of Republican they liked the best they like someone like a John ... forever back on his heels and apologizing for being a conservative and Trump's is not going to do that and that drives me crazy and he calls them out on and and I think it's a little\nLong since half the time and we had that type of planes speaking politician\nWell I mean thank goodness that's exactly where I'm coming from an alarm the other thing you're going to get as if agenda\nReally healed then I talk about tax reform and I do think it's a incumbent upon conservatives are business owners value got more Django in your pocket share it with your employs we've done that by\nFurther lowering healthcare costs after keeping a plot for ten years and I've preached out all the time you do that\nI really believe that's the signature piece of legislation that they gambled would not be appreciated within ten months of people now adding up more money in their own pocket and if you get business owners like us\nThat ... gone out there in touted tax reform we want to share the benefits with your employers people quit looking to the\nFalse hope of a federal government that the Democrats believe and that hasn't delivered over the last two or three decades and really has put us on the brink of a financial calamity if we don't get more people in there they're going to be able to solve things and\nNot worry about the political ramifications that's why I'm going and there'll be more of us I think that jump on the bandwagon stick our necks out and joined the Trump trains so\nWell we cannot wait for election day uh Mike I think you're gonna win this race\nOr the people of Indiana and we have a huge audience in Indiana\nYou got to get out there and vote get everyone you know to get to the poll vote for in advancing economy and an America that's growing that's more confident and optimistic and do not go backward we don't want to go backwards to more identity politics more mass illegal immigration\nThat a deal with this with the new Congress close these loopholes\nAnd Mike Brown would be fantastic in the U.S Senate I I just can't wait for you to come to Washington\nThey're they're gonna be able to solve things and not worry about the political ramifications that's why I'm going you know there'll be more obvious but I think that jump on the bandwagon stick our necks out and join the uh your Trump trains so\nI'm working in after well we cannot wait for election day uh Mike I think you're going to win this race\nOr the people of Indiana and we have a huge audience in Indiana\nYou got to get out there and vote get everyone you know to get to the polls vote for in advancing
