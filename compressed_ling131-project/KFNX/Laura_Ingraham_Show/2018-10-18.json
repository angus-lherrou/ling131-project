as far as the order but at the you know an American citizen here I I don't want to just think that this voting is going to help what more can we do\nWell the border the voter has to be enforced the president's right if these other countries won't enforce their borders we need to put a we need to put some thought into how we are going to better do it here and he's got to ... and if it's a national emergency the president has extraordinary powers\nAnd drugs guns\nOr criminal element or gangs we've already caught them trying to get into the country and we've already arrested people who are within the so called migrant population who are only coming into the United states to hook up again contacts we brought you story after story about that\nAnd this president understands that they this president gets this like no one else how many have you saw the frightening the frightening display last night on the ... it was called meet the chairman you remember that movie made the parents\nSo it was called meet the chairman and I went through chapter and verse what would happen to various committees and the house of representatives\nOr if Republicans lose control of the house and let me tell you something forget the new Jamie Lee Curtis rendition of Halloween the movie the most frightening thing you can imagine is what's\nGoing to happen to the financial services committee the house ways and Means Committee the Appropriations Committee the intel committee the energy committee if the Democrats have their way five five forty Laura let's go to Eric in Michigan Eric go ahead\n[laughter]\nI Believe that the easiest and quick solution to the border problem would be to open the home studying act to all of the federal I Am for rounding border and as you can make a structure dwelling a part of\nUh being able to get into the home studying act you could just as easily make it that they need to put up a barricade a fencing or whatever\nAnd with the uh that's already covered the priority on any old studying at the open up your could wind up with a lot of our vets in the whole study which would be helping all the American and at the same time\nPut one hell

immigrants I mean I Can't even blame them because we did this to ourselves other countries don't do this we we did this to ourselves but now it's got to stop\nJoining us now Michael ... of course former Trump campaign advisor Republican political strategist he's involved in some of the key races\nIn New York he also had a great a podcast called still standing radio dot com to just go there are still standing radio dot com\nAnd you can listen to Michael who has a finger on the pulse of what's happening in these midterm cycle Michael it's great to talk to you I think the Democrats made a huge miscalculation and embracing these caravans of people who want to storm the border I think most people from all walks of life life across this country fine now this is all a bridge too far\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that ... a prime time last night do Cortez as a warrior oh yeah we're here for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino and his president or his parents\nCame here legally and he in doors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I worked as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats summer the death threats I'm certain ... gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him and your um ... or ... the Democrat signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living trying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools they're just out in the country and they're working and that like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much on to this president leadership\nThe president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I what Steve as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of them death threats I'm certain schemes gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him\nAnd you're right um the or the Democrats signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living trying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools\nThey're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much on to this president leadership and then on the other side they see chaos identity politics\nConstant cries of racism\nOr embracing the illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been a case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders it it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up in the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue in actually pass legislation to stop that this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nAnd to learn the now with ... coming toward the border and I think the president is standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met in Washington back during the Reagan years and you know I worked for Jack Kemp and it\nWas people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country and and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump and have backbone\nAnd would never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh\nYou saw what happened when the president just said simply nope I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve\nAnd confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh rethought spines grow in senators we didn't even think Adam anymore we Lindsey Graham was a hero chairman Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates\nFrom the strength in the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down that stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they tried to conflate like you mentioned\nUh illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that\nOver and over and over again and they're still doing it today\nBut it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch buckets of work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumped the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health a radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done in the last few years on immigration are shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same and that's a million people a year and a lot\nOr or to be decrease so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain a saying that the Gallup poll from June I'm thirty seven percent want the level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration twenty\nNine percent want it decreased okay twenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration and that those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doormat\nThe difference between somebody who jumped the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health a radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done in the last few years on immigration shows that most people

immigration and that those are the convenience factor\nThe inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration doesn't affecting your life\nYour kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work or in a different school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrants for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent less\nSo you know people don't want this\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's a very blue collar area and a ... year a year or so we've seen you know truckloads of illegal or legal immigrants arrested at a seven eleven on their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen\nA chain of Mexican restaurants\nAnd uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them cash on he just got a found guilty the other day\nOf this kind of crack down needs to continue because I'll tell you in western New York\nIn Buffalo where we used to be a strong steel worker town were not anymore we're we're starting to come back under the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here me these jobs need these jobs and and the they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats in the mainstream media spend their time trying to\nGas light them on this issue talking about how important\nAre ... immigration is to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're\nConflate against illegal immigration for president isn't against immigration is against illegal immigration\nAnd I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process the first the immigration process\nAnd then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if you got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it\nKnow and the problem she sees is it from people were all surrounded by people who are here illegally some of them are now over ... etc\nIt's an it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly ... it's you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own government and in one way shape or form a and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they ... it can't happen because because well without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right a border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but\nLook the cats at the at the border is is not ...\nIt's really worth it you know and the problem she sees is it the surrounded by people were all surrounded by people who are here

the streets in the ... and the aftermath of Kavanaugh\nAre and the Democrats prefer that because if there's chaos you need more government\nGovernment grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier\nThan when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long\nConfirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh the screaming in the hearings the the uh the people running down the uh the always the basement of the United states Capitol screaming at senators the the people trapping senators\nAn elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras\nThe mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed the people trying to literally ... with their fingernails

the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans wouldn't lose the house because\nA lot of people who were not measure well by the polls and twenty sixteen they call us deplorable right that people who hadn't voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all\nThey found a champion and Donald

the country one of them is Pennsylvania seventh congressional district where Marty\nNo Stein is running to replace the retiring never Trump or a Charlie Dent\nA thank God he's being replaced and Marty is in a tight race against Democrat lefty Susan Wild\nAnd this has been redistricted but I'm telling you something Marty as the person you all have to get out and vote for in Pennsylvania seven he joins us now and also it's an avid cyclist within the two thousand uh Olympics as attract cyclists does a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy\nImmigration trade all the rest are Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues are the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight\nHi Laura first of all thanks for having me yeah you know covering every corner this district which is now a new district Pennsylvania seventh district has everything from the urban core of Allentown Beth I'm an east into the cause\nOf farming communities in the northern tier worked district what we call this late built a region ... what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with this economy they're happy with what our president's been able to accomplish\nWe're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know other rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now a lot of votes\nIt's going to support the president's agenda on the economy immigration trade all the rest are Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues are the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight\nHi Laura first of all thanks for having me yeah you know covering every corner this district which is now a new district Pennsylvania seventh district has everything from the urban corps of Allentown Beth I'm an east into the\nTo the farming communities in the northern tier work district what we call this late built a region you know what we're what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with this economy they're happy with what our presents been able to accomplish\nWe're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know other rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now a lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what is at stake\nIf they flip the house on a ... in in Congress\nWhat what uh when when you see the redistricting that but obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add a urban voters to what it's traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district\nIt makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to are trying to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration where we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth\nPeople don't like this chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\nYeah I think that's really on a lot of people's\nMinds is just the the radical a resistance we're seeing from the left a\nRash of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter before we've seen it happen\nUm most people I'm Talking to I Would say the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform or we need to secure our southern border a and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was supportive that\nI'm so immigration appear in Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania seventh district although we're not a border state uh it is something that's it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty Susan Wild is they they ... they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman or because the me too movement the woman's march and so forth are so ... what would they try to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\nWell that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her\nPrimary or somebody on the ... are left now she's trying to move to the center but um her results speak for themselves or you know she she's she's radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy and\nBureaucracy no for an pitching the president in teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any of her commercials she won't say that any public forums but at the end of the day that's what she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen Marty\nWhen I see the uh the amazing economic growth that's been made possible by this president's focused uniquely\nOn the American worker the American people it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI I've been watching some of your a campaign or commercials in advance on line and the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks and smashing car windows and\nBorders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy in Iraq or see no for impeaching the president and teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any commercial she won't say that any public forums but at the end of the day that's where she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's where she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth has been made possible by this president's focused uniquely on the American worker the American people it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI've been watching some of your campaign commercials in advance on line and the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks and smashing car windows and\nIn a in raising the flags of other countries in America they want America to be a safe prosperous nation where security\nIs paramount in our our virtue is freedom a is always you know upheld and raised high and I\nThink it's job not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that\nThe results we've seen in the primaries they're very vocal uh you're right they show up in ... uh we we announced a campaign um our our\nBrand opening of arcane campaign headquarters the night before they threw rocks to our windows\nYou know so this is the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in the seventh district which in my opinion I was born and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life I'm a relatively young man I'm forty seven years old but what\nYou're seeing right now the resistance from the other side is it is it's it's really\nQuite alarming and funded funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth Marty not seen a ... I Can't wait to see you in Congress\nYou know it's\nWell it's all money it's your money at your country and in California I remember what they voted for or they are they're supporting and signed into law free health care for everyone including illegal immigrants in California where do you think that's going to do to the country it's already happening now\nIt's already happening federal services to

of it it's a it\nYou know it's\nWell it's all money it's your money at your country and in California I remember what they voted for they are they're supporting and signed into law free health care

soaring across the United states\nBecause of corrupt judges court cases creating writes in the constitution and creating right to this the right to that birthright citizenship\nAll of it it's a it has fundamentally already transformed entire states in the country or the commonwealth of Virginia this was a conservative blue collar military a lot of veterans and now if if\nBarbara Comstock loses in Fairfax County Virginia and she's behind them is a congressional race reelection\nShe loses I saw something on TV say I guess it was Charlie hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this Fairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of immigration illegal and otherwise and liberal policies follow always liberal policies always follow wear a mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the\nAh African Americans and Latinos in poll after poll will tell us that\nImmigration is adversely affected their communities\nBecause it has so I'll give you that a stat just a moment a doctor my Christian is with us or he is the director of the global faith Institute former Muslim Sunni who converted from Islam to Christianity\nAnd he's been following the media and their use of manipulation of this story from turkey wearing a Saturday counsel at the Saudi journalist or who wrote for the Washington Post\nOr is or was murdered and apparently it's all Donald Trump's falls Dr Christian good to have you with us or what how do we need to look at this story mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're you know it affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\nCigarettes for having me editor for the ship the local community and and you're right when you have a party that is owned by by them and ah ah you know those old uh guards it's it looks like they are often from inside\nWhen I I think actually this um you know story about a ... a reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we're not going to get the truth out there and the reason of that has this when you know many people that she doesn't understand you know this ... between the states and Saudi Arabia and try to point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and the ... and\nAnd also to dictators and so forth which is far from through if you listened to Trump in his last quarter on his before this incident look out\nThe embarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times\nThat was a big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East so uh when we look at this ends and then I think people need to understand that Trump is not I'm backing up the salad is because he loves loves the dictates of his off workers\nTo the reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we're not going to get the truth out and and the reason of that has this when you know many people actually don't understand you know the situation between the United states and Saudi Arabia and try to a point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and the ... and\nAnd also to dictators and so forth which is far from too if you listened to Trump in his last quarter August before this incident broke out\nThe embarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times and\nThat was a huge big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East\nSo uh when we look at this incident I think people need to understand that Trump is not\nI'm backing up the Saudis because he loves the loves the dictates of his old for personal gain because this is nonsense he's doing this because the Saudi Government the current government is doing a good work that helps them not states and he's in America first\nUn American interest a president which is different from bite and then Obama and all of those previous\nPresident with a lot states and why I'm saying that because you when you look at what the current um gum prince and the Saudi Government is doing\nTheir head thinking many fronts your number one is the other hand I think by defending the Islamic movement by looking in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia and all they are fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries they\nAre helping the states um when they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east there hunting big time they get on the Iranian sanctions are and how the Trump is putting those on\nBy living oil prices and and on all the stuff also the current administration or kind of leadership in um a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty that never ever be imagined before and Donald Trump is about announced that are very very soon\nWhat is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's an Egypt and Israel which is gonna be eliminating the danger of this conflict has been going on for seven years\nSo Donald Trump is supporting\nUm you know the government\nA leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those reasons alone and all of those\nHead for the United states not that dictatorship and ... plus adding to all of this we believe in this country that everybody's innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue as when we have to\nFollow the due process to go to the investigation and find out what's going on and you know I I tend to believe that I Am American inside out since I'm a great in the states but still ... over there and my ... in my home brew which you\nKnow nothing happens by coincidence\nWhen uh the president of turkey is very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time after the Trump Administration embarrassed in public and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the\nThe faster and the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of this incident going taking place\nWell I think again mark ... America\nIn ... in the American voters if they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the ... which again it's it's the it's so sad and it's so predictable\nThey always go to racism they always go to Nina phobia they this is all they have it it's women are oppressed in the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats the president ... I mean it's so predictable that it's almost boring to talk about the meanwhile\nRation embarrassed in public and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the the faster and the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of this incident going taking place\nExcellent point well I think again mark ... America\nAnd ... and the American voters\nIf they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the which again it's it's the it's so sad and it's so predictable\nThey always go to racism they always go to a phobia they this is all they have it it's women are oppressed and the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats the president ...\nI mean it's so predictable that it's almost boring to talk about but meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people who are about to cross into America unless we do something about the thousands and thousands of people many of them this is an adult men or\nYoung military age men who are have joined this caravan and are being supported by someone or some organization\nTo storm into this country to try to change this country electorally that is the goal here the goal is to replace the American voters who elected Donald Trump with a new class of voters who have no background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening and\nIt's outrageous and Americans have to stand against it total all it's not a die hard and what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I think the Democrats have made a big mistake thinking this is going to help them in the midterms\nWhen the Democrats and the left and the media that supports the left is a crazy and they have gotten ideas which is why they always go to this year's men and all the kinds of ideas that they talk about that means ...\nBut when I pay attention to the media and what's going on number one is in the last two days they start talking about how the Hispanic votes are not going for the Democrats but goes for Donald Trump and an historic away and then right after that they start talking about the current events\nMarching to the board that of the United states and what they are trying to do is to try to divide and to try to uh make the Hispanic\nVotes jump into the vote a boost and try to vote for them so this is a very well organized by the media and I have no idea how they do it\nBut I have no doubt that everything is it the night you pay attention to the states they talk about it for three days how the Hispanic vote in Fort Drum in a historical way and then all of a sudden\nWe have an ... you know a problem on the on the border and then we have to figure this out and do know Trump's days we're not going to let that happen and I think Hispanic votes watery and Americans can see through this because\nI trusted that when you come to this nation and you believe in that and we understand that they'll give you that you have you're not going to be deceived by the uh the Biddy filthy or works of the left and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian um you're such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nWhere we have to make alliances with people in in in countries that now you know we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that and don't keep your eye on the ball people because what mark said is exactly right this is calculated\nAnd and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic\nA doctor my Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this\nDo you have you're not going to receive the by the uh the bidding filthy or works of the left and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian or you're such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nOr where we have to make alliances with people in in in countries that now you know we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that\nAnd don't keep your eye on the ball people because what marks that is exactly right this is calculated and and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic\nA doctor my Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this is a calculated strategy get Donald Trump out there on the immigration issue and think that because he talks about it Hispanic voters will start\nTurning out on mosques against him and the Republican Party eight five five forty Laura the Laura Ingraham\nShow telling it like it is independent eleven hundred KFI [noise]\n... when it comes to crime cinema putting in some ... to ...

physically attacked them out of a race physically prevent you from running\nAnd this is being encouraged by the Democrats at the highest levels\nEven those who claim over not for violence of course we're not for violence than ... where are they why are they supporting this caravan approaching the U.S border that is lawlessness complete and utter lawlessness they embrace lawlessness if the ends are in their minds justified noble\nSo that means are justified excuse me at the end is noble in the end is electing Democrats or you can bring more of a a social spending framework voice that on the
