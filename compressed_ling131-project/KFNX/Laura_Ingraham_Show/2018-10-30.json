wants to take care of our country because for many many years you know there's better than anybody power leaders have been more worried about the world and they have about the United states and they leave us in a mess\nWhen the president chose that wasn't nationalistic any thought about it very hard and it is wrapped up in the connotation of a sudden this aggressiveness of dominance of one race and one country over another\nIs that the way you view the word nationalist when you hear Trump talking nationalism do you think Trump is as the BBC's Katty Kay thing there and MSNBC Trump is using

those things that they think make Japan special\nAnd I think for Trump and and it's it's applies to other countries as well but for Trump the same thing for him what makes our country wonderful is our freedom our liberty\nOr an includes the free speech freedom to worship right to bear arms all the things that we have guaranteed in our bill of rights our constitution\nBut the less has to grab onto these terms if Obama said the word nationalist and explained it as Trump is they wouldn't have any problem with it but it's Trump Trump represents an existential threat to mushy headed liberalism they know it he beat them\nThey have to take away the rhetorical devices and weapons and issues that Trump has successfully used against the left to expose the laugh they have to remove those topics from his discussion if they can do that they believe they can beat him\nHe is and I let that happen all the second migrant\nMigrant care of and have entered Mexico according to Fox that just broke here we go so Trump can't talk about that either can't talk about the assault on Mexican police I guess either okay oh let's go to James in Florida on line three James welcome\n... hey Laura let me tell you that was the best interview I've ever seen the president you know my job last night at all the points it must have been very exciting for you to be in front of a bank us today\nBut I I have to tell you that this is a show this is a another thing from the left they knew this was coming these people only here for economic reasons everybody knows it and the fact that he wants to stop this anchor baby goes right along with it and I wish she'd signed that executive order today\nWell again we're going to get into the birthright citizenship issue another issue that the left as completely botched

from our opponent or a\nA black you know that's what they do the last week of the campaign so we got to get everybody to get out and vote to keep the economy moving forward on immigration my\nOpponent has said you know she's for\nA open borders but we're sanctuary cities even worse and she won't come I said I directly but she says let the local law enforcement deal with it you know the caravan\nOr the catch and release the let local law enforcement you see how that comes from federal law enforcement and doesn't know the basic provisions of the constitution for federal law enforcement\nAnd what she's really saying there and this is what the Democrats are saying is forget about federal law do not follow the law of the land the rule of law is outdated or we're just going to make it up as we go and that that is a\nVery dangerous new direction or that are no Americans want to move in that direction and so what we got some huge challenges healthcare you know they want the Bernie Sanders thirty two trillion dollar socialist healthcare pays ... ending Medicare is you know it\nDoubled tax rates personal and corporate that put you an automatic recession depressions so that that's the direction it it it's just like you said it forward versus backward\nWell here's what I see happening on the left and\nI Would imagine that young people don't like to be told what they can and cannot speak about like issues that they just are not allowed to to address any longer because if you say you want our borders enforced then here for a mass shooter [laughter] I mean it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard but this is what the left\nIs absolutely trying to do they are trying to take your shoes off the table that Trump connects on and one of them that you connected on early on and you were way ahead of the curve on this was the issue of immigration\nOr the sense that we have a sovereign right a God given right to determine who comes in our country and why they come in and set the terms\nAnd

neutralized tromp on the campaign trail and probably neutralize people like you [noise] yeah\nAnd that won't work immigration you know Seventy to eighty percent issue the Democrats are being told\nOr not to mention it right by all the ... an article in the hill yesterday the Democrats are just sarcastically\nTaming on the issues and just saying you know well we don't have we don't have a party platform to run on why start out there that cynical they know they have not offered a platform on any issues and immigration is I think the issue especially in my district and so yeah you're right that the kids were loading up what Twenty one trillion in debt\nThan and catch and release you know these are all children of God coming across the border right like the cat which\nAre good people in there but there are other people that have not been vetted at all or any family that comes in with two kids that's twenty six thousand dollars to go to school for one year\nAnd who's paying that bill rights and you run those basic issues by the by the taxpayer and by the kids and say you're paying off this that you know we're putting all of this on your credit card you're going to pay it off\nWe don't do a good enough job communicating to the next generation\nUh the problem is they're going to have if you revert to a socialist you know do grow the economy I taught college for Twenty years last the your bottom up period a high end college graduates couldn't go out and buy a decent job now it it's just a day and night that the economy is just boom and the\nKids are getting multiple job offers wants to just it was really interesting it's just a job or belittle people are leaving their jobs because they're that confident than go get a better job it's been a long time since that's

[noise]\nI think again the media really miss apprehend where the American people are on this I think most Americans are probably shocked to hear that illegal aliens living in the United states\nHave a child and that child becomes an automatic said I think most people they don't focus on these issues are off doing other things Trump all of a sudden brings it up or like water and then you go to U. K. doesn't allow it Spain doesn't allow it France doesn't allow it Canada does allow it\nIt other than the United states the only really advanced economy that allows this bingo\nAutomatic citizenship and Trump brings it up and it's uh we'll see where it goes but I think I think it it just as a matter of common sense setting aside\nConstitutional a language which it does not require a what the left claims that requires\nA it's it's open to debate the fascinating subject are joining us now mark\nKrikorian also get to your calls eight five five forty Laura I'm Mark Krikorian is going to sell some of that for us Mark I'm\nThe president brings this up high yesterday and\nThe media that their ... response are basically saying oh how dare he how dare he dog whistle dog whistle\nOnce again\nWell I mean that's to expect and quite frankly but uh the president is I mean I think this is a smart move I haven't seen the executive order hasn't been issued yet but what I assume it is is that he is interpreting\nIt caused within the fourteenth amendment in such a way as to not automatically give citizenship to kids born to tourists or falling students really lately is that phrase\nA it's complicated to get on the radio but it's called subject to the jurisdiction thereof that phrase it\nAnd Mark Krikorian is going to sell some of that for us Mark I'm the president brings this up high yesterday and the media that they're ... levine response are basically saying oh how dare he how dare he dog whistle dog whistle once again\nYeah well I mean that's to be expected quite frankly but uh the president is a I mean I think this is a smart move I haven't seen the executive order hasn't been issued yet but what I assume is is that he\nInterpreting a clause within the fourteenth amendment in such a way\nAs to not automatically give citizenship to kids born to tourists for foreign students are illegal aliens that phrase\nA it's complicated to get on the radio but it's called subject to the jurisdiction thereof that phrase\nAmbiguous Supreme Court has never ruled on it there's never been any legislation saying that's what this means so it's perfectly appropriate in fact long overdue for the president to say this is my interpretation\nWhat's gonna happen if somebody is going to sue\nIt's going to end up before the Supreme Court and then we'll have a ruling one way or the other about whether the kids born to tourists\nUm our or illegal aliens are automatically citizens or not and depending on how they rule then whoever doesn't like it can you know try to do something to have a constitutional amendment or something but it but the only way to get this process even start it\nIs for the president to do this issue an executive order and what it'll mean is that the state department won't issue passports for instance to kids born to Chinese burst tourists good women who um and then somebody will sue ACLU will find one of them they'll sue and then there'll be a lawsuit that this is\nUm you know whenever you think about this Fisher mother was whatever you think the policy should be this is the smart\nWay to ski up the issue so we can move it along in the process of you know public debate because all we're doing now is saying well I think that this senator and Eighteenth sixty eight men X. and somebody says no this other senator and Eighteen sixty eight men why when the amendment was passed\nThat's pretty sterile that's not getting us anywhere this really is I think moving the ball forward regardless of what you think of the issue I think this is a smart move on the part of the president\nI completely agree we have to get this thing resolved I mean this Long Beach birth motels or Florida birth motels the Chinese and Russians Mexican south Americans it is becoming a booming business just in Russia alone\nOr and they're going around all the other restrictions on on what we want from Russian uh investment in the United states by suddenly you have a kid as a passport and your golden and your gold and the kid has if\nA kid has a passport he can go to a for instance UC Berkeley\nUm lower rates that's one of the reasons they're people from Korea and turkey who do this as a way of helping their kids dodged the draft once they get older because they can just hop on a plane and go to the United states and then they don't have as all it's a retirement plan\nFor some people 'cause you know you're having a kid at thirty well by the time your kid is an adult and has a job and is working\nIf ah you know you want you can sponsor you for immigration so that when you're finished working retire in the United states I mean there are a bunch of different reasons people do this none of which is in the interest of the United states\nUh it's it's fast saying we're going to stay on this issue and a lot more a Mark Krikorian thank you so much for what you do from the center for Immigration Studies will take a break we're going to highlight one of the key congressional races or that is a winnable seat in New Jersey stay there\nLower rates that's one of the reasons they're people from Korea and turkey who do this\nAs a way of helping their kids dodged the draft once they get older because they can just hop on a plane and go to the United states and then they don't have as all it's a retirement plan for some people because you know you're having a kid at thirty well by the time your kid is an adult and has a job and is working\nIf ah you know you want you can sponsor you for immigration so that when you were finished working retire in the United states I mean there are a bunch of different reasons people do this none of which is in the interest of the United states\nUh it's it's fascinating we're going to stay on this issue and a lot more a marker Korean thank you so much for what you do from the center for Immigration Studies will take a break we're going to highlight one of the key congressional races or that as a winnable seat in New Jersey stay there [noise]\n\nI think Trump is smart the court should rule on this\nBecause most people if you put this up to a national referendum not that that's how we do business here it is and but if you put it up to a national referendum this would be an eighty twenty issue by far\nPeople will test is ridiculous and that's why Britain Spain Germany Switzerland Sweden none of them have a birthright citizenship as it's being interpreted by the left in the United states\nUh let's go to Jay Webber Jay is a running for Congress\nLemon district of a New Jersey it's an open seat or the current um incumbent Republican Rodney Franklin send is retiring\nAnd this is critical the races very tight uh he's been subject to a violent threat his family has uh just the mere fact that he's running for office in New Jersey\nA and we're delighted to talk to him J uh this is a tight race and your opponent making Cheryl ... is hoping to keep the corruption machine gun I guess in New Jersey just keep that keep the liberal liberal party rule going\nYeah that's their plan certainly I mean anytime you support Bob and ended up for reelection boy that says a lot about where you want to take the country and and what you think of congressional ethics so\nTell us what happened ah yeah I Know you and your family or have been targeted because simply the mere fact that you're a Republican and your solid a fiscal conservative running in the state of New Jersey but you've been subjected to threats yourself\nYeah we did I mean we got we got a letter somebody slashed up our lawn signs stuck in an envelope and then\nUh enclosed with a a a letter suggesting that ah my seven children would be lucky if I were to win and ah you know disturbing a law enforcement fantastic uh they're on the case and making the kids feel really really safe and secure and my wife and I like\nYeah that's their plan certainly I mean anytime you support Bob Menendez for reelection boy that says a lot about where you want to take the country and and what you think of congressional ethics so\nTell us what happened I ... I Know you and your family or have been targeted because simply the mere fact that you're a Republican and your solid a fiscal conservative running in the state of New Jersey but you've been subjected to threats yourself\nYeah we did I mean we got we got a letter somebody slashed up our lawn sign stuck in an envelope and then\nUh enclosed it with a a a letter suggesting that ah my seven children would be unlucky if I were to win and uh it was you know disturbing a law enforcement's been fantastic uh they're on the case of making the kids feel really really safe and secure\nAnd my wife and I look at it shows you what do we do about it you know we're going to get to make sure the kids are safe and then a way to push back which is not going to be intimidated by some creep who um you know drop things in the mail and then a heights so we're going to keep pushing forward and the only way to deal with it just push back in stand up for yourself so that's what we're doing\nThe district in which you're running a the eleventh is a tough district Trump won it by one percent of the media and the left the resistance are\nGeared up their jacked up to try to run the tables in congressional races and run it against the president despite the strong economy the fundamentals of its economy are incredibly strong\nAh and despite the fact that consumer confidence optimism small business unemployment all of these numbers are incredible what are you finding out there on the trail and could be a media conclusion about this uh this type of district the wrong\nOh absolutely it's wrong because the leftist jacked up so early and you know who's jacked up the taxpayers are getting screwed in New Jersey for years and they know it and they understand it and the state has gotten more and more unaffordable\nWith every democratic governor frankly the Democratic legislature around here Jack it up taxes every chance they get so\nUh that's our message or Mrs let's continue to grow this economy let's cut taxes are the people know that a Democrat from New Jersey is not going to Congress to cut their tax is just not going to happen it doesn't happen in Trenton it's not going to happen in Washington and\nAnd that's the distinction withdrawn and people respond to that because it's their felt experience for decades they've watched Democrats\nHike taxes around here and then the blame somebody else in Washington it's not going to work we're going to Washington to to grow this economy and its support the president's agenda which is working for the country\nAnd you and your wife I think we're both ah lawyers or your your I Know you're a lawyer you just you're going to graduate and back in two thousand ah went to that man that it's a\nIt's an it's an okay schools Harvard law

in January and the seat is too important\nTo not get involved a joy ahead and I decided that uh we we're not going to sit on the sidelines\nA in a year's critical as this and come November six come next Tuesday we're not going to watch the returns come in and not know that we didn't do everything we possibly could for our country to expand opportunity and continue to grow this economy keep us safe\nAbroad and and reform those immigration policies you've been talking about so uh we were we went all in because the country's worth it in ... people have been asked to make bigger sacrifices and is to keep our country strong and free and so if that's what we have to do this year to help our country and that's what we're going to do\nWhen you look at the national debate\nAnd uh [noise] you know the Democrats have funneled millions and millions of dollars into voter outreach\nRegistration getting people to the polls have you gotten the assistance that you need\nA from Republicans and the R. M. C. and others to do the same for the Republican side\nThey are and see the end our Sisi the White House they've all been supportive of the president has\nEndorsed me in a fundraiser for me vice president Pence has helped me twice\nA Speaker Ryan has been in to do a rally you're always a would welcome more help 'em but they've been helpful they they know the seat is important and frankly

picked\nCandidates this year a dump it a lot of money and against us but uh it's a good district in good people around here who know which way they want to take the country that is lower taxes and the

manner we've already seen these groups for say they break immigration laws and Mexico and Guatemala they've employed violent and dangerous tactics as you mentioned\nAgainst both Mexican and Guatemala and immigration security teams the secretary made clear last week that we will ensure that our men and women on the front lines or protect and defend it and the president has done so in calling up\nThe military and ensuring that we have the resources we need to not only secure the border but defend our men and women on the front lines\nHave you I'm prepared already a and homeland security with the chance that the president was referencing yesterday that there you're going to now started housing people intense so they will not be released into society at large does\nAs they are being now because they're just simply aren't the facilities to house them\nYou know what we're doing is ensuring that we're prepared for you know these caravan size we're seeing every single day on the border we've seen that in the rapid deployment of the U.S armed forces will have fifty two hundred on the border by the end of this week\nUm we are continuing to ensure that all us laws are enforced and upheld but at the same time right now we're not able to detain illegal aliens\nThe tendency of their immigration hearing right now we're forced to release after twenty days if you're a family unit the words out Laura I mean right now we're seeing a six hundred and twenty percent increase and family ate apprehensions and the last five years we are a record number of family that apprehensions this year alone\nWhat that says if you have a child with you we have to release you into the interior there's also a hundred and ten percent increase in the last two years\nOf male adults coming with children than ever before\nWe're not able to detain them and immediately return with our us immigration laws right now so even if we have the space until Congress acts there's not much we can do and the way of deterrence to immediately apprehend and repatriate which ... which is border security where\nIf there were children but if they're individuals without children you could detain them at the border correct\nCorrect and we're actually repatriating about eighty percent of the male adults that we apprehend\nOkay well that's a it's a pretty decent percentage were record\nLow of mail um of adult apprehensions this year I think it's I get it in Nineteen Seventy one is the last time we were this low in terms of adult apprehension\nYou know so that you're able to deliver a consequence know

and his use or military for political purposes it's wall I was in the Marines today I can tell you is er is of children who were wearing the cost of our country to protect our country\nPresident should not poodle size it\nA former governor of Virginia obviously this is called sleeping for three hours a night a Katie uh you you heard what he said the president by referencing the military as he has been doing sending them to the border that that is politicizing the military\n[noise] you know all I just say is this president didn't create this caravan this caravan you know took off with no control over who started it and when you know in Central America but I Will tell you that there is no way in which a large group of migrants should be able to come into our United States\nAs a large group just because you were in that group this president has every right to ensure that our borders are secure and defended and that's what he's done\nIn the homeland security department people you know think about you know border control and immigration and Customs Enforcement ice as part of homeland security now right I always think it's part of state but it's part of homeland security correct\nAbsolutely so we got the left wants to abolish ice\nOn despite all the great work I does with human trafficking drug interdiction er and obviously important work and deporting a dangerous
