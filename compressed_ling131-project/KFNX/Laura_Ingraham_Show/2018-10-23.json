this is going to help them\nHere you have the president of states demonizing thousands of migrants coming towards was worth it effectively shut down the border to asylum seekers and refugees and so on

know you I've never I don't think I've ever met you but uh I I'm just so excited that Illinois has a chance to actually send someone to the U.S Senate who has a sensible pragmatic view of the role of government which obviously Claire McCaskill does not have\n... of the church or about Claire McCaskill orbit or the pullout of the what the state which is the third by the way right next door but\nAll my thing Illinois I'm this is just operating on no slave\nI'm Sorry about that of course I Would\nGo in this campaign and uh we're at the state of the campaign I Would say I don't even know what day of the week it is but look at the bottom line and you know is that Senator McCaskill\nHas been in politics thirty six years that's about as long as I've been alive she's been in Washington ... long years it's become a party line liberal I mean whether it's immigration or shoot sponsoring the open borders bill with diet fun dies\nOr whether it's the judges you voted no on judge Kavanaugh was all for the terrible me or that her party carried out you voted no of course that she owes her sick of the cream court\nJustices that or a McCaskill isn't just terribly out of step\nWith the state of Missouri of what people will this be voted for and that's where we're going to record\nSo right now I'm this issue of this migrant mob I don't like calling in a caravan of does not now that doesn't really [laughter] that doesn't really capture it in my view\nOr what are the people of Missouri thinking about like a crush like this on the border I mean it's a ... it's going to be a crush and it's gonna it's gonna cause a huge problem for immigration officials and develops for the national guard\nBut I think that the people on the earth really worried about it I mean I as I travel all over the the I have I have people talk to me about it especially the last few days I mean this yesterday every stop on mood all over the the people ask me they said what is going on and what the us but we have\nSupreme Court justices dinner at McCaskill is and she's just terribly out of step with the state of Missouri of what the people at the state voted for and that's why we're going to replace\nSo right now on this issue of this migrant mob I don't like calling in a caravan it does not now that doesn't really [laughter] it doesn't really capture and in my view I Wonder if people of Missouri thinking about like a crash like this on the border I mean it's a ... it's going to be a crush and\nIt's going to and it's going to cause a huge problem for immigration officials and it's for the national guard\nThat I think that the people in Missouri certainly worried about it I mean I as I travel all over the state I have I have people talk to me about it especially the last few days I mean this yesterday every stop I made all over the state people ask me they said what is going on and they what they say they got us but we have a president\nWho is strong and who was willing to take steps to defend the country on like the Democrats unlike Claire McCaskill who they're open borders policy of course are what encourage this kind of lawlessness and this kind of threat to the country and now to have Claire McCaskill the face of this threat\nSponsoring an open borders bill I I just can't think of anything worse I Can't think of anything all week I Can't think of anything that's more dangerous for months tutor for the country\nWell when you ah Josh look at uh the rest of America right now it seems that\nThe support for Donald Trump is growing in tennis highest point in his presidency which is stunning given how perpetually negatives\nThe princess I mean it is a negative drumbeat coming out of almost every mainstream media outlet even with that he's at forty seven percent which is higher than Brock Obama was\nA how important is the president\nIn this race for you\nTo report and you know Missouri voted for Donald Trump by almost twenty points\nOn that though that is a huge huge margin in Missouri which is still a swing state and it's because people want to do what they want a stronger America I mean people voted to rebuild our country that's what they were voting for my state\nWhen they voted for President Trump and his policies are rebuilding the country and they're good from Missouri You know we've got our lowest unemployment rate is decades and the state of Missouri job growth finally\nHitting new high we've got blue collar economic growth job growth but at this point since the Nineteen eighties in the state rural unemployment slow so we're finally starting to get those jobs back from overseas your wages grow but\nHere's what scared folks is that the Democrats Claire McCaskill want to take all that away throw it all in reverse reverse all the games and then go back to the policy of weakness overseas weakness on our border and the you know we just can't have that that's what this election is about\nJosh how has these all these undercover videos of Claire McCaskill\nHarris her and her staff is that resonated at all what the voters where people are are saying that work for a while we have to kind of line of the voters we can't really say what we really mean about a various issues\nThough I think what's been usually resident and you know the people to pay to\nTo have a politician especially lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their face in the open up behind their back into the sea Claire McCaskill on tape saying that she wants to take away the second Amendment rights you know he's a constitutional rights\nBut the belong to people by virtue of our constitution to hear her talk about I was to take those away from all by citizens here her staff talk about\nConcealing the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremist abortion groups to talk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama on everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri\nWhat the voters where people are are saying that work for a while we have to kind of lie to the voters we can't really say what we really mean about a various issues\nThough I think what's that usually resident and you know get people to pay to\nTo have a politician especially lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their face and the discipline up behind their back into the sea\nMcCaskill on tape saying\nThat she wants to take away the second Amendment rights you know he's a constitutional rights\nBut the belong to people by virtue of our constitution to hear her talk about I was to take those away from law abiding citizens here staff talk about\nConcealing the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremist abortion groups to\nTalk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama on everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri voters are are so close minded I mean that's essentially what our staff was caught thing over and over and over again\nIt's it's really the condescension the contempt\nFor everyday voter is really remarkable and people are tired of that they want somebody who believes in the state who is not ashamed of our way of life in this day and it's going to go represented\nA Josh a when you look at the makeup of the Democratic party today the\nPerpetual mob mentality that seems to be encouraged and even celebrated or by some of their top leaders or how does this you know and it seems like maybe it's just the big cities and this is happening it's not so much and\nAnd you know in in places like Missouri but if it's covered a lot in certainly certainly at Fox and other networks is that on people's minds the president says mobs not jobs ah and it seems like people just want things to calm down and government work for them\nYou know I think that's absolutely true in Missouri or you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill's offer gets chaos\nAt home and weakness abroad and this this model behavior it it is chaos than it is all\nAnd I think with folks watch mobs driving people out of restaurants screaming them down and public\nBanging on the doors of the U.S Supreme Court and shouting obscenities I mean this is not\nThe United states of America or this is not civil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but to try and shut down speech and harass intimidating even use violence against people I mean and have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder\nOut they're encouraging it as Claire McCaskill you know she is she's going right along with it I mean she is happy to see these ... employed that is not what the people in my state voted for that that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm the concern I think a lot of I'm\nA conservative religious voters\nHave is the social\nTransformation of the country and the\nThe idea that gender is something that is changeable and ah that you know that we should really celebrate the things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rights and the religious right to many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe\nHow ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\nThat you know the Missourians are leaving the constitution and they believe in the first amendment First Amendment guarantees the freedom of religion or to purchase to individual you know this was something where I spent most of my career I've only been in politics for two years\nYou met him back on I Know you're doing a lot of girls out there [laughter]\nYeah yeah but most of my career as a constitutional lawyer and as a religious liberty lawyer and you know the people I said\nFrom a nation of the country and the\nThe idea that gender is something that is changeable and uh that you know that we should really celebrate the things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rights and the religious right to many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe\nHow ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\nThat you know it was ... leaving the constitution and they believe in the first amendment First Amendment guarantees the freedom of religion or to purchase to individual you know this was something wrong but the most of my career I've only been in politics for two years\n... went on I Know you're doing a lot of girls out there [laughter]\nYeah yeah but most of my career as a constitutional lawyer but as a religious liberty lawyer and your other people said they are a fair minded people\nOr the you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe in the importance of value of faith and we believe in the importance of value\nA family and community and those things go around the churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected and I think they have the again the left wing agenda which has become so hostile\nTo people who have a so hostile to religious liberties just like a cough go through our Second Amendment rights just like it's become hospital to free speech we think about it what what the the left wing agenda really offer says you know you agree with us or you shut up\nInto that is just not what the people of ice they want people to this country\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for you I've met many reasons obviously substantive reasons when you have the right views on critical issues from crime to the economy and immigration so forth but I'll tell you why I think you're going to win is because the New York times\nIs already writing ridiculous articles about about your office in turmoil first of all you show me an office that doesn't have personality conflicts in in a and people moving in and out and departures and so forth\nBut if this is the best that they can do with you that oh well we had a well you know of a surprising number of purging departing staff from the attorney general's office\nI started reading this today and I was screaming laughing because it's just like they can say that about pretty much everybody I Know his office\nWell we are

force Democrats\nTo ask questions was should we do with this caravan what should we do with all these people do you think they should all coming to America do you think they should all be released into America including women and children just to show up at a later date which they don't do\nWho do you think should pay for their health care do you believe that a free schooling is what what needs to be done for anyone who get the foot hold over the border though the Supreme Court ruled that that we have to do that\nBut when is enough enough when it when it went in the human tragedy of all of this both inside and outside the United states going to be enough for the Democrats\nI think it's important to stop this caravan impart to send a signal to Russia Latin America no you're not going to be allowed to come in and in part\nBecause in the process of stopping if we're going to learn a lot about the laws of need to be changed and frankly Congress maybe in the lame duck session audibly

hundred percent correct\nDo not allow politicians to get away with these glib generalities oh we're ... we all were for border enforcement what does that mean you can't enforce the border that's being

changed so anyone who lived in fear of crime and their home country should be able to come here\nOr anyone who just want a better life should be able to come here\nNo matter what that's\nWhat the standards going to baby so we better get ready to double and triple our population really quickly and all that entails environmentally with infrastructure with new schools that need to be built a with

really a nation and while I Am a fan of people who want to come here to work and who want to come here legally\nAh I don't think we should have any tolerance for those who just want to you know coming across as a mob or care about it it has to be stopped\nA Senator Paul there needs to be significant changes made to our asylum process or to the entire system of immigration admission into the United states given what we're saying we had a thirty eight percent increase in family units crossing the border month to month\nUh in in August or September I'm asking me thirty percent year over year and it was among the highest crossing right we had since two thousand fourteen disaster\nBecause people know if they bring a child then there'll be released a because you can't keep you can't keep them longer than twenty days so there'll be released together and then they never show up so it's the Senate and the is finally going to agree to move forward to change us otherwise we'll have a caravan every week\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think we ought to scrap what we've been doing there shouldn't be a lottery system people who end of the country should be based on merit we should be selective on who comes to the country with regard to those who come across the border\nI Would say look you want to keep people together and keep families together do it within twenty four hours and send them back and the thing is is we have an immigration office apply to come in as far as refugee status what we've done is we've taken away all the rule\nClaim to be a refugee none of the rules apply so typically if you come in here and you can legally immigrate there are some decent prohibitions aren't getting on welfare\nAnd on getting on government assistance\nIf you're a refugee apparently all those things go out the window so everybody knows that when you come here to be a refugee so you can get on welfare and get into government ...\nMove forward to change us otherwise we'll have a caravan every

absorb people if they want to come and more\nEach year\nPeople that we can emit into the country and how many we need and will make that decision each year but uh we can't allow just people just to to come across the border by the thousands\nUm we're talking to Rand Paul here on the lower anger shows Senator Paul what do you think um are the most important issues facing the country today given everything that we're seeing all the great\nAdvancement we've made in the economy the Republicans are leading by a historic margin in the handling the economy Seventeen point advantage in trade and the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll a those two issues are our math and plus it's for the Republicans in in a tough midterm cycle cycle normally\nNow what do you see especially coming from the Kentucky perspective\nI think the good news is overwhelming and all of the obscure by the media you know all the all him being carried away with all the Trump to arrangements said or\nThe good news is overwhelming we have an economy growing at just an amazing pays over four percent annual growth unemployment at historic lows\nThe main thing I see as I go round Kentucky when I talked to plant manager says\nThey said we have a shortage of workers a shortage of people who are drug free with work ethic and so the answer here is this is a time before that this is a time when we should convert or work programs that are on welfare programs to hey there's a job down the street programs and I think if we were able to do that\nYou know we have a great future coming ahead and most of it's because this is what Republicans off in the Washington don't get they keep calling it tax reform and the president directs them no it was a tax cut a significant tax cut will return money\nTo his rifle owners leaves the money in the private marketplace and guess what the private marketplace will boom when you leave money in the private marketplace and so\nAll of that has been great and I don't think we can emphasize that enough and I think in the election if they come to fruition that not only the cabin all the inside of the Republican base but there are reports that early voting in seven out of eight states that are reporting\nWhere people can uh decide how many a Republican and how many are Democrats the Republicans are are in a big upsurge with early voting\nWhich is is is you know music to my ears because Tom Styron Soros and others have really funneled an enormous amount of money into voter registrations on college campuses which are overwhelmingly I'm moving to the Democrat Party or Senator Paul why should Americans\nCare about this Saudi killing of this Jamal ...\nWho ah was living in the United states he was a was he he was previously a kind of a sympathized with the Muslim Brotherhood and he you know he was mourning the death of bin Laden although he thought bin Laden\nBase but there are reports that early voting in seven out of eight states that are reporting where people can uh decide how many a Republican and how many are Democrats the Republicans are are in a big upsurge with early voting\nYeah which is is is you know music to my ears because Tom Styron Soros and others have really funneled an enormous amount of money into voter registrations on college campuses which are overwhelmingly I'm moving to the Democrat Party or Senator Paul why should Americans\nCare about this Saudi killing of this Jamal ...\nWho ah was living in the United states he was a was he he was previously kind of a sympathized with the Muslim Brotherhood and he you know he was mourning the death of bin Laden although he thought bin Laden went off the wrong track and got to radicalize spent\nMedia had been tied up on this story for you know a couple of weeks now\nI Would say that ah the killing of cars showed me by the Saudis is just one more incidents of things that they do that are not good for America\nThey spent over a hundred billion dollars over the last several decades a supporting the drop is around the world that teach hatred of Christianity and Judaism and Hindus\nThey're over ten thousand ... says in Pakistan supported by them\nThe Hakani network which is a group of a bad actors in Pakistan that attack our soldiers in Afghanistan they all the leaders of it went to them the draw of funded by Saudi Arabians Saudi Arabians fun madrassas in Indonesia as it used to have a relatively moderate form of Islam is a big Islamic nation\nBut there there's a growing faction of uh those who now believe in violence against civilians\nTaught by the Saudis so the Saudis are bad they have been doing this for decades and we sort of turn a blind eye and say it's all Iran Iran Iran we have to support the south is I'm not so sure that the Saudis are less evil than the uranium to tell you the truth the\nWar in Yemen is going to drag us into another war in the middle east thousands of civilians are being killed\nSo the killing of the journalist I Would say is just one more item\nOf bad action by Saudi Arabia but Saudi Arabia sent arms by the hundreds of tons of it into Syria\nTo al ... an al ... they they they supported the worst and most extreme elements of the Sunni extremists in the Syrian civil war\nSo no I Can't think of a reason why we shouldn't be hopping mad about this but what I've advised as we should quit selling them arms or should quit aiding and abetting them in what they're doing throughout the middle east and the world\nWell the administration and the president himself yesterday said you know they're they're important partners of ours so in the middle east is that not the case I mean they've actually assisted American interest in the middle east is specifically obviously when Iran which still is the largest state sponsor of terrorism\nYeah but I Would call the Saudis the largest state sponsor of radical Islam you know they really teach it throughout the world the people who came attacked us on nine eleven ...

so\nWell coordinated effort according to the intelligence officials on the ground there are groups actually organizing this I'm In Honduras uh remember there's and you know a lot about this or there's a big battle here in a politically between the various a conservative\nOr a government and uh the socialist government so there is some suspicion that a socialist groups in Honduras along with a you know open borders society and others there's a lot of talk about that here\nHave been coordinating to do this march so that it would coincide with the U.S a elections a mid term elections and create a lot of a political fodder to the United states and here in Central America [noise] one\nThing that I I find to be very disturbing are the ah are those who are facilitating this dangerous situation for

that in the last caravan ah they're doing in this in this other one in and others as you pointed out on their way or if something is done to stop this there will be well they're not a Sarah a\nGroup

were a part in these caravans the big first wave and the second wave that were put in the front of the lines are basically for the media are in danger are in danger every second that they are

of thousands every week coming into our into our borders ... absolutely\n... absolutely Laura this is not stopping I mean what I was down at the border and it was a very precarious situation you know there were so many men it was it was it was it was a bit dangerous I mean there was some concern among the intelligence officials there\nUh you brought up such a great point um that the women and children that were a part in these caravans the big first wave and the second wave that were put in the front of the lines are basically for the media are in danger\nAre in danger every second that they are traveling with these groups are according to what a mall and officials apparently a child a baby I'm with trampled on when they first the first part of that second wave rushed through uh the border and the baby was killed\nNow remember their intelligence apparatus has people embedded in these caravans to\nTo try to gather information to find out what's going on here who is coordinating this they talked about this baby that died\nWas trampled to death when his mother was knocked down to the ground a the baby was buried apparently asked by some of the leadership within the group to take the baby away and buried the baby so that\nThe Guatemalan government we didn't have any access to the body\nOf one of the reasons or the government wanted to know and obviously wanted to bring justice to the child's life with so that they could charge people that were coordinating this group with either manslaughter murder or because it's just becoming a really dangerous situation for the people that are moving forward\nAnd for the United states and our us southern border and this is extraordinarily dangerous and a big problem for us because some of the people within these groups are not just regular farm workers are people for villages\nThat are hard working people um there are good people in these groups I think they've been used and they're being used by these coordinators but there are some as Thirteen gang members there is some pretty bad guys and these groups to\nUm we know that from seeing their tattoos from talking to them while I was down on the border I'm definitely gang affiliated people\nSo we're we're not what we're seeing here is people being abused and use by\nThese organizers by these governments\nAnd I am telling you there are people within the ... I'm Honduran government socialist political activists political groups that are helping with this coordination and they're presenting a huge problem or not just for for for our country but for their own people as they make their way down here I Know there's more ways that people\nReady to move forward because remember once they get this thing started once the ball yeah ...\nThere's no way to stop it it's a snowball effect and people will just all of Eric ... going to let us into a country and they coached them my coach them a credible fear\nCredible here this is what you just said when you get to the border this is how you say in America\nAnd it's just a it's just a game I mean it's as you say a few lines and then you released to the piece of paper\nAnd a judge has try and hold women and children separately you can't keep it keep them longer than twenty days and then they're off to the races and it's and it's pretty much over and I think a lot of these democratic socialist organizations in the United states know that once they get into the country\nThose new you know temporary you know migrants or whatever the the provisional status they get\nThey'll feel like a a debt of gratitude to the left and be ...

Democrats if they ever get amnesty that's what they want then there's a demographic shift in the country that his ear retrieval both for Republicans in irreversible because of the sheer numbers\nYet a great point I mean which is the reason we've seen some of those reports coming out of California and other parts of the country where we've seen that illegals have voted right\nUh and and there's a shift and there's a shift and if they become citizens of course there was another shift a one of the interesting things I spoke with a somebody from immigration and Customs Enforcement of the United states and part of what they're seeing is is that for example men will take young girls\nYou know the ... the the under Eighteen or children and the women will take the boys because once they reach the border and if the you know as as a mother says well I don't have the father they can't really separate the child from the mother so that they just release them into the U.S with a return to court date\nSo we're seeing the catch and release still ongoing\nOr we have men who have little girls they know they can't\nThem in a holding facility with other men because they've got a a child they kept separate them so they release them so we're still seeing the same problems that we've seen for years\nHappening right now and the president you know President Trump is very adamant about the fact like look you guys can't control your borders work in a pool aid or the ... the complexity here is that okay we understand that but our borders are being overrun too\nSo I think the most important thing we can do for\nThe United states where the Guatemalan government even with in Honduras right now for the hunter and government that's working against some of the socialist a\nA aspects of their of their country a political an apparatus is to actually find out who is funding this is any us money from us aid going to find these groups\nThat are coordinating these efforts than we really need to start pulling the funding and we really need to hold people accountable because what we have is a caravan of people ... as well with children and women although those numbers are a lot smaller uh from what I've seen than the men that are coming across and saying\nWe're going to charge you were going to find a way to stop this we're going to pull that funding from\nFrom USAID a groups that are that are actually assisting and there's a caravan and we're going to hold people responsible for the people that guy along this track because believe me young women are being raped\nA there is a lot of concern with ... with children are being uh exposed to this type of a friend who is caravan this walk be put on the back of card so people should actually be charged for this and held accountable if they're not\nThat are that are actually assisting and that's a caravan and we're going to hold people responsible for the people that guy along this track because believe me young women are being raped\nA there is a lot of concern with ... with children are being uh exposed to this type of a red us care of this walk put on the back of card so people should actually be charged for this and held accountable if they're not", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cave Creek", "day": "23"}
