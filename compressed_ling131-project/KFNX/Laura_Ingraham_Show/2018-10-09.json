September seventeenth during the cabinet crush\nThe Trump Administration is designing a plan presented by UN ambassador Nikki Haley for President Trump to hold a meeting at the un that was next week a couple of weeks ago focused on Iran according to diplomats familiar with the meeting Haley had announced that Trump\nWould share a meeting on the world's biggest diplomatic stage quote to address Iran's violations of international law in general instability Iran so throughout the entire Middle East region\nFocusing the meeting on Iran drew immediate concerns from us allies to believe that the topic would expose sharp disagreements among the U.S Britain and France\nOver the twenty Fifteen Iran nuclear deal which Trump unilaterally withdrew from the may other U.S officials also voiced concerns that an article of UN Charter would allow Iran to participate in the meeting because it's quote a party to the to the dispute under consideration\nRaising the prospect of an awkward in contentious stand up between Trump\nAnd representative of Iran\nSeems like the Trump Administration was right about this one stay there [noise]\nNews you won't get anywhere else independent talk eleven hundred gay of acts fair and bell and independent duck eleven hundred K.

I've never like Taylor Swift music you know what I really don't like is it Taylor Swift ruined watch ill Rhode Island where I used to go as a kid\nShe took on an old home that was up on this a bluff that was just an old colonial home it was it was largely in when I was a kid it look giant and of course she tricked it all out she has these these guards standing on the rocks\nAll around her her state looking down on the public beach and they and you if you even so much just put a pinkie toll on the rock the guard start taught you know start telling you to get your foot off the rock you know what I I Know what I said to one of them I said this was a couple of years ago now I said\nShe really paying you that much money that you stand out here all day long\n[noise] I don't even have missed it yesterday\nI've never like Taylor Swift music you know what I really don't like is it Taylor Swift ruined watch old Rhode Island where I used to go as a kid\nShe took on an old home that was up on this a bluff that was just an old colonial home it was it was largely in when I was a kid it look giant and of course she tricked it all out she has these these guards standing on the rocks\nAll around her her state looking down on the public beach and they and you if you even so much just put a pinky toe on the rock the guard start taught you know start telling you to get your foot off the rock you know what I I Know what I said to one of them I said this was a couple of years ago now I said\nShe really paying you that much money that you stand out here all day long and tell these the beachgoers who are just trying to go with their family that the little boy or girl can't climb on the rock really\nAnd the guard just seemed really miserable by the way I was just gonna say she endorsed Phil Bredesen which I Hope I I guess she hasn't heard that Phil ... said that he would have voted for cash for Kavanaugh so what are you talking about\n[noise]\nAnd uh when you're when you're most famous song is called shake it off okay then you really that's all you need to know about Taylor Swift I mean she's incredible marketing\nGenius and [noise] I think she just made a um [noise] cheeseburger or something like ...\nShe's so tall\nBut I mean this is what Katy Perry\nThought she was going to do and all they all thought they were going to Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen and all these people with a lot more talent Taylor Swift thought they were going to make a difference bond oh and\nAll Miley Cyrus though yeah and then people vote for you know their pocketbooks and rule of law safety security\nThat's all right Taylor has her own contingent of security surely doesn't need the ice agents or police or anything like that [noise]\n... it's an interesting move and I don't I don't I don't get it I I I studied this for a long time when I was doing love blood with Dr Drew\nAll those years and drew you to tell me you know sort of the feminine way is the better way like the more you ball\nAnd I kept saying no I have kids they need us they need to bother and they they need the mother and we offered to you\nIt's an interesting move and I don't I don't I don't get it I I I studied this for a long time when I was doing love lined with Dr Drew\nAll those years and drew you to tell me you know sort of the feminine way is the better way like the more you ball and\nKept saying no I have kids they need us they needed a father and they they need a mother and we offer to different things part of the\nPlan is to turn men and women into the same unit this is all kind of part of the bigger\nPush for gender sort of a conformity\nWell I think again the more successful Trump is\nOn the economy and foreign policy are getting all these judges on the court or any of the good things that have been happening consumer confidence the more successful Trump is the angrier\nAnd more possessed a less become since so whether it's the toxic masculinity or whether it's you know chaining themselves to the White House doors are ... they they seem to be truly upset that things are going well in the country\n\nWell it's interesting I mean you know it it it's in saying oh well there's a couple of things that are funny\nMy wife works where the progressive woman and at some point I don't know Bill Maher name came up and\nMaybe he was going to retire or something like that and she has now wait a minute he's like the only one on our side and I thought Yeah Bill Maher and everyone on late night and all that news outlet and MSNBC and CNN\nIt's it's weird that hey it's it's funny to have simultaneously almost everyone in the news you and Hannity and Tucker in a handful of other people excluded or the exception but\nAlmost everyone's on your side and you're claiming we have no voices on our side it's interesting and then also here's how effective\nIt is I work with a lot of young people and I don't mean young\nTwenty five I mean you know thirty five and ... one one of the guys who works with me who's an intelligent enough guy\nSays to me yesterday as it pertains to Kavanaugh he goes look I don't\nGet it why don't we just why didn't they just get rid of him and get another guy in there get rid of the guy who has all the baggage on all the past it just get a guy in there with a you know a clean record and move forward I don't understand why they didn't do that like\nYou don't understand why they couldn't do that you know what do you mean all the baggage all the stuff that got hooked up in the eleventh hour all the stuff that wasn't substantiate it all and said allegations from high school they're going through in your book I said what do you think they would do to the next guy but he literally thought\nWell just get a new guy in there and then he'll get a fair shake every one move forward\nI think that any other president would have probably drop Kavanaugh um\nOther animals I think of the guys who ran against Trump in the twenty Eighteen twenty sixteen primary\nWhy didn't they just get rid of him and get another guy in there get rid of the guy who has all the baggage on all the past and just get a guy in there with a you know a clean record and move forward I don't understand why they didn't do that as like\nYou don't understand why they couldn't do that you know what do you mean all the baggage all the stuff that got hooked up in the eleventh hour all the stuff that wasn't substantiate it all and said allegations from high school there there was your book I said what do you think that we're due to the next guy but he literally thought\nWell just got a new guy in there and then he'll get a fair shake everyone move forward\nI think that any other president would have probably drop Kavanaugh um\nAny other animals I think of other guys who ran against Trump in the twenty Eighteen twenty sixteen primary\nHow many of them would have stuck it out and fought for this nomination I don't think a lot of Trump knew that this was something you could not backed down from he wasn't going to apologize and I think Adam though and we really find out what really happened here it's going to be a lot more sinister than we know right now with the with these accusations that came forward\nWell I agree with that but this is just your average citizen who is a good guy who just watches\nCNN and MSNBC NBC and that's where he gets his information and he legitimately wants to know what's what's wrong with capital mhm and that's to me\nWhere the real battle is this isn't a bad guy and he's not even a particularly political guy he just watches\nNBC and MSNBC and CNN and he gets all\nThe information and it's all going through the filter and so ... what choice but draw these conclusions she could no you couldn't draw any other conclusions you wouldn't either that's the only place you got your news\nYeah man you didn't have parents or anyone else kind of guiding you to the right at least an objective kind of understanding okay this this is Kevin honest opinion zero three hundred he was a Bush guy was in the Bush White House for you know seven years\nWas Justice Kennedy's Locklear commend is not some fire breathing person going to burn down to the Supreme Court's got but you're right that that's not what they're interested in they're interested in dominating the discussion Adam to the point that people are afraid to speak out and now those images and those video clips\nOf people like Susan Collins been cornered with her back against the law and the elevator\nI I mean I think they would have called walk through that crowd on Saturday I don't know if she would have survived it\nFrankly\nYou know it's interesting because I grew up around it I grew up in the seventies I had a kind of a hippie ...\nAnd it's so funny because when you think of ... hippie or progressive no one says hippie anymore but sort of progressive\nSort of tree hugger piece lover I'm going to take my daisy and I'm going to put it in a barrel of the garden of the national guardsmen just but nice that been near is rage\nIt's so funny it's almost an ethic patient to hide the rage the hippies were some of the most angry people I've ever met when I was a kid I figured this one out my mom was kind of a hippie but she was also kind of rage fall\nAnd I think it's a compensation for the anger that's in them you know\nA picture a Rosie O'Donnell remember the old Rosie odonnell with the ... to ... to to each of club member her TV show from the nineties was there ever a more ... sweet character ever she's up\nNo one says hippie anymore but sort of progressive sort of tree hugger\nPiece lover I'm going to take my daisy and I'm going to put it in a barrel of the garden\nOf the national guardsmen just but nice that been near is rage\nIt's so funny it's almost an application to hide the rage the hippies were some of the most angry people I've ever met when I was a kid I figured this one out\nMy mom was kind of a hippie but she was also kind of rage fall and I think it's a compensation for the anger that's in them\nA picture a Rosie O'Donnell remember the old Rosie odonnell with the ... to ... to to each of club member her daily TV show from the nineties was there ever a more ... sweet character ever she's up there to big fluffy sweaters that she's laughing at that was\nOver compensation for the rage full Rosie O'Donnell and I think all the free to be you and me tree hugging\nA three lovers I think there's rage and it's funny because they've always painted the right as the angry war mongers corps so Rachel but look at all the rage on the left\nWell there there again their anger is completely\nDisconnected from the overall mood of the country so as long as long I mean literally said Hillary in there and we had seven percent unemployment and interest rates were going up and\nWe were in Syria and I'm more military ... ... ... more military in Syria Adam ... that'd be fine as long as they're there are social construct as being foisted upon the American public so their their their happiness political happiness exists only as America is being transformed in their direction\nYes it's true it's it's a kind of adolescent approach to life if you're in your room and you have your toys\nWho cares if the whole neighborhood is crumbling as long as you're occupied with what you what are your watching what you want to continue be sort of a ... with immediate gratification so yes it's true listen I live in Los Angeles I I I get it\nThe ice you have to step over piles of homeless people were going to have a a typist epidemic coming any day now because uh the homeless people are getting the fleas from the rats\nI mean it is it started with your more here but as long as uh the folks in power keep their power uh they're they're happy now their rage roll again against Trump don't get me wrong but we have I live in one of the worst runs cities in the in the country\nYeah well again [laughter] Adam Pearl is with us here on the ... I have to play something for your number and then we'll let you close it out and and this was Hillary or the interview about you know the state of things in America today let's listen\nTo not be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that ... I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the ...\nThat's when the village he can start a dance\nAt him\nYou know these are the people who kick you in the share and and then you push 'em in the shoulder and they go why did you push me\nIs if it's on I mean\nDo feel and it kinda makes you feel like you're taking crazy pills right mhm and\nAlso basically what she's saying is what you just said which is as soon as we get our way and will stop during a tantrum\nLet you close it out and this was Hillary are being interviewed about you know the state of things in America today let's listen\nWe cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house hand or the planet\nThat went to ... start again\nAdam\n... you know these are the people who kick you in the shade and and then you push 'em in the shoulder and they go why did you push\nIt if it's on I mean\nI Do feel it kinda makes you feel like you're taking crazy pills right mhm and\nAlso basically what she's saying is what you just said which is as soon as we get our way and will stop during a tantrum and the civility we'll we'll set in\nA also this notion I I I I have to go on a quick rate here this notion of I Would like to destroy the environment so that my kids live underground for their adult lives like I hate women or even though I have a daughter in a in a wide I\nHate people that look different than me or I hate gay people it is one of the most insulting people never really think about how in Seoul thing it is I mean it's wrong but calling everyone or racist and everyone massages everyone homophobic and the republic", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cave Creek", "day": "09"}
