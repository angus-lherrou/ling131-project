any country that does not have\nA little bit more of them will fail [noise]\nThe Democrats don't want Donald Trump talked about immigration [noise] the the Gallup polling on that the the way most people view this when questions are asked with specific [noise] do you think that people who come to this country who are have no legal status\nHere should be able to secure a passport for a child born here [noise]\nThat polling on that if they if if the polling companies wanted to really find out the way people\nFelt on these types of issues you have to ask questions with real specificity because again most people are busy with their lives they don't really know what this means birthright citizenship but then when people find out about it because Trump talked about it like what four hundred thousand\nPeople are born in the United states to illegal immigrants every year and it costs four point three billion dollars in taxpayer dollars to educate them and to give other federal benefits healthcare and so forth people are just like what\nI think it's outrageous most people\nIncluding in one of the most hotly contested Senate races in the United states which is in the

lower\nUh Matt this is a Montana obviously is a massive state it's a lot of ground to cover so you have to you have to pick your pick your places where you go but it would seem to me that the way the\nAmerican media have attempted to demonize Donald Trump just on the in the last a week or so with these horrible attacks and and on the issue of immigration I don't see Montana and buying that demonization and trying to connect you with that I really don't\n\nThey just and I'm very proud to stand with the president his policies lore we've had him out here three times\nAnd the president will be coming to Bozeman again this Saturday at twelve thirty or to join us again for yet another rally and I and I'm thrilled that he's doing so you know his his policies of\nTax cuts and trying to secure our southern border and reducing regulation and getting these trade agreements in place um has been very very good for the state of Montana and and the people\nEmbrace those policies and they would like to send someone to Washington to help the president accomplished more I mean if we can get this much done\nAnd the last ah twenty months with with a Congress that has not always been cooperative and certainly the Democrats have been as much of a structured is that they possibly can goodness what can we accomplished in the next couple of years\nUh how much in a way of of lobbyists um money has test or taking in during his time in the Senate\n... this is this is one of the things that demonstrate just how for from a Montana Jon Tester is gone he is the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyist in the country\nFive hundred and thirty five members of Congress we have one million people here and he has received more contributions from lobbyists than any other a member over one million dollars over one million dollars and why is that he stood on the stage twelve years ago and said he wouldn't be in ...\nBy special interests and now he's the number one recipient he literally bought a house with a million dollar home to Washington DC and left Montana and his rearview mirror\nWell again Montanans are very smart pragmatic no nonsense people and I think

and persistent\nSplitting opinion on what to do with the Iranian man that's where it Germany today given the fact that Merkel is out as her party a leader she's in her last term are clearly opposition forces in Germany more populist uh anti migration or political on\nLower so far the German government has not changed his position it's still wants to stay inside of the J CPA away\nBut nearly every German company folks with real money at risk and made the opposite decision they have fled they have left they decided they are not going to uh run through the Iranian sanctions that President Trump will put back in place on Monday [noise]\nAnd there are other countries in Europe who are with us um and I am convinced that over time all of the European countries will come to see that Iran is indeed the uh the force creating instability in the middle east and that we must apply all possible pressure to push back against that the fix it\nSo the sanctions going place on Monday correct yes ma'am Monday and they'll feel them immediately or will it take a little time to settle and\nSo are there are already feeling them but um as the days go on the pressure will increase we will substantially dropped the amount of crew do their primary revenue source that they could ship around the world a treasury will put back in place sanctions on financial institutions there\nAnd we hope that the sanctions were put on individuals and in other places\nThe President Trump will put back in place on Monday [noise]\nAnd there are other countries in Europe who are with us um and I'm

walk the Iranian people to uh be successful we want this to be a successful can we want to restore democracy that we we think the Iranian people want that same thing\nAs our aim is or not to hardly renting people but to change the behavior the malign activity of this regime\nAre just going back to Germany a boy had a Merkel's fortunes changed obviously she'll be finishing up her last term but she's been there for Thirteen Years or so\nUh and uh she's leaving ahead of her party well how would that change our dealings with Germany in the in the near term and what do you see as the political climate in Europe with the rise of self ... in the challenges that you'd say thing\nSo we have many places where the Europeans work alongside us we clearly have some were um we don't share the same view the president\nHas been direct with respect to the Europeans taking increased responsibility for their own security that makes perfect sense most European countries understand that the primary folks who need to defend against the risk that Russia crates I'm a reside in Europe not in America [noise]\nAnd so I'm hopeful as each of these governments evaluate system sees that America is with them were happy to assist them but they have the primary responsibility we hope that each of these governments will come to see that in the way that President Trump is so clearly laid out\nOr CNBC reported yesterday Mr Secretary that North Korea is reportedly\nPreparing nuclear and missile sites for international inspectors are what can you tell us about I Know you're going to go meet with you're now North Korean counterpart just a matter of days but what's the latest from ah North Korea\nSo I Can't say much about what's taking place on the ground but I can make clear that when I was

too long it's one of the things I'll speak with my counterpart next week about and then we do have the intention of a President Trump or German Kim getting together before too long hopefully early in

related intellectual property this is a story that's been going on for years this is the first administration that has been prepared to push back against China\nI were doing so on all fronts so where the semi conductor piece fits in with it it's part of a mosaic of our strategic effort to push back against this continue Chinese effort [noise]\nAh you know it begins with trade we want president has demanded fair reciprocal trade with China we've demanded that they not steal our intellectual property\nWe talk with some frequency about the enormous violation of religious freedom a that's taking

of billions of dollars across the country millions and billions in in my district so it's difficult because uh I I Am not very wealthy man my opponent\nA is a healthy person and he came here you've only been in California about six or seven years here are they from his dad came out of your\nWhile I don't have the money that I spent on the campaigns are here to real challenge for clothes to wear clothes that are actually having no money left but we have raised over two million dollars to hire opponents four and a half million dollars not to mention the Bloomberg\nType money that's coming into the into the race\nThat the press is calling this a forty eighth district race in California a referendum on Trump and the Trump agenda what is your take on it\n[noise] I think that it you know that's one element of the race certainly a a I think though that I've been a supporter of the president on things like illegal immigration\nI differ with the president once or twice as well on on on major issues but most things like that on the president's I and I admire the president and the good job but he's been doing so that is an issue here however the the most important thing is\nIs that my opponent she ... she got a choice to be more open another person how the Democratic candidates are ...\nAnd she or he basically does he's a newcomer to the area and he doesn't understand any of the things that go to the heart of what it's like to be a piece of this uh this county this part of the country\nAnd I mean I grew up surfing along the beaches here and a better I I went to high school here and at college here have a ... so what it is is that if\nThe president is an issue but we've got an outsider in this district was trying to a game right to represent us ... guy on the\nIs legal part parks really\nWell there you know obviously the ... year the is a is quite a trophy if the Democrats can defeat you are you been in Fifteen terms\nI you came in as a strong Reagan a conservative or libertarian leaning and are you now are in that fight with someone who's getting an enormous amount of outside money\nWho's challenging the entire world view of a Trump and conservatism as Orange County itself had seen an influx of a folks from last\nThere have been to Europe so what it is that if the president is an issue\nWe've got an outsider in this district was trying to a game [laughter] to represent us on me as being part art and really\nYeah well there you know obviously the your seat is is quite a trophy if the Democrats can defeat you\nAre you been in for Fifteen terms\nI you came in as a strong Reagan a conservative or libertarian leaning and are you now are in that fight with someone who's getting an enormous amount of outside money\nWho's challenging the entire world view of a Trump and conservatism as Orange County itself at seeing an influx of ah folks from Los Angeles\nAnd more liberal enclaves of the state of California uh so what do you say to my listeners a congressman or our back or about what California has done wrong that could end up transplanting itself across the United states extending across the United states\n[noise] well ... part of our on our big problem in California and of course uh it's it's about having a major impact as I say on our quality of life you have to look at things and and how pervasive this whole issue of vision of having\nMillions of of non citizens are coming here illegally into hearts into our society are right in our education system is going as good as it gets bigger disaster for education system but we hope issues that people talk about like how about\nHomeless and when you take a look close looks at what that means is there are a lot of people out our state for example who are down in their White House to homeless people you guys have drug and alcohol problems but there are probably Harold for the people\nWere homeless who are people who go on for ... ... they lost their job or something and the ... a housing that that they can afford that they that they have the money to be able to pay the rent well that's because\nFor the last Fifteen Twenty years what's happened is\nAll the political ... the low low price housing that would be available website crate house but it's clean and nice living it has been pick it up by people here illegally and they they'll be two or three families\nSo here we have so much of our of our problems bill directly from the fact that the federal government isn't controlling the border\nAnd as I say here\nI think when people think about it I think historically if he was successful I Hope you will be this person what worked on a critical service and turn around the country\nBy herself to it and I want to play thing really quickly for you this is from your a primary I think this is from the primary debate with Iraq current your your opponent Harley ... or less less than\nSuccessful I Hope you will this person was critical and ... hooked\nUp to
