and absurd immigration\nLoopholes that essentially results and catch and release which is what the president it's so frustrated about uh Brian I have to play for you something that Stacey Abrams\nIs a beating on pretty hard which is the claim of voter suppression despite the large voter registration record levels of voter registration in the state uh which of course can play both ways but ah we're going to play this and get your reaction let's listen\nYou know sixty three thousand people who are being forced to go through a necessary hurdles to prove their bona fide eat but the second is that you have a hundred and fifty nine county\nThousands of volunteering paid poll workers who are going to the act to substantially verify that these ideas are sufficient and the challenges there is this

your response\nWell no this was ... law but I Am following state law that we have in Georgia for a vacation process because we believe that we should do not support this that we should clarify\nWho individuals are before we register to vote that's why we have a stick or a citizenship check this flight we have when you get your driver's license in our state her this is a manufactured crisis they did the same thing before the two thousand fourteen reelection of governor Nathan Deal like this\nAnd uh your reaction to that ah the the law that matching matching from a licenses driver's licenses to voter rolls\nThey claim that us secretary of state are disenfranchising or suppressing the ability of especially minorities to vote in the state your response\nWell none of this ... law but I Am following state law that we have in Georgia for clarification process because we believe in we should do not support this that we should clarify\nWho individuals are before we registered to vote that's why we have a stick or a citizenship check this flight we have when you get your driver's license in our state\n... this is a manufactured crisis they did the same thing before the two thousand

elected in Georgia most votes ever cast in our state so I don't see how that spoke suppression\nRight before this outrageous claims came we announced that we had or people on our voter rolls than ever before and the state of Georgia\nWe have things like online voter registration I pushed the general assembly and implemented a secretary of state ... years ago we have eight thousand more people on our roles now than when we hit had when I\nTook office she voted against on line voter registration she does not support our common sense ... the law she voted against our citizenship to\nThe counties are the ones that are flagging these individuals because the information from hurt local groups is not properly filled out on the form and by the way all these people have to do to be able to vote is the same thing that I Would or any other Georgia citizen that his own our roles they just have to go to their polling location\nShow their photo out the most likely their driver's license and they can vote so that is not a high hurdle for people to do but\nCan't blame me on their own canvassers can't fill out proper paperwork register someone wrote and\nIf they use their own lines system they never had any of this problem\nTo start with so she's blaming me for a problem she created a and she's blaming me for following state law and that's why I think Georgia voters are a lot smarter than she gives them credit for they're going to see the smoke screen this all they're doing this to dry out their base out but it's working in reverse cause the Republican base that conservative base\nAnd hard

message in a big way is not been the defining issue of the mid term elections and so there is this and you see it with hard liners as a sort of regular feature American politics now that they feel like they were more outrageous we do something that's just more offensive or controversial maybe that will create a right\nOr because he really is in touch with people on immigration\nRight it's not a big issue [noise] let me give you some facts here before we get to our guests are the Gallup\nPoll the latest a big poll on the top issue for us voters was\nBack in July or twenty two percent of Americans in July said immigration is the top problem for the United states is up from fourteen percent in June and has the highest percentage naming at issue in Gallup history\nAnd asking the most important or when they asked the most important problem question uh again mentioned immigration as the nation's most important problem have averaged only you know five percent of the last Seventeen years the Gallup it's an asking the question on generally a monthly basis\nImmigration is the top issue in the United states slightly edging out the economy okay\nAnd it goes on and on about this uh a Reuters poll found that Fifteen Percent of registered voters said said immigration is their biggest concern topping economic performance and health care\nAnd the writers it's so what's the top issue for voters in the election\nOr that number is higher of course among Republicans with twenty six percent of the G O P voters citing immigration as their major concern just seven percent of Democrats said the same uh but listen to this forty five percent of black voters\nForty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community\nNow why is that the CBS Hugo poll why is that because of course they live in the areas where immigration has a profound effect on the public schools the healthcare system\nOr in some cases crime a housing the list goes on and on these are the facts Donald Trump is more in touch with the American people on immigration than pretty much any politician alive today\nBirth higher of course among Republicans with twenty six percent of the G O P voters citing immigration as their major concern just seven percent of Democrats said the same\nUh but listen to this forty five percent of black voters\nAnd forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community\nNow why is that the CBS Hugo poll why is that because of course they live in the areas where immigration has a profound effect on the public schools the healthcare system\nOr in some cases crime a housing the list goes on and on these are the facts Donald Trump is more in touch with the American people on immigration then pretty much any politician alive today he understands it joining us\nNow I'm delighted or he is with US Congressman Tom Garrett Republican from Virginia fifth congressional district or he's going to give us a the latest because he sits on the all important House Homeland Security Committee as we see these caravans up and running again\nWith the mass migration from Central America coming into this country because they know there'll be caught in alternately released\nCongress men I can tell you my listeners are infuriated by this they want Congress to act they want these loopholes closed what can you tell us about what Congress could do in short order to prevent this nonsense off from continuing\nWell every time we passed the bill or something massive funding stopgap measure will yank their workout already depressed and who wants to keep its promises of securing the border your lead and bumper\nWhere the gentleman that I use that term loosely talked about hardliners on immigration is symptomatic of the fact that the left as co opted the lexicon\nChanged the meaning of words and I'd like for something to do explain to me when defending your national borders and sovereignty became a hard line stance because essentially what they've done is that if you don't want to open borders than you or me\nAnd the American voting public needs to think hard enough to understand that very ridiculous underlying assumptions that I Am all for a robust and help the legal\nImmigration system is I think you are but at what point did securing the border has become controversial and and and and why is it that Republicans cut the rug out from underneath the president as it relates to keep his promises on security our borders I Can't figure it out\nUm and and that well let me tell you about something that happened Congress man this is very concerning again to my listeners and viewers on Fox\nAh this was a earlier this year when we had\nThe opportunity terrain and these ever broadening asylum categories meaning domestic abuse and fear of gangs or what have been included in the credible fear\nA categories as as affecting social groups in a particular country so a bad effect on certain social groups Jeff Sessions comes along as attorney general and says\n... no no no no no a domestic domestic abuse and gang membership that's that's not part of what constitutes credible fear\nCongress sadly David Yoder a congressman from Kansas an a or his demo a democratic ah in ah North Carolina both acted to remove that\nFrom the ongoing congressional action on that so that was gutted by Congress that's the kind of thing that is going to make it more difficult to hold the house of representatives for Republicans it's it's insane that they took they they've decided to God what a Jeff Sessions wanted to do their\nLook Kevin Yoder\nA categories as as affecting social groups in a particular country so a bad effect on certain social groups Jeff Sessions comes along as attorney general and says ... no no no no no a domestic domestic abuse and gang membership that's that's not part of what constitutes credible fear\nCongress sadly David Yoder a congressman from Kansas and a a his ... a democratic ah in ah North Carolina both acted to remove that\nFrom the ongoing congressional action on that so that was gutted by Congress that's the kind of thing that is going to make it more difficult to hold the house of representatives Republicans it's it's insane that they took they they've decided to got what Jeff Sessions wanted to do their\nWell look Kevin Yoder and Kansas has got himself in a tough fight and Republicans always thinking moderating on the message that got him elected in the first place is some sort of magical formula for reelection\nI disagree dance with the one who won ya um and and so you find yourself in a terrible catch twenty two nobody's listening right that's a joke [noise] um but I'm I'm a ... if we lose the house and maybe we'll actually get up off our butts during the lame duck session and keep some of the promises we made three or two and a half three years ago\nI got the upside you know\nThat the Republicans might act like Republicans\nWell I think again this is the most important issue for most Americans are who are answering these polls immigration is either number one number two and these caravans come into the country if Republicans lose the house it'll get worse not going to get better it's going to get worse uh but\n... except maybe we'll get some some courage right UC UC leader McCarthy now talking about border security and I'm ... I'm Glad he is but I mean why now I fear that there's a political motivation what you're saying\nWell again I I'm not I'm not understanding really why Paul Ryan it's still in its speaker of the house I think if you're going to retire or they think Paul Ryan is going to turn out the voters and in twenty Eighteen I mean God Bless all around I like um a lot but I you know there's going to turn out to voters the guy who's flying all over the country right now Donald Trump\nAnd Congress I'm telling you\nCongress is going to rue the day that that didn't get the money for this law they did an appropriate it and they didn't change\nThe stupid asylum laws that allow people to be gaming the system and then caught and ultimately released because we do not have the facilities to house them seven hundred thousand people and immigration backlog now ... court backlog claiming credible fear another client that's absurd\nWell a lot of prosecuting for the better part of a decade and domestic violence as a scourge on any nation but it's hard to prove domestically it's it's real hard to prove ... it's real Salvador oh that is why they're saying or fear alien abduction but that doesn't mean that it's actually happening\nWell again I think that's you and you seemed ... you understand this congressman Garrett but the American people or you know like we we got cities with with the homeless a village in Tempe villages we got a veteran veterans on the street we have people who never were able to get back on their feet after the great recession or our opioid addicted\nWe need help for those people we cannot we cannot be the saviors of the entire world we can do are bad but\nAt some point we got to say you know we're here to focus on the American people and I hope that\nYou take this message back to your colleagues in Congress because I'm telling you people are ... are are a light with if with rage about the situation a congressman thank you so much for joining us would definitely do on TV tone will take a break a lot more to get too including an outspoken advocate\nUh against affirmative action\nBut ... yeah well again I think that's you and you seemed ... you understand this congressman Garrett but the American people or you know like we got we got city is with with the homeless a village is ten villages we got a bitter veterans on the street we have people who never were able to get back on their feet after the great recession or our opioid addicted\nWe need help for those people we cannot we cannot be the saviors of the entire world we can do are bad but\nAt some point we got to say you know we're here to focus on the American people and I hope that\nYou take this message back to your colleagues in Congress because I'm telling you people are ... are are a light with if with rage about the situation a congressman thank you so much for joining us would definitely do on TV too and we'll take a break a lot more to get too including an outspoken advocate\nUh against affirmative action don't\nReceived billions in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money\nAnd using it to discriminate against you\nWell how am I so they take all this money they have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be you know swimming and money uh but this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism a title racism\nOr you know uh affirmative in a more but it's it's not just Harvard more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination in the Supreme Court's Fisher decision or you know\nAffirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored racism um and it it she has a huge impact on admissions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the belief that diversity is the founding principal of America or is I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities pulled the students\nMost would would cite diversity as the founding American principle of course America's founded on liberty\nNot founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that's sacrosanct the colleges always\nList that as a compelling interest and there are a lot in their defense of these lawsuits are that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but it can't be a Supreme Court and the Michigan affirmative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right\nBut you know I I kind of this is the point I Want to one of the points I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got into medical school and dropped out UCLA is a school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and\nI learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans as whites without practicing racial discrimination is missions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great quality of education you can have a great education just let people in\nBased on merit because there are smart people\nOf all races religions colors and creates\nWell the uh the opposition um to your point of view and say that you know you're merely your your goals would merely penalize those who have been systematically subjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states\nOdd vast we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that it is fair then because historically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nOr I Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics and Native Americans on my dad\nCan't compete ah based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a fair playing field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and uh the University of Michigan and other schools across this country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well this genie park who's Harvard Asian American alliance president was on MSNBC and made this point\nI'm laughing is not about protecting American wrought by an anti civil rights act a man named ... rights activist who was trying to bring down Mary and civil rights protections in American society town\nAnd ultimately about his goal to bring down and says the mountainous and that is actually designed to increase the on an angry and opportunity\nCan't compete a based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a fair playing field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and uh the University of Michigan and other schools across the country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well ah this genie park who's Harvard Asian American alliance president ah with on MSNBC and made this point\nThat Washington is not about protecting Asian American in ... by\nAn anti civil rights act a man named Abu ... white rights activists who has been trying to bring down Mary and civil rights protections in American society town then O'Malley about his goal to bring down the ... mission that is actually designed to increase fairness\nIncrease opportunities increase there aren't the make education\nBetter for everyone which is good for Asian Americans while uh your response to that\n[noise] ah affirmative action is racial discrimination against Asian Americans all of the statistical evidence shows that it is much harder to get into college in graduate school as an Asian American for every student who graduated from Harvard costs like her who is a harsh shoot at Harvard\nOr who was an Asian American there was an equally qualified Asian American student somewhere in America\nWho got rejected because of the schools racially discriminatory affirmative action policies those Spiegel spoke at the Asian American coalition offer education's Raleigh a just a couple of days ago so they're speaking for the few who got in ... there was a massive number\nWho are victims of racial discrimination from schools like Hartford\nHow do you think this is going to turn out this court decision I mean you can never guess depends on the judge you get depends on a lot of different factors but how do you think this is going to come down ah\nIt it it comes down to a ... it it comes down to ... for the first time in our nation's history we have an anti affirmative action majority in the Supreme Court\nAh we have a Justice Department who was on our side who sees this as racism or a President Trump has been our greatest ally in our fight to end racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites in the form of affirmative action\nOr so because we have this powerful law alive who is a champion for equal access to education for Asian Americans and white people uh I think that India and we may prevail\nOr going to be that this is probably going to go on for some time on the federal district court level than to a court of appeals and ah if they determine a circuit split on this to the Supreme Court\nUm VJ this is fascinating ah we've got to get you on TV you gotta come on TV with us soon or VJ in them or his book almost black the true story of how I got into medical school by pretending to be black\nOr what do you think about this see it's racial been counting and the words of some it's\nContrary to what we hope that we would achieve a colorblind society a and does it
