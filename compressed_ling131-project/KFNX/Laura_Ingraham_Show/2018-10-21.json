I remember it was an August and I'm thinking it was two thousand\nWhat's happening in Washington or Phoenix or wherever it may be instead of focusing on living our lives and taking care of the people the institutions that are important to us I think that a lot of it just becomes somewhat wasted energy and one of the reasons I think that understanding how the financial world works is\nIt gives you the ability to build an income to build wealth for yourself or your family your church synagogue jump or whatever it may be\nBut you can do that without having to get caught up in all of the the viciousness\nThat has become the system but I Do want to talk a little bit of politics today simply because it it how it's going to I think potentially affect the market and could potentially affect the market in a very great way I'm going to take a step back\nTo ... I remember it was an August and I'm thinking it was two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on and talking about how people were losing trust in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was the only two groups\nIn and this was before ... and by the way I remember that part of it or whatever that you know a few months before that so they re\nWhat they're only two institutions that more than half the people in this country had faith in one of which was the military at Seventy some present\nAnd you can they say well then that means act so that means y understand all that\nBut real lined the total lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and it will have consequences for the market and as I mentioned\nI have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people are predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings\nAnd it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious\nAnd just 'cause I got cut off a little bit in the first segment therefore the classroom and to be teaching is before the crash and the idea of this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is before the market goes down you got to know what you're going to\nTrump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people are predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings\nAnd it's going to be two years every bit as brutal

the idea of this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is before\nThe market goes down you got to know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up but\nThe average retail trade or will never make money and the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I've given us a lot of thought to about you know people keep coming in and telling me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors will define investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realize that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble they put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong\nAnd again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay the problem is is that when the market turned down a can turn down very quickly\nIf you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of game think about this from it Thirteen\nYears of games in a year and a half okay if you lost Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now\nHow is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down then you can on the move up so getting classroom and talk about all these ideas we're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people focus on what's called technical analysis they're using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked winter like four okay you know you have your ... your art and science ... sticks in your are your uh see the eyes and ears and all the thousands or hundreds of these things right\nSo how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got they won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kinda figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecast is really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing\nThanks and you're only looking at averages ... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got they won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kinda figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecast is really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now\nAnd the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes and that's a lot of this is that people used something because it's the best they think they've got but\nIt's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market is supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make there's a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but we always make sure that when we wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing\nAs opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do so

brand\nBecause what you've just lived through a judge Kavanaugh you're going to live through a Donald Trump for the next two years because it will be two years of hearings and it will be brutal and it will be bloody and it will\nIt it is not going to inspire confidence market's dropped thrive on confidence it also means that his ability to continue to cut taxes and regulation again you may think those are bad things but those things have helped the market\nWe have to realize that all of that is at risk of changing pretty quickly so that the class something it'd be teaching and and by the way it totally aside from that\nThere's some other things out there right now to indicate that the market may well be near the top\nReally getting into to those ideas and just a couple of minutes but the to me the key is you have to know what to do before things go bad if you wait till they go bad happens way too fast and you can't react and time\nYou've got to be position before it happens now when the markets falls I mentioned the market when it fell in two thousand eight two thousand nine the market and the S. and P. gave back Thirteen Years of profits in a year and a half\nThat's how fast these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to two thousand level and that was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years and people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon\nMost people's investment horizon and thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years\nAnd you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside that's very very hard than for people to achieve their goals\nSo we're going to be talking about how do we identify the prices would you begin institutions like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at you know when he was buying apple a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five\nThat would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and that will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was by an apple\nWhen the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to two thousand level and that was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years and people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon most people's investment horizon and thirty five to forty years and\nIf you lose twenty or twenty five years\nAnd you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside that's very very hard than for people to achieve their goals\nSo we're going to be talking about how do we identify the prices would you big institutions like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at you know when he was buying apple it a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five\nThat would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and that will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was fine apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics of how I don't want to actually make money when the stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is that they invest in stocks because they think they're safe stocks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into because their markets only open six and a half hours a day Seventeen and a half hours of every day and forty eight hours of every weekend you cannot protect yourself\nYes you can use options to limit your losses but you're still going to have launches okay\nIf you had homeowner's insurance and it only covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected I think most people would not okay and my dad's the situation people in in the market so again to me this is an incredibly important class and I will I've ... I've taught this class before is always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those will be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThey the world is changed in my opinion from a marketing a RINO manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you could always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at at charts in looking it indicators which are the wrong thing\nThere's a fundamental we'd better approach again that I was teaching class so if you want to come out you can get to free tickets free tablet plus we'll feed you launch\nBe one of the next dozen callers at eighty four forty eight trader that T.

A. as in online training academy two\nThree one nine nine six if you win tickets please registered so we know you're coming that way will have a seat for you have your tablet and your lunch and all will be cool okay\nWhy tourists to this market but let's talk about some science for that may be nearing atop\nFirst thing that was during the wall Street Journal today that of the companies that are going public this year eighty three percent of them are losing money\nNow that is the highest in recorded history anytime they've track that this is the biggest number of it's ever been in his now eclipse what was happening in the year two thousand or eighty one percent of the companies were not profitable\nWhen companies are going public and then the stocks are going up which many of these stocks are where there are these ridiculous evaluation\nThere would've known as unicorn stock these companies that have no profits that are worth a billion dollars or more\nThat is a sign of a bubble and that is a sign that we are closer to the end than we are to the beginning of this Ron\nThere's another story I just read that\nCharles Schwab investors which a classic retail traders are now sitting on less cash than they've been at any time in history so they're becoming quote unquote fully invested well that is a lot of implications what drives the market is supply and demand if you've taken away the demand\nAnd there isn't more money on the sidelines to kind of come in and then\nWhat's going to take the market up to the next level now what's been taking it up is companies buying back their own stock and companies are buying back a record amount of stock this year they've never bought so much and that constrains supply and that could drive this market higher again\nThis is it I don't want to be giving you some big doom and gloom thing this market can keep going higher\nThan the repatriation of all that money coming back from overseas is a huge part of what's driving this market higher now it's a one time deal but some of the people aren't spending the money this year they're going to spend it next year so maybe you got a little bit left in the tank next year but at some point it has to come down\nAnd again we need to be prepared for that before it happens\nWe got to have the fundamental skills to be able to benefit from this happens\nBecause you can actually make more money faster on the downside than the upside but at a minimum we've got to know how to protect what we've got\nSo again the class someone to be teaching on before the crash what do you do and also what we're going to cover is what if he keeps going up what should we be doing there's always a way to make money in this market but we always have to start with risk management again\nBe one

CNBC there's the right side of the trade right side of the trade is brought you buy online training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education All right this week we've been talking about\nThe kind of the state of the market and why I think we're closer to the top than the bottom at this point by a very long way and in fact why you may see a top in this market pretty soon\nYou know early this year I said I thought you'd see the top this year\nAnd we don't we haven't really gone much above where we were in January kind of gone back and forth around there\nYou know I said we could have one more run this year and you could look anything's possible you could even get a bit of a run next year\nBut what's going to keep taking this market higher and in the last segment I told you a little bit about what I see as evidence of the top and the market one is the fact that more companies are going public selling shares initial

and ... and the therapy because atheists and that's where people had some dues or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake cutting let's let's take a look at the bill so when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nSecret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management and let me talk about that with the owner built this thing called

nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power from last year

the right amount of panels with smart energy management and let me talk about that we see on our bills this thing called demand and a lot of people an atheist this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe Thirteen point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power of the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hardest time of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\nThere's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it so the smart energy management the way down the analogy of the people like like that I've been told\nIs remember when we have landlines and the telephone companies said if you use your land line to call long distance Monday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay to a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were known more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist don't matter when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when it's hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number\nTimes that by seven Fifteen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty four cents that demand church is more than the cost of your kill all walk on that if you're a rape plan it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal\nUm I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I say the power companies have a license to steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay younger ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is we know we have to pay it\nTeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty four cents that demand church is more than the cost of your kill all walk on that particular rape plan is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal\nUm I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay younger ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay for a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you any more so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's gonna continue to go off\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house most families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them\nAnd I explain all this to them so not only are you paying between seven and a half and eat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying two words the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um ... it just it doesn't make sense for them they can you give me a raise\nEverybody should just call you just find out how to read their bill and then I don't know how to read they're real and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if you go why didn't I Do the sooner I write so many people who will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site and I do a rate I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing us for a year year\nA half and then today there's out\nGo up they are never going to stop where they're at um ... it just it doesn't make sense for them they can you bring me a raise everybody should just call you just to find out how to read\nTheir bill and then I don't know how to read their ... and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I

learn all of this so\nIf there's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing us for a year year and a half and then today there's out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go home now you understand what she rains and so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car\nAnd gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and pay to fifty and that's essentially Carol I'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS Messer piece rate punch today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home will you between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid the power company\nCut in half and

Blackstone having an ally of light reflecting all the use of the rainbow he took the pebble into the house and put it on the mantle which covered the central fires and then forgot all about it a few days later the same old priest came in to visit Ellie hot feeds successor\nAnd the woman he opened that drawing room door he saw that flash of light on the mantel and he rushed up to it and he shouted

twenty three years a flood of coal oil\nWhich the state geologist of Pennsylvania I declared ten years later was even them worth a hundred million dollars the man who own that territory on which the

'cause everybody has an electric bill everybody has the power bill that we all\nWe are all very frustrated especially this summer I'm seeing so many people that have called me listening tour show

I'm seeing so many people that have called me listening to our show Carol\nI'm and I'm On different radio shows as well and my whole mission is because of my daughter\nFive years ago [noise] um that I

said mom I really need help with my ...\nI said well honey I really can't help you that much with your ... but by the way how much does it\nAnd when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident and I said ... you have a little tiny house how ... how to build these so high\nI said there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and harvest from a PS ... 'cause atheists mentor people had some news or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake cutting let's let's take a look at the bill so when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nWith smart energy management and let me talk about that we see on our built this thing called demand and a lot of people an ape you this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called the man and it's a number of like maybe Thirteen point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hottest I'm of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest coming today oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping\nPoint seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three ten\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hottest I'm of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\n... there's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that too right in them and and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it so the smart energy management the way that the analogy that people like like that I've been told\nIs remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance Monday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay it a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist met her when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when the hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for a home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added on to our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars um it the power that you've consumed at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill all walk on that particular rape plan it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay younger ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it it's a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS ... you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own\nAnd I get very upset about it is\nHere for its criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I say the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay younger ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it it's a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS semester if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you anymore so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's gonna continue to go up\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate from my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them\nAnd I explain all this to them so not only are you paying between seven and a half and eat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying two words the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're listening more comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and [noise] you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um\nIt it just it doesn't make sense for them they built in Ukrainian rates everybody should just call you just find out how to read\nTheir bill and they know how to read they're real and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if he'll go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people will say that on my show all the time it's site\nAnd I do a rate I'm review and break it down\nIt's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I'd say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half\nAnd then today there is out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to click all the time and then they go home now I understand what she rains and so no judgments but at the end of the\nDay we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon and gas\nGreat I'm review and break it down [noise] it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half and then today there is out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go home now you understand what she runs and so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car\nAnd gas over here is five dollars a gallon and gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and pay you fifty and that's essentially Carol\nI'm sending people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS Messer piece rate puns today's rates [noise]\nWhen you added up the average home where you between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid for the power company cut in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money\nWell here's what we're going to do we want to keep out your phone number because everyone really should just give recall she does a free consultation she's ready to do with the better Business Bureau I just found out at that out and uh her phone number direct it is six to three\nEight five zero eight two two nine she wants you to go up on her website it is ask solar Sandy dot com go to ask makes sure at ... dot com\nFill out the kilowatt worksheet and she can help you save money on a bill that you're already paying way too much money on what are your final words for to that you know\nIt it's the simplest is you know I really am on the mission and when I helped my daughter it was the first time in a long time due to my circumstances that I was able to do\nSomething really significant in her life could write financially wasn't able to help her but I saw the really big problem for her and it gave me\nA self accomplishment in it she was so ever so grateful\nThen she shared it with her neighbors and a lot of her neighbors did it because the than I was able to help them understand my daughter was able to help them understand it\nSo now it's about I'm there to educate\nAnd give people the the information so that they can make an informed decision about their own power costs they wouldn't let somebody else choose their host what kind of payment they could afford for mortgage they wouldn't let somebody ... ... how much they could afford for car why would people\nUntil maybe since they just haven't got the information yet but let's get Hugh Hugh with the right information you can make an informed decision about your power\nCause she's valley wide it's no obligation free consultation to you out there she has lots of incentives to that she offers to everyone\nThe number to call her direct it is area code six to three eight five zero eight two two nine go on that website and check out the ... ... it's asked sell solar Sandy dot com [noise]\nLet somebody ... ... how much they could afford for car why would people and maybe they just haven't got the information yeah but let's get Hugh with the right information you can make an informed decision about your power come\nShe valley wide it said no obligation free consultation to you out there she has a lot of incentives to that she offers to everyone\nThe number to call her direct idiots area code six to three eight five zero eight two nine go on that website and check out the ... ... feet it's asked sell solar Fannie dot com\nNo no he's not a saint uh they're doing this for two reasons number one they would like\nDonald Trump to fail one way to do it is by destroying his relationship with the Saudis right one of the things that he did Donald Trump was to bring the Saudis on board in this war against terrorism to align themselves with America is real and fighting Iran those\nWandering toppled a Donald Trump they figure well let's try to destroy his foreign policy number one number two if they can convince us that this is such a terrible thing that we have to\nCancel the deal that we have in supplying what a hundred and twenty billion dollars worth of arm I mean Ryan Saudi Arabia they would like to do that because that would hurt the economy\nSo a lot of this was part of the never Trump thing and then of course if it's a journalist hunger live only America gather right journalist always stick together but he's really not what we would call a a professional journalist you didn't go to the Columbia school of journalism is someone who at one time\nI was very tight with the Saudis but now that the Saudis are getting closer to America willing to work at least behind the scenes but the Israelis he doesn't like that is very anti Israel I hear you might even be anti Jewish too ah he's certainly anti um\nThe Trump Administration find an anti American to address the Washington Post wind that found it very convenient to make him a uh all of a sudden the columnist but he will be color will journal\nHe wasn't a column and now he ... he was he gave an opinion store have opinions stories that's what he submitted every once in a while\nAnd he was not a columnist American you got to remember that when you got to listen to all the propaganda going out by the media even Fox News and I'm like why did they report stuff like that that's not true is because it's the story itself you know since they can sales news and the you know blah blah blah blah blah ... they created a lot of money doing it but here's the deal\nThe Saudis are getting closer to America willing to work at least I understand what the Israelis you know why that is very I tell you it's real area might even be a Jewish too are certainly anti uh the Trump Administration\nBy an anti Americans\nAt the Washington Post toilet found it very convenient to make him a uh all of a sudden the columnist for the last caller will journal\nYeah he wasn't a columnist now he ... he was he gave an opinion store have opinion stories that's what he submitted every once in a while\nAnd he was not a columnist America you got to remember that when you got to listen to all the propaganda going out by the media even Fox News and I'm like why do they report stuff like that that's not true is because it's the story itself you know since ... sales news in a you know blah blah blah blah blah ... they created a lot of money doing it\nBut here's the deal so during the Las Vegas shooting now how does this all tied together let me wrap it up in about a minute Las Vegas shooting we know 'cause I have tape and video\nThat when the FBI during the Las Vegas police department went up into that room where the fella kill themselves who was supposed to be the shooter there was no broken windows zero I had the footage of it not only that\nAh there was helicopters name does at least three eye witness and there was a lot more than that but we have audio of interviews were witnesses said it came from the helicopters matter of fact there was a nine one one call came in and said the shooting is not coming from the hotel it's coming from a helicopter\nIsn't that crazy now but here's the deal the plants at the time was in Las Vegas so\nFrom what we're coming to find out that Las Vegas shooting was an assassination attempt\nOn the prince of Saudi so that's what we're\nThinking that that's where all the evidence is leading to the fascination attempt matter of fact the prince was there\nHe was seen as close when he was leaving the er and when all the shooting going went on they showed him in film and we have this I have this town where he changed clothes from his Saudi garb where he was wearing American type close in shorts and the teacher of course he had some sun glasses on\nHe was surrounded by guess who the FBI and the Las Vegas police department he was getting shuffled through there who was assassination attempt that's what it was it never came from the room but you now what does that have to do with this because they're ... I guarantee you and this is what our report this is why I wanted to have you on the show rabbi because our\nCitizen reporters and by the way we have the White House listening to the show today good for you because it's going to give me some publicity rabbi but [laughter]\nOr not that you need public you have gone on your side but a um\nSo so what this has to do with what's happening over there in Turkey\nIs it the same people you watch is going to come out are citizen reporters going to find this out and it's all going to come to the lie where it all leads back to taking down the Saudis taking them President Trump\nTaking down our relationship and hurting our economy so that he doesn't you know get reelected is this is sound crazy does this sound crazy do you\n\nYou know in this world that's what I say this is a cloak and dagger world uh I find everything very coincidental\nThat right before the midterm elections something like this happens right all these accusations I don't know I haven't spent the amount of time us thinking about it in terms of other incidents certainly not I didn't put Las Vegas together\nI have I citizen reporters that worked for me that's why we're out doing you know we're not doing work that that's why I was ...\nIt's the same people you watch is going to come out are citizen reporters going to find this out and it's all going to come to the line where it all\nLeads back to taking down the Saudis taking them President Trump taking down our relationship in hurting our economy so that he doesn't you know get reelected is this is sound crazy does this sound crazy do you\nYou know in this world that's what I say this is a cloak and dagger world uh I find everything very coincidental\nThat right before the midterm elections something like this happens right or all these accusations but I don't know I haven't spent the amount of time you thinking about it in terms of the other incidents certainly not I didn't put Las Vegas together\nI have I have seen this new reporters that work for me that's why we're out doing you know we're not doing work that's that's why I was\n... and I like he's a columnist as if he was a bit of William F ... or that Jesus Scotty Reston uh basically I imagine the Washington Post hired him to give him a megaphone to give him an outlet to um\nPut pressure on the Trump Administration or to write reports that would question the\nPropriety of the Trump Administration and the Saudi royal family because of the Washington Post listen they are never Trump or his number ... ...\nJust as is the New York times so I don't think he's a columnist they gave him this title but that's why these journalists are all ... excited if it would have just been a businessman that this happened to people would say well that's that's\nToo bad yeah wouldn't become thing about it ...\nRight can smoke canceling that are then arms ... is the only ever I mean it's way bigger than their\nMillions of Americans can lose their job now if you do want to stop something being exported to the Saudis those that export our movies ... television shows\nThat Hollywood [laughter] let's that many ...\nAre you in one at America are you listening to that and all that money that they do back and forth ride that goes to Hollywood can they be in hundreds of millions of dollars right\nEvery time we talk about punishing\nCountry it's on the backs of American workers are American farmers are American coal miners\nIf the on the backs of Hollywood or you know that America is\nNo more television shows to Saudi Arabia or all of these places that's fine or a ... will be affected if there are few actors and directors then there are millions of Americans are are in the in the street with the wind industry right armaments in in
