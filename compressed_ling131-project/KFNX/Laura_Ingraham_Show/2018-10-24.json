obviously I'm In his bid for the Senate ah but where where are we now in trying to\nAnd trying to rebuild the Republican Party in that state Minnesota economy has been doing so well and the Trump era of just two years we've seen a massive uh uptick\nIn the states productivity this is all positive why would people want to vote against them now\n[noise] Willie don't out we had a or Minnesota is turning red across the whole state people are feeling it they're happy with the way the economy is going and I think Tina Mets didn't show up to the debate the other night because she didn't have any answer to this and where she stands on the issue she's so far\nLeft and so extreme and and part of the resistance and obstructing everything good that is happening on the ground\nA and then she's also a for open borders and she wants to Minnesota to be a sanctuary state and she is directly tied to Keith Ellison still continuing to campaign with him\nYet uh being as hypocritical as as they are she's again you know wanting to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh justice cabin on called for another investigation so\nMinnesotans are are some of the most well educated people when they go to the polls we don't have to register Democrat or Republican were free to move without the cabin when we go vote and they do their research and and uh we have some of the ... we have the highest turn out\nIn the country when it comes to voting and so we go educated so it was really disappointing that Tina Smith didn't want to debate may or at least tell the people of Minnesota where she stands on things because she knows that's not what's resonating on the ground\nWell a Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the day before yesterday was warning of a green wave of democratic

me not just me as a candidate I really am not when I'm traveling throughout the state there's a lot of energy the height or the president and and even when he came for the two rallies he's already done to rally this cycle here in Minnesota there is a lot of excitement for my campaign and for the rest of the candidates throughout the state\nOur current housley it is a fantastic to have you on a ... everybody needs to get out there and vote because the woman who was appointed Tina Smith\nOr even worse than Al Franken if you can believe that and she you know she uh obviously you know banks that she'll be able to just snuck or the Minnesotan\nVoters for more liberal policies in open borders forget it ... the last thing the Minnesotans need our politicians in the state\nOr in a a senators representing the state who believe that they need more regulations on the small business owners and more problems for the medical device manufacturers who have done such a great job\nTo ... to

life is leading Americans at the battle in Iraq and bringing them all back home\nYou know one of the things that you look at when you look at things like the Olympics are the only things that are that look the same on us\nOur our uniforms are we are together all American and I don't have a black message or white Misha said last night but a red white and blue message and I I feel like you have um the the progressive Marxist on the left who don't have a message they don't have an identity so we need to use identity politics\nIn order to keep themselves in power I reject that fundamentally on either side far left are far right and I truly believe that by serving all Americans as as equals moving all up together is exactly the type of leadership we need Washington\nWell again the alerts to claim racism\nOr at every turn and claim it's either a combination of ... being a wild or racist or Trump being Hitler which is\nWhich is now it's so disgusting on so many levels and insulting to

race clearly has no idea she has no solutions for America it's all about insult personal insult\nA and attacking the motivations of those with home mom you know she disagrees\nAnd this this is a basic this is absolutely base you know we we learned the amount of the first day of angers class we'd be logical fallacies ad hominem attacks\nBy what you don't have any facts to back up your argument you go to direct directly attacking the individual you go to directly setting up these fallacies because you don't have yourself anything to stand on\nDebbie Stabenow a for her part has been a career politician for forty three years of collecting four million dollars and the taxpayers only gotten five who her co sponsored bills into law in the past Eighteen years and ... remain buildings she writes bipartisanship is a buzzword when she's anything but\nShe's a solid a as a New York senator loaded with Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton Ninety five and Ninety ... some of the time respectively and the promises she's made around ... around Lauren pharmaceutical drug costs around\nTaking care of education and around um funding emergency ah funding for our troops who are deployed\nAnd in our veterans who were coming back home she's broken pumps and so I said her all the time and I would I tell people in the state of Michigan to half is why should we believe this time

in Obama's first two years in office I mean I don't remember Debbie Stabenow standing up for the American worker back then I remember standing up for\nA better trade policies against a China or Mexico and I I don't recall any of that but now because she wants or forty four year year career and politics to continue suddenly she Donald Trump on immigration I don't think so\nShe she is a selective uh ... and ... her positions she has a higher survival like you and she does whatever her polling and Chuck Schumer will tell her\nI'm centers to have it on and you can see our debate on John James for Senate dot com and follow around a but senators now will do is ever convenient\nUm she voted against case law she supports sanctuary cities and uh she will not do anything to secure or she's going up in a position to get comprehensive immigration reform done over her entire period over the past two decades or in in Washington and has failed to lead\nAnd so I Would say this is something we need to get done right now are we need to end illegal immigration\nAnd uh the only way to do that is to get someone who's going to be more than just talk about it but somebody who's going to work with anyone and everyone to get this thing done because this is a matter of uh of economic and national security and it cannot be kicked down the road and one thing I Will guarantee if W standing out gets re
