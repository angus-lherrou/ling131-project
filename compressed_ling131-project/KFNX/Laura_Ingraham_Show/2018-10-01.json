cabinet even though he's a Bush guy\nOr doesn't matter and he's the fifth vote and so by any means necessary judge\n[noise] well um I suppose we could have an interesting conversation about how it came to be that who uh gets appointed came to be so important I mean there's one judge has started um are putting their own gloss on what are actually fairly\nLimited a statement to the constitution that happened a long time ago I mean when when when when justice Douglas found a right to privacy in what he called him a nation's from pa numbers surrounding the other amendments\nI'm quite clear that some people on the court foot that were that they could make it up if they want a long and so then I guess it very much matters who whose head is popping out from beneath the black great [noise]\nWell judge there was a a woman or I've never heard of but she was on MSNBC over the weekend who identifies herself as a Watergate prosecutor just Jill Jill wind banks I literally I've never heard of her but\nThen so be it neither now so she she she know express something that I began ... you're you're beginning to here of course on college camps even her hearing it for years but it's actually entered the mainstream namely the race of Brett Kavanaugh has come into play let's listen\nThere is a white male privilege ravens here\nWhich is I'm In title to this I did the hard work in high school and college and I deserve this I went to yeah that is not the case no one is titled to go on the Supreme Court and no one who has behaved in high school and in college as his alleged to do and no one who performed the waves will do that on Thursday\nDeserves to be even an judge\nYour reaction to that judge\nUm it's [laughter] it's a parody of itself um this got nothing to do with race um I I Can't understand how that gets dragged into it um and the notion that somehow how one\nAppears to be or appeared to be um in high school um determines what one can do in life is I think we're to kill us\nI mean this this is now the new standard apparently but not for liberals conservatives Republicans won't do this to the other side that we had conservative supporting Sotomayor and Kagan you you're not\nGoing to have it play the other way but for Democrats\nYour high school I don't know why why high school and I go back to sixth grade I mean why is just high school the limit here but it it it all reflects on your your character and I find it interesting because they're always about you know letting these\nGets dragged into it um and the notion that somehow how one appears to be or appeared to be um in high school um determines what one can do in life is I think we're to kill us\nI mean this this is now the new standard apparently but not for liberals conservatives Republicans won't do this to the other side that we had conservative supporting Sotomayor and Kagan you you're not going to have it play the other way but for Democrats\nYour high school I don't know why why high school when I go back to sixth grade I mean why is just high school the limit here but it it it all reflects on your your character and I find it interesting because they're always about\nYou know letting these you know useful indiscretions\nAnd they're all about well everyone should have redemption and but not for this if you're a conservative you can never be redeemed never\nRight well you have to do is is is have somebody claim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually they have some people on the record saying well we saw him at Yale we saw him a ... a drunk and she got belligerent a few times and so he doesn't have the temperament for the new questioned judge it as a former federal judge yourself\nThe idea of temperament because he was fairly aggressive in responding to the questions on Capitol Hill a last week that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court after having written two hundred decisions on the DC circuit he doesn't the temperament\nBut that's a great I'm no when proposition um if he gets upset um having been accused of um a sexual assault than he doesn't have the temperament if he doesn't get upset that he's guilty\nSo it's you know it's if he loses either way right well\nHow do you think that's ultimately plays out I mean that ... Democrats are of course are complaining that there's not enough I guess they interviewed that Deborah Ramirez over the weekend a hopped on that fast right or the president said FBI can has free rein that's the phrase he gave free rein a\nWell free rein to do presumably what the Senate requested um the Senate requested um a limited extension of the background check and background checks are\nAre not about you know we're not about ... I'm not criminal investigations and then I ... ... counter intelligence with their background investigations and they interview witnesses lay out what they say and present it to the Senate which ultimately makes the decision to send us the not the president\nOf the um I don't know if you saw the Jim Comey decided he needed to weigh in on on all of this so that you know he's weighing in on Kavanaugh saying well then he's\nYeah he's loaded up the the the expectations 'em by talking about the capabilities of the FBI without discussing water background investigation and [noise]\nYeah well again if if high school and college drinking is now is\nNow from the free love generation this is this is a this is now what we're going to be judged on I ... I don't know who want want these\nYou know these nominations I mean I don't know a lot of people frankly he didn't have something to drink in high school or college a few but not many and we all do stupid stuff and not you judge because you're just a\nOh heaven for fan right yeah no nothing nothing stupid stupid\nAt all because you're you're you're um UK is all about the rest of us did\nUm [noise]\nKavanaugh saying well he's yeah he's loaded up the the the expectations are by talking about the capabilities of the FBI without discussing water background investigation is\nYeah well again if if high school and college drinking is now is\nNow from the free love generation this is this is a this is now what we're going to be judged on I I I don't know who want want these\nYou know these nominations I mean I don't know a lotta people frankly he didn't have something to drink in high school or college a few but not many and we all do stupid stuff and not you judge because you're just that\nOh heaven for men right yeah no nothing nothing stupid\nStupid at all because you're you're you're um UK is all about the rest of us did\nNo um [noise] if there's anybody who would be willing to have every day of of his you've um penned up on a wall and examined then that person I don't think has led to a life of that would give them any kind of experience worthy of being a judge\nOr the other issue I just wanted to quickly weighing on this um\nThe American bar association a supposedly it was it was of course it was improperly reported early on uh that the a BA had withdrawn its recommendation that a judge Kavanaugh was you know highly qualified to be on the court and turns out that the\nPresident of the of the APA picked up a pen and at his letterhead a and wrote something he wasn't authorized to write um he's not the committee and um it was simply another reflection of the fact that the ... is is is generally left wing organization has been for years\nNow and he was a big supporter of Hillary Clinton uh and so you\nKnow the again initial reports all over cable on friday when I was on the panel on Fox in the morning on friday and it was a BA withdraws and again

but there are also doing it out of fear\nBecause they know that the logical ramifications of their own ideology comes right back boomerang right back at them so you get a guy like Donny dory sure you get all these other people say or white guy old white guy old white guy even when\nThey and their own like they're all white guys it's back to the end of the progressive idea that you\nHave Andrew McCabe said you'd get insurance you try to protest so loud that you're going to get some medieval dispensation that exempt you from what you're saying about other people it's back to Mark Zuckerberg lecturing everybody on the walls where you have this huge wall around all of his house\nAnd all these old white guys have privilege if you really believe Donny Deutsch you would say you know Donna

happy and he'd\nNever happens don't expect it\nNow ah the we have to touch on this Jerry Brown signing into law this idea that women have to be represented on public boards in\nUh in California there has to be female representation on public point at which point at which point I tweeted out none of the Pacific islanders Latinos and a black people they should all be up in arms here I mean where do they get to go they go to get their own representation on boards\nYeah I think that's a coded for a lot of very affluent women in the bay area\nWho want to be on a lot of these boards on there and that's where all of the decisions are made and so they want a mandate or inclusion but again you're seeing a fault line because you you hit it on the head and that is once you go down the idea that how we look\nWill be a Jew would be the case who we are and we have to do it in tribal fashion and indeed and percentage fashion of the population\nThan there are so many different tribes with claims\nOf victimization and reparation that's almost impossible to include them all so you're gonna have you're going to see a woman say well I I Want to be in that board because I'm not just a woman but I'm black or Latino you're a woman but you're only white\nTherefore I have I have greater credibility as being a person who deserves you know a set aside on this war a war going down there and I

hat he got food he got he got harassed backstage he said for a for actually having a hat on and supporting Trump so the left or will not tolerate any dissent Victor\nYeah I think there's two things going on one is that this Trump idea that you close the borders to only legal immigration and then you try to get the economy up at four percent GDP low unemployment means that people who are Americans and I've been over look like a lot of people in the inner city suddenly they have leverage\nAnd they have worth and that's the kind of a revolutionary messy so west and others are starting to see and that's a lot better for interests that are people going to be patronize wide government the title of the other thing that kinda reminds us that we want to get hung up on identity politics we always have to have the after its identity\nPolitics but it's all progressive so if you're west\nIt doesn't really matter you're black anymore because you have the wrong ideas and if you're ... you know Keith Ellison\n'em and you're charged with sexual assault well it doesn't really matter\nBecause you have the right ideas so ideology actually Trump's most cases you're gender or your race you
