and those folks can be returned to the United states\nThey could also uh you know change the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico\nThat you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states and again you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims if\nThey do they should be applying for asylum ... they should be applying for asylum let's hope but there are in addition ah the ah the administration is taking steps to end or as a rule where a company daily in a ... have to be released after twenty eight days\nUm Congress can you know step in and they can end before as a settlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or

even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter it's a it's a it's an emotional manipulation game and they want to they want to pull the heartstrings

over and over again\nIn ... we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that in\nOrder to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into the best facilities that we have available coverage can provide more money for that but here's really what it comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous\nRapes robberies murders or the Obama administration when they had similar uh programs we saw NPR run articles about as we saw National Geographic of all things\nI wrote an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all you see a little girl in a pink shirt standing next to her mother crying as border patrol agent make sure that her mother doesn't have any

know two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars a cost to get to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expected administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though are you doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given but\nThey can pay back once they work in the United states who are very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably work in their favor at this is another and said that the game you went back you verify that people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory e verify that's the key is the kingdom but until we get to that point we need to catch that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so do a good cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum from Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are ever going to leave the country is not the case if that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we are talking to you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God we're in the United states under ... they've received their due process or it's not like they're waiting for their their their hearing\nEverything that they had coming to them they've had but they remain in the United states we continue to work here again we have no ... no way\nTo verify that there are leading and\nEyes just lack of resources to go out and find ones and twos these people\nPlus you you put on top of that the sanctuary laws places like California and localities where you know people under five orders removal you know are apprehended by the police\nIt shows up on the rap sheet that they're under a puddle order removal and yet they get released a in back into society and they're not return to their home countries\nBut everybody needs to work together in order to make the system work when any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night art and he said that

five to ... percent of all people who claim credible fear found to have credible here even though the asylum numbers or a ... as you mentioned before\nThe problem is that if people allege that they

twenty days out of the midterms\nWorld War basically three weeks out and you have a you know it it has been closing up um I have been saying for some time and we have numbers the on off on the idea that from that but you know this election\nUm is still very winnable or the Republicans was killing that they do what they need to do which is\nAnd made them very slow out of a cabinet hearings I think of galvanized the even before that you could see that there were voters who are quite concerned with the shoe what I call chaos when you when you talk to voters about the potential\nYou you're talking I was one of the big three I Believe um that worries immigration you have\nA wall majority so huge majorities of people who oppose sanctuary cities who um are are in favor of 'em I mean who oppose I'm a\nI'm a what's happening at the border who who are warning or you have a belief that the I'm a huge huge majorities Oregon's abolishing ice which has become kind of a overnight it democratic\nParty um doctrine 'em and um and and who believe I'm ... and above twenty twenty Martin and people who believe that you know Democrats are\nMore likely basically you favor of the rights of

who oppose\nUm uh uh um uh what's happening\nAt the border who who are worried or you have a belief that the I'm a huge huge majorities are against abolishing ice which has become kind of a overnight the Democratic\nParty um doctrine 'em and um and and who believe 'em and and about twenty twenty margin and people who believe that you know Democrats are\nMore likely basically to favor of the rights of the illegal aliens\nThan they are the rights of citizens it's a theme that Trump has put on this is a big issue and it's across the board um and and um it change moves votes as does the another issue which is important because I Believe\nUm in light of the cabinet off a stop these numbers probably are even more important which is the\nWhen the argument that the Democrats if they take the house already many of them pledged and we now have their chairman um of there to be terminated today when they're sharing committee I'm sharing that are saying\nWell we're gonna we're gonna impeach cabinet and we're going to impeach Trump we've got all these investigations are a great belief that this will disrupt the economy\nAnd I'm a sense that um this is going to be ... chaotic and that it is going to weaponize the constitution for the purpose of going after unpopular president whatever they say we know that that's their agenda\nSome had had a couple of days later said just to recap so many issues that would drive Republican turnout and maybe maybe even win over some Democrats\nDr ... yes but we'll move was the number of Democrats and many independents civil move in the third big issue of course is what the Democrats are doing the Democratic socialism or someone said to me ah you know the Dems as they now refer to them the Democratic impeachment\nMob I'm a party um uh\nAnd you know the repeal they promise to repeal every piece of ... or reject every piece of the president's economic policies\nUm which are booming for most people are at least\nMuch more positive than they had been in years um these issues in the sense of the Democrats are opting to out of the middle\nOne democratic socialism but Hubbard all over the idea of chaos you know whether it is banging on windows they are going to disrupt the country in a way that it for two years would be awful for the most people see\nSome of the law and order and I'm not as much right now hold on let me just again law and order safety law and order ... the respect um\nYes those are really good terms and then there's the answer is is that they are so far out they are now with their projections of what they want to do or what they're saying saying\nThat this really bothers voters and that is what has been we've been seeing the closing up it is imperative that seems to me that those through what I call that prior to ...\nUm the Democrats have healthcare and you're not going to take that away from ... to like um but um except for the fact of what the cost is because that goes again\nYou have a third of more Democrats who oppose the idea\nTwo years would be awful for the most people see\nSome of the law and order and I'm not as let's say hold on let me just again law and order safety law and order calming the respect um\nRespect yes those are really good terms and then there's the answer is is that they are so far out they are now with their projections of what they want to do or what they're saying saying\nThat this really bothers voters and that is what has been we've been seeing the closing up it is imperative that seems to me that those through what I call that prior to ...\nUm the Democrats have healthcare and you're not going to take that away from ... to light 'em but um except for the fact that both the cost of cars that goes again\nYou have a third of more Democrats who oppose the idea of the Democratic party trying to Institute\nA social aid the Democratic socialism that bothers people and then she ... does\nOkay it is yeah hold on this is what Nate Silver of\nCourse the whole you know he's the he's the ... the statistical a journal and you know he practiced statistical journalism um and he you know he didn't get the production right and twenty sixteen or but this time he's saying\nPeople should not be that surprised by a Democratic Senate\nOr a Republican House where in dangerous territory from a productive assumptions standpoint he set of four and five chance may sound like a done deal but it's simply isn't a and he said it's ... it just because someone thinks\nSomething is a high probability it might be but it doesn't mean it's an inevitable\nFacts so when people think it's inevitable that Republicans lose the house and no one isn't high enough about it maybe it's likely historically but it's not inevitable and I think that's what a lot of Republicans have to get through their heads\nYes this is why it's still hanging 'em I leave it there must be very hard to be predicted business environment because you don't know what's going to drive\nThis thing at the end we have a the selection that there are many many things that are under law in this election most of all by the way is what like the Trump and sixteen a fear of returning the country to the hands of the political class\nA elites and the sense of of losing what progress the than made and the the that anti\nWashington anti leaders I'm Still exist very great with the issue has been for the Republican the nationalized the election I still don't think I still think there's more they could do they could run national advertising with these things right\nStop it and by the way it's cheaper to do and it's more effective because guess what when you buy network advertise you've got to be inside of the shows rather than crammed into the local three minutes five minutes to do with the and in the states with this these commercials\nYou get to stand on your own but they need to nationalize because then Harris lay off year elections are\nAre off year elections are um tend to be for people who were in the party that the the unhappy with disgruntled people who don't like Trump's trade between the but\nBut when you put the big issues in front of people consequences then something happens and I think the Republican doing and all the candidates are doing a better job of frankly the patch and the ... they have not gotten together\nTo do what they could do who um\nAnd it's more effective because guess what when you buy network advertise you to be inside of the shows rather than crammed in the local three minutes five minutes to do with the and in the states with these commercials\nYou get to stand on Europe but they need to nationalize because Harris lay off year elections are\nAre off year elections are um tend to be for people who were in the party that the the unhappy the disgruntled people who don't like Trump's trade tweets either\nBut when you put the big issues in front of people are consequences then something happens and I think the Republican giving him all the candidates are doing a better job of frankly the patch and the ... they have not gotten together\nTo do what they could do 'em to a national ... Berger national\nHound polite and now we have not and not just a local election out is\nIf there's a national election and people need to understand the choices\nBecause there are concerns are very great again having a hearing the beginning of the Supreme Court the driving people out of restaurants this incivility arguments recipes and have some numbers yesterday that showed overwhelming rejection of the Hillary Clinton proposition\n... even split among Democrats\nOf whether or not you know this notion that you can't be civil to when I'm there is and the things at the end they believe by the way by a large a priority that if the Democrats win civility will get worse\nThings will become worse than they are now\nI Want to play an anti below sea for you or this is below sea on

question they say the year the woman you have a lot of these interesting women running for office a lot of them former veterans and some of them doing really well so they are the woman you're the one it could also be the year the man\nOf because well are saying man and masculinity being attacked in the cabinet shop at an all\nYes I think there was a backlash I think that there is certainly a gender gap or goes both ways and the men are and and again I'd come back to it's not just rubbing up the Republican base there are huge numbers of independents remember the Trump carried\nIn twenty
