[laughter] you're a musician right\nYeah I was a major in college and it just from there I ended up working at the company not as a performer because I have a horrific stage right but and in their um marketing department box office and then and they're bringing about Arizona and I thought the girls and teaches why would I ride\nThat first show I was like oh my gosh this is so good and I became\nA little bit addicted and you have your ... your ... so good or bad thing about how the good thing in the ... she's a she's a sick to to work by sometimes your own health detriment we have to help her a little bit let let go a little bit of her stress and pressure because she's very very valuable in this community\nAnd the arts community but also as a person and truly if you've got another question for any of that 'cause you've you've got the prosecutor tutorial mentality so please feel free to go with somebody with anything else you want to go with right okay\nWell yeah actually I had had a question for for treated because your background is is fascinating I'm curious how do we teach had built those scales who were not able to teach them to the children and there's a whole generation that we've missed with financial literacy how do I teach the legislature\n[laughter] ... I'm not a question of are really have to answer that [laughter]\nYou know a ... it's interesting you ask because I've done everything to avoid the adult audience [laughter]\nBecause you know where we're kind of said why why why have you done everything devoid but we just kind of set in our ways you know we we were just where we were right and [laughter] and you know we have our set of fixed\nCore core values and principles that we were raised by we live by and we'd practiced for many decades and so we're not a fresh in our mind that creativity has diminished not not any of you in this world but overall generally speaking\nThank you for these I mean I [laughter]\nBut I just love fresh mindset on multiple lake habits and campuses ... spring so back to the adults and I would love to teach the adults now have had audience of adults when I taught the casual cash will get like the games because games exposed behavior\nAnd is it is an active learning versus passive learning and your retention is very high when it comes to playing games such as when we play monopoly you know I was ... or any kind of game we grew up playing with the cash looking like monopoly on steroids and his real life and living in his breathing he gets a lot of ourselves and so it's good for adult adult to break down a wall that way\nQuestion are you in June partnering up on something in the future because that's something that's happening when we are going to have to bring us back for another show that's another one we\nHad a quick id actually it gets into our technology discussion oh okay yeah and it gets to really being more a collective in are buying and in our purchasing so that's where the Enron thing going on about and thinking about legacy for future generations\nAnd I have had audience of adults when I talked to cash in cash and okay I like the game because games expose behavior\nAnd is it is an active learning versus pack of learning and your retention is very high when it comes to playing games such as when we play monopoly\nYou know I was ... or any kind of game we grew up playing but the catch looking like monopoly on steroids in his real life and living in his breathing he gets a lot of ourselves and so it's good for adults adults to break down a wall that way real quick\nQuestion are you in June we're partnering up on something in the future because that's something that's happening when we are only have to bring us back for another show that's another show Louie\nAcquaintance actually it gets into our technology discussion oh okay yeah and it gets to really being more a collective in are buying and then our purchasing so that's where the ... and thinking about legacy for future generations as well\nAnd bringing in nonprofits and purchase those that are not bound by systems I mean like heavy systems that went out and you can break through\nI I I think it's a noble goal but it's like herding cats I mean I can only imagine how children this might be\nIf they're challenging you know it may not happen in my lifetime so I I recognize that I'm raising the leaders of this generation and the millennials and then once before they millennials so that this this this vision and his project in his life goal or last long after I'm no I'm no longer here and it's going to work\nI Love that positive so that was a little bit more uh of what your concept is\nIt's a significant concept of shifting the way that you use your purchasing power so that you actually get a return on your\nInvestment to pay anything you can think of that you buy when you buy it at a regular store\nNot only do you pay to go to the store but you didn't stand in line and then you have to pay them and then you pay to get back home whereas if you use a collective buying system and you begin to use technology or your everyday purchases not only do you save money on going back and forth and shopping unless you're one of those weird old they're really like to do that and\nI tell you why do I want to learn to return on investment and the and the tea that for the weirdo is there a lot of the brick and mortar shutting down you know we're thinking about that and we voted in order\nThat's the great thing about what you brought up earlier June is that it's a way for just goes to give back because he has pretty much destroyed the brick and mortar so he ... I Hope he comes back and you guys I think it's great that you I I'm hoping that you have an in so that you can maybe you\nRemind him of ... we're not here we're not anti brick and mortar in fact we have not just a an air attack and and the er and cyberspace in an online we also have a ground attack with shop local excellent with a gun ... absolutely\nLet's get back to the uh the political candidates the district Fifteen kids in terms of how again relating\nAre you guys as mothers you guys are professionals and all of a sudden the the the the conversation here with the technology and the financial how do you how do you bring that all into like a legislative experience or even a prosecutor pure prosecutorial experience how do you good relayed all that\nYeah the technology and the ground game which is what one the last few presidential election\nJulian a ... a Christian to go to come to some comments in that direction\nI think if you if you look at the federal level right now our legislature is are are clearly I'm behind the times when it comes to technology and communication online\nAnd what can be ahead of the time ... on a political ads that destroy 'cause that's where they seem to be way ahead on the way ahead on how bad they seem to be very good at that yeah\nBut I mean you see testimony in Congress where they talk about\nAgain relating are you guys whose mothers you guys are professionals and all of us on the conversation here with the technology and the financial how do you how do you bring them at all interested in like a legislative experience or even a prosecutor pure prosecutorial screwed how do you good relayed all that\nYeah the technology and the ground game which is what one the last few presidential election\nJulian a ... a Christian good comes some comments in that direction\nWell I think if you if you look at the federal level right now our legislature is are are clearly I'm behind the times when it comes to technology and communication online\nAnd what can be ahead of the time ... on a political ads that destroy\n'cause that's where they seem to be way ahead at least on the way ahead on how bad they seem to be very good at that yeah\nBut I mean you see testimony in Congress where they talk about things like Facebook and it's clear that our senators and Congress people don't understand how we communicate on line and it's you know it's an organic thing that online communication it it's not really been plan from the top down but we need people who understand how those things happen so\nHow how do we engage in that organic communication online and how do we found found those online communities and when we have representation\nAt the legislature I both at the state and national level that don't understand how those things emerged we can't get ahead of them and plan that and clearly we've had cyberattacks they don't even understand that security aspect let alone the founding of\nCommunities on line\nWhen you're running for state Senate district with my running for state Senate districts and you're probably way ahead by no issue [noise] sure\n[laughter] oh you're running for a representative state representative and district Fifteen right true story and you're weird too 'cause 'cause you know you know the you know the dollar amounts that are illegal and that was [laughter] it goes right [laughter] [laughter]\nArizona I mean it to tie it into the prosecutorial experience are going to need to do more about cyber crime and needs to be smarter about how we approach it\nBut how we approach technology is such a it's such a bigger problem at our legislature and making sure that people understand\nOne of the things that I I've been in favor for a long time\nUm and that would be one of the keys to economic prosperity in Arizona for everyone it municipal broadband what does that mean even if we need high speed Internet ad a low costs in Arizona we have it our Internet is controlled by a few providers\nWho are now free to discriminate against what content goes through those lines and we need to do more in Arizona we want to be a tech hub\nFor not only our generation but the generation of future leaders that we're raising now\nWe need somebody might remember the term net neutrality we need a net neutrality and we can legislate that on a state level as well and you see that\nHow that impact and that neutrality impacted the firefighting in California when variety than shut down and her but I you know\nAnd that neutrality and super important creating access to the Internet for low income communities because again we perpetuate this wealth gap that we talked about on the last show when we don't allow access to online resources on us I'm going\nTo have concerns about see our radio show dot com that once I started posting are shows they're going to cut it\n[laughter] I real quick I got a question of ... and I have a very short we got a short time of the segment with Nick but\nUh I mean you've heard of the show is gone [laughter] all the rights for them or shut it down\nIt's a ... it seems as if I'm ... I'm kind of stupid it was almost stuff but it seems as if the Facebook's from Twitter's get away with a lot because I'm not ... that they can say well it's not our job to screen thing is not our job to get the idiots off\nWe perpetuate the wealth out on the last show when we allow access on line ... calling us from going\nNow I have concerns about see our radio show dot com that once I started posting our show if they're going to kind of [noise]\nI I got a question I I have a very short short time in a segment ethnic but uh I mean you've\nHeard of that show is gone [laughter] All right for them that shut it down\nOr you know it seems as if I'm ... I'm kind of stupid and some of the stuff but it seems as if the facebooks and twitters get away with a lot because I'm not mistaken that if they can say well it's not our job to screen thing it's not our job to get the idiots off\nSo memorizing information doesn't help but they need to have access to it and things like net neutrality which limit their access to that information are problematic we need to have that you know couple you have\nThe access the information and you have the critical thinking skills in order to differentiate between good and bad information and right now the legislature on both levels\nIt had said well we can we can discriminate against certain sources of information so they could in theory say we're going to charge you more for the New York times or we're going to charge you more for accepting PBS's website um it doesn't have to be something like that like Netflix that could actually be a censorship censorship issue coming down the pipeline\nA and we need to make sure that we have open access that information and that we are coupling it with literacy about technology and problem solving critical thinking skills that they can evaluate what they're reading\nThat goes back to a story I told several months ago about going into a subway in the um when I made the purchase than there are gallons giving me my change back short changed me like seven cents and I said well you shortchanged me seven cents and she said no the machines\nAre or what it is [laughter]\nIn my head but I'm going to see the wrong [laughter] yeah but the machine so then I was right as long as she was very\nHesitant to believe me that what I was showing or in my hand was was wrong and she believed the machine over me\nYeah and that's why we need to fully fund our K. through twelve\nCool [laughter] very ill and rationalize is a multi billion dollar housing was seven [laughter] Joan Rivers picture [laughter]\nAnd I think along those lines to which I've been noticing about on the cell phones and Google and all that\nWhen I was young we used to have you know really good in debt debate like what are the worst of the song me really stuff but we could argue our way out of it and there'll be wrong because we didn't have the phone right there [laughter] but it is right so we need to have instead of debates about fact we need to have debates\nAbout value which I think it's sorely lacking at at our\nAt legislative let 'em\nRon [laughter] yeah but the machine so then I was right as long as she was very hesitant to believe me that what I was showing or in my hand was was wrong and she believed the machine over me\nYeah and that's why we need to fully fund our K. through twelve\nCool [laughter] [laughter] it was a multi billion dollar housing where I was seven [laughter] Joan Rivers picture [laughter]\nAnd I think along those lines to which I've been noticing about on the cell phones and Google and all that when I was young we used to have you know really good in debt debate like what are the worst of the song me really stuff but we could argue our way out of it and there'll be wrong because we didn't have the phone right there [laughter] but it is right\nSo we need to have instead of debates about fact we need to have debates about value which I think it's sorely lacking at at our\nA legislative let 'em up\nWell in part I think what can I I tried to present both sides things I think that for many years there's you know starting with\nBluntly Rush Limbaugh and talk radio many years ago there's been an opinion that there's been a liberal bias in media in politics whatever and so it's really hard to get a starting point when people are so people are suspicious of tech as being liberal bias\nBut it was especially since they're Silicon Valley San Francisco based and I think we're all blind the potential for owned biased who's so people people start with the screwed up your point of what is affecting what's liberal conservative and so I again I I go back to\nYou guys going the legislature where people don't want to necessarily find things to agree on they may win on finding things have disagree on\nSo I Know that Julie and I have talked about that is one of the things that it's important our legislature in Arizona and Republican controlled for sixty years and it's not necessarily that it's Republicans at the fact that it's one party and that there hasn't been that reaching across the aisle that really it's so important impactful and\nWe need to get to that agreement [noise] well\nYeah I mean into that and um I Lived in Chicago and I can tell you that no party has a monopoly on corruption absolutely no conflicts of interest\nTaking dirty money ah it's it's not about it it's not about whether it's a Republican thing or a democratic thing it's about unchecked power and one party not having to talk to the other party\nThe heirs of unchecked power sixty sixty and so and that's the problem it's not it isn't a party thing it's not what by your name is about do you have the ability to reach across find common ground their issues we're all concerned with Rob concerned with our kids and the education they get real concerned with the safety and security of our families\nAnd we can work together if we can identify the common values we can work together to figure out how to solve them\nChristian real quick contact information are reluctant information you want to don't require\nSo my website is W.

like hey here since not a good woman like I Am and you are I think maybe to a certain extent but I really think that I think it's a pitch that at men yeah but the thing that I think that she's more of a woman who they can relate to than cures cinema and\nBut as bad as it is she's such a lie or she pulled out of there being held here she voted now she's now she's going to her ... pre existing

take it out on the people who are caused havoc in America\nI think it out at the ballot box writer absolutely oh let's let's make sure we're doing everything we can have about seven events I'm going to today ... well I'm\nAre estimated to cost us two trillion dollars over the next ten years so Mitch McConnell I don't believe really even care about the deficit or debt what he's doing is using that\nTo create a reason to go after Social Security\nMedicare and Medicaid and\nPeople need to pay very careful attention to that they've been trying to do this for years they tried to do at\nA few years ago and and Obama is a a first term and then again in his second term using a court the deficit and panicking over the deficit to get to try and persuade President Obama to sign along to\nI'm a ... so called reforms that Social Security such as chained CPI which is on refer to the consumer price index and it's like the basket of goods they used to determine how much Social Security you should get based on inflation\nSo what they do it they kind of make substitutions with the items in the CPI basket\nTo justify giving seniors last money that's one of the ways they can do it they they talk about things like means testing which sounds okay it's like well why should millionaires and billionaires get a big bigger Social Security check and you are not you or I Do right except\nThe savings gained from means testing at that level it's very little said they're gonna do means testing to get the kind of savings they would require to bring down the death and said that they created you'd have to go way further down the income scale and it would really affect a lot of people who could not afford\nTo have their their Social Security cut similarly with Medicare they talk about things like turning it into a voucher program which is basically instead of you\nHow much Social Security you should get based on inflation\nSo what they do it they kind of make substitutions with the items in the CPI basket\nTo justify giving seniors last money that's one of the ways they can do it they they talk about things like means testing which sounds okay it's like well why should

do means testing to get the kind of savings they would require to bring down the death and said that they created you'd have to go way further down the the income scale and it would really affect a lot of people who could not afford\nTo have their their Social Security cut similarly with Medicare they talk about things like turning it into a voucher program which is basically instead of your regular Medicare that we've all grown if you're on it you're accustomed to it it works very well I'm looking forward to being on it some day they turn it into basically a coupon\nIt's very it's an order the vouchers in school it's like here's a coupon to go to a doctor it may cover forty percent you're on the hook for the rest of it Medicare covered much more doesn't cover a hundred percent of your mental medical bills but can't cover a lot of them Medicaid\nIssue affecting people of all ages but it's actually seniors\nA lot of seniors a nursing care their their final care and the last months of their lives that they you know that they need it covered by Medicaid because at that point they've exhausted their life savings and ... and step and cuts to Medicaid ... absolutely\nDevastate care to seniors as well so it's three things it's Social Security Medicare and Medicaid and Mitch McConnell and after them and the only way to stop him\nIt's to elect Democrats\nAnd the and that's ... ... absolutely effect because the simple fact is every other country in the world provide health care to all their citizens why shouldn't America viewed Rob\nRoman they're also talking about cutting back and food stamps which is particularly hits rural areas and cutting back on VA you know the the the salaries of the world claim of support VA Bush supported the idea that we have to cut back the VA because it costs too much\nMick Reilly is such a lawyers who is the worst layer I have ever seen campaigning\nAgainst held here against socialist ends against veterans and then she's got a nerve to say that she's in favor of these things she is Trump's biggest pop it in the administration she's been terrible in the house you certainly does not need to be in the Senate\nBecause I'll tell you Mitch McConnell will use her like a violin and the cut off all the services that seniors need so\nDesperately in this country we are to congressional races are going to be close Stanton encourage Patrick's and both of those two Republican candidate said they support Trump one hundred percent which means they also support cutting Medicare ... cutting Medicaid cuts in Social Security cutting the VA cutting food stamp\nAnd then further tax cuts that to justify more further cuts to adhere to a social services\nYou know and if that much ... and if McConnell were was honest with the with the American people first of all his wife has a very very cushy job working for Trump\nAnd and Trump owns him he's got 'em by the short hairs yeah quarter report is she doesn't show up work anymore she has a lot of ex well who's with us it is ... that's the\nSame story yeah she had no she's not paying any one on her staff or something I I've I it's\nVery strange I think she had some like some work to do on her financial report\nYeah yeah both we are going to be back and we're going to tell you in great detail\nWhich means they also support cutting Medicare ... cutting Medicaid cut his Social Security cutting the VA cutting boosting\nAnd then further tax cuts that to justify more further cuts to ... to a social services\nYou know and if that much ... and if

foremost\nA as a friend I'm a fan a and I think you are for what you're doing and continue to do we're going to dive into some sort of how you got started but first we gotta go way back you got an art background brother\n[laughter] yeah I did start off in art school and a quickly realized that probably the best I could amount to is a either an art teacher or doing greeting cards\nOh wait a minute we do that our our our we've got since we have right now I'm a Palin well\nWell I I Know or I Am not saying either one of those things are a bad thing it's just that that didn't appeal to me so I decided to take sort of a left turn but stay with the New York realm\nI moved to Pittsburg and went to the artist into Pittsburgh there for a special effects makeup and industrial design ... solid learning how to make monsters\nAnd I saw some of these pictures you you you you put out a pretty good monster [laughter]\nI didn't I didn't really I didn't really have dads who much make\n[noise] yeah I did start off in art school and a quickly realized that probably the best I could amount to is a either an art teacher or doing greeting cards\nOh wait a minute we do that are only now we've got since we have right now I'm a pound and\nWell ... well I I Know are I I'm not saying either one of those things are a bad thing it's just that that didn't appeal to me so I decided to take sort of a left turn but stay with the New York realm\nI moved to Pittsburg and went to the artist into Pittsburgh there for a special effects makeup and industrial design ... so I was learning how to make monsters\nAnd I saw some of these pictures you you you you put on a pretty good monster\n[laughter]\nI didn't I didn't really I didn't really have dad too much makeup to some of those things and some of those were appliances on myself\nBut I I went to that school for a year absolutely loved it and I love the process of you know thinking of something and then bringing it into the real world that's something that very much excited me but unfortunately because the finances I wasn't able to finish school so I was sort of set adrift for a while\nAnd I had some strange job during that time I made some fake trees and\nUh you know worked at some fast food restaurants and things\nWe got Eric the car guy Eric how you are hanging with author you there yes I Am sir\nThank you brother want to thank you again for a hanging out with us and we asked the question and you had mentioned building confidence which is incredible\nIt's not so much how to but I Want to build your confidence and I know you've inspired a lot of folks to to take that on their own and have those wins in the in their garage or in their driveway about fixing their car\nOr these cars can get is you know with a ton of its platforms in that connected car and all these can control the networks that are under hood is there a point where\nYou have had in the comments section\nA particular individual that you can sort of sense that they may be going in over their head when do you cut that short and say hey best to take it in maybe have that particular electrical or any evaporative fault you know those can be complicated\nHow you handle that direction when you tell someone hey best to take it over to a professional like now that\nI'm you you can easily than that I mean if they're starting to well usually the people to throw in many many parts at it that's\nUsually where I Try to draw the line and say you know you're not really diagnosing here just sort of guessing and and using the arts cannon so that\nSo Thomas platforms and that connected car and all these can control the networks that are under hood\nIs there a point where you have had in the\nComments section a particular individual that you can sort of sense that they may be going in over their head when do you cut that short and say hey best to take it in and maybe have that particular electrical or any evaporative fault you know those can be complicated\nHow you handle that direction when you tell someone hey best to take it over to a professional like now that\nI'm you you can easily than that I mean if they're starting to well usually the people to throw in many many parts that it that's usually where I Try to draw the line and say you know you're not really diagnosing here just sort of guessing and\nAnd using the arts cannon so that's one thing and and I often discourage people from doing their own ac work also\nYeah that can be complicated we of covered in the past or ISI recharge tens or they can be dangerous and then way overboard I mean to to take a complex system like an air conditioning system and look at a gauge that is at yellow free okay I'm good you know a little more intense than just watching the gates\nSo I ... I Know complex six cents when um are they actually like painting you or they reaching out to you and saying hey what do I do not\nOh yeah all the time or either and comments or on social media\nBut I've actually tried to structure my website and such a way to where people can go there and get answers to the most popular ask questions that I've had in fact I've spent years putting those articles together with videos and things so that they can just go there and followed a trouble shooting steps that could possibly lead them to a solution\nAnd we remind you we don't want to just assume that you see in the car guy on YouTube but please visit Eric the car guide dot com\nUm that's an amazing sight there is a library of goodness there is something on that site that is related to what you may have as a need for car care and perhaps you not prone to fixing it yourself but you want to get an idea here if you do an amazing job of kind of\nYour very meticulous I think that's part of your six at um you know without knocking anybody else out there that is attempting to sort of educate on car care it truly comes down to your meticulous approach about step\nBy step and if anything if someone's not looking to fix their own stuff you know at least armed up to have a wonderful visual and asking their mechanic hey not so much that you're going to fix it the way he said but I have an idea and scope of this this is my symptoms\nThey can expect a few things that's often that you do that\nWell you know what's interesting is that because that's exactly what I set out to do I figured if people weren't going to be capable of doing the repairs nothing else that they were\nYou know given a big estimate from a shop that they would at least have some inclination of what that repair involved so they could say to themselves yeah that would be worth the money or a that guy just ripping you off or something like that so yeah that that's part of what I Do also\nOne of the things we see in the industry and in a funny ADL way I you know being the unicorn and\nNot necessarily the black sheep but the unicorn that I can be and sort of getting folks to think at a higher level in our industry folks have a tendency uh on the garage side mainly the independence of saying oh gosh here's another customer\nI found it on YouTube and when I have been barking for years to sort of quietly representing the common sense of it all is hey you need to change your approach if they were educated in a way you need to invite that and get back\nEstimate from a shop that they would at least have some inclination of what that repair involved so they could say to themselves yeah that would be worth the money or a that guy just ripping you off or something like that so yeah that that's part of what I Do also\nYeah one of the things we see in the industry and in a funny on all the way I you know being the unicorn and\nNot necessarily the black sheep but the unicorn that I can be and sort of getting folks to think at a higher level in our industry folks have a tendency or on the garage side mainly the independence of saying oh gosh here's another customer\nI founded on YouTube and when I have been barking for years to sort of quietly representing the common sense of it all is hey you need to change your approach if they were educated in a way you need to invite that and get back to the brass tacks of what's your symptom\nBecause a lot of us in the industry we have this problem that we don't know how to ask the right questions and we lose control of the very important first\nStep of well what's your symptoms you know so I just want to make you aware that you probably are and we're going to talk about some of the good works that you're doing across the industry with the future of\nA automotive mechanics and that interest or\nA ... recently you were a with universal technical Institute duty I\nA bogus one eighty autos here locally she's a rock star and of course Hubble mechanic another rock star out there educating tell us about that experience you had an opportunity to talk about your past and inspire the next generation\nFor first those two people or people that I there is some of the finest human being a planet so it was really nice to be able to to be with them but\nI you know I like the perspective we all come from you know different backgrounds have different takes on the auto industry and what it's like to live and work as a technician so it's a lot of good came out I think it was a great discussion\nYeah it was and I think it's really cool to see a movement that's happening you know years ago was shop against shopper dealer against dealer\nA mechanic against mechanic maybe not so much mechanic against mechanic but\nThere's this sense of oh
