extraordinary author a founder of ah surely bans are public affairs and dish and everything else he does a but Craig the more I see this this coverage is sob story coverage of the caravan the more I think about what these individual who would do if someone\nBreached their threshold in their own homes and whether they would ... you know welcome them in give them food shelter tell him to stay a while would they of course not welcome are loud\nThough of course not and we know the answer of Mexico when they invaded there a country is is that the assaulted police officers there well first of all we need to stop calling this a caravan of ... justice is fun comical or fraud or a car you know a circus or something like this\nThis is a mob of illegals that's all it is no no better no more no\nInvasion it's an invasion\nPrecisely and these everybody everybody is a member of Congress swore an oath to protect the United states gets all enemies foreign and domestic\nRight from the president and out every member of Congress they are a duty bound to protect this country against all enemies foreign and domestic and these these are illegal and if they cross the border than their enemies that's all there is to it and if they're not they should resign their office\nI think again the fact that we are not all hands on deck to stop this right and that I mean the president is apparently the only person willing to really cold is what it is\nWe don't violate the immigration laws of Guatemala Mexico ignore the rule of law in are about to do it in this country right\nWhat what are you better than the older they're not criminals well ... well [laughter] they have no respect for country's sovereignty or borders period\nWhich makes them criminals that de facto makes them

but I wouldn't I I don't like the word asylum because to me means somebody\nIn the United states because of political oppression is that these people are not politically oppressed this there's no such thing as economic asylum only political asylum and so if you come here for the goodies for the free stuff for the handouts for the welfare for the food stamps is that you're not coming here for asylum you're just come here to to\nTo you know to you know pond yourself up on society without giving anything back with these people a word water to their own country anyway but the fact is is that they need to go back\nWell and again I'm not the president\nSeems to have the pulse of the people again better than any other American politician on us yeah I mean I'm Talking I was I was I'm shopping with the kids over the weekend\n[noise] and you know I'm In my my mom\nSoccer clothes and my son is on so nobody knows why nobody knows who I Am and my with my uh with my camouflage baseball cap on

listen to people everybody's talking about this and it was outraged about this nobody's nobody's ever this except for the elites but the funny thing is that at least never let these illegals into the neighborhoods anyway\nNo bingo well they want they they don't want their classrooms filled with people who speak multiple languages don't speak English\nOr ... you know they don't wanna backyards yes there are private they're private schools\nAnd there's nothing to do with skin color where you come from ... has everything to do with the fact that this becomes a burden on the system if you don't have an orderly process of immigration puree like in and it's it's just absurd let's let's um I Wonder\nIf that's the other thing Trump needs to ram home and the Republican Party and anybody concerned about the rule laws every one of these people in this movable mob of illegals could apply for citizenship all they have to do is go to the process\nI Know they don't want to do that and I said well I

forward it's not going to be a caravan this is a mobile mob\nA ... I Want to play something from your dear friend John ...\nWho has moved so far left now that he's on a regular panelist on MSNBC this is what he said about the\nDemocrats' chances of a massive blue waves wave now slipping away because of cabin on probably this immigration and these great numbers on the economy that came out today with Trump's approval Republicans approval way way up um listen\nTrump is not a whole new force in American politics he but he is the most vivid manifestation of many of our worst characteristics\nYou know the constitution was written for moments like this it assumed that we we're sinful and driven by ambition and appetite and greed twice they made it so hard for us to get anything done [laughter]\nThey basically bad that we would get things wrong more often than we get them right and we have proven them correct ah with with astonishing regularity\nReaction to that\nBut I I agree with his analysis of the constitution but to what end to what point I don't understand the point he was making is is that what is Trump gun to violate the constitution says like Trump is supporting the constitution is the liberals who were were were were opposing the

for the worse fifty one percent of voters are said they want their congressional candidate to talk about immigration\nA lot that's fascinating\nLess than ten percent of voters support current levels of immigration and to the United states as opposed to eighty one percent of voters who support curbing immigration levels\nThat's a Harvard Harris Poll that was done at the beginning of this year a

sixty one thousand illegal aliens he they tend to senior high button\nFor illegal aliens and our general was simply stepped in and stopped that policy\nAnd got rid of it but yes it's the difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater\nI fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he joins them those certificates and I believe we need to indulge sanctuary city policy I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end\nThis diversity lottery and I think so brightest somebody there at the border

should be making their way through Mexico if we had handled this asylum issue properly and close these loopholes and funded this wall\nWell you're exactly right and of course my doctor legislation\nHas passed twice in the house but we couldn't get to send it to take that up and that is a good place to start and to remind people is that is in executive Menlo program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo dealing with those issues funding the wall I Am so putting a that money on the timetable and developing a timetable for securing that southern border you know large you realize\nWalls work anybody that doubts that don't talk to Israel walls work and what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country\nThat ought not to be
