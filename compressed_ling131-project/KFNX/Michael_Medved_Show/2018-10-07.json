buying a home is one of the largest purchases they'll ever make what risk you have when you buy a home for one you ever ask a market value lost many people are in that in two thousand eight right\nMany people thought that there was no significant risk from your home and going down in value but that perception is now changed forever what about risk of property loss flood fire earthquake when storm or theft those are all things that could destroy the value of your home investment\nOther properties you might only have the same risks if you own a car a boat airplane or any other property was significant value there is a risk of loss when you own something of significant material value what do you do to protect yourself from financial loss\nI think you know the obvious answer here you get insurance on those assets right the church costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they'll probably never use so why would you buy insurance on your home\nYou might say well I have a loan on my house so I have to buy insurance on it so that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for what'd you still buy insurance on your home I bet you would but why\nWhether you realize it or not\nYou'd buy insurance on your home because of something called a catastrophic risk\nCatastrophic risk means that you have any chance even if it's a small chance to lose a lot of value in other words you can lose a lot of money if something bad happens\nThe reason we buy insurance on our home is because the cost of insurance is very small compared to the last we might incur if a catastrophic event happens\nJust for the fun of it let's assume you\nLive in a modern home it's up to current building codes you don't smoke and fall asleep in your bed you don't light candles and leave them on attended and you don't put fried chicken on the stove and leave the catch it\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out on top of the loss\nThat's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my list there's this when does negative thirty plus forty three equals zero and the answer when you lose thirty percent in the market it takes me forty three percent gain just to get back to zero\nHere's another question when did negative thirty equals zero and the answer\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out\nOn top of the loss that's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my list is is is when does negative thirty plus forty three equals zero\nThen the answer when you lose thirty percent in the market it takes a forty three percent again just to get back to zero\nHere's another question when does negative thirty equals zero and the answer is one year my client that's because my clients have no possibility of market losses\nSo you never have to worry about trying to regain those losses also upfront bonuses of up to ten percent when you begin your account they guaranteed lifetime income account that contractually

of your life savings that exposed to market risk\nIs a very important consideration for you that's why I strongly encourage everyone to think about their money in terms of red money and green money

higher return with red money we accept the possibility of losses even significant losses in hopes of greater games\nRead money is always exposed to the upside and downside of market risk\nGreen money on the other hand is about safety and security when green money were not willing to accept the risk of losses showed this money typically we're willing to accept a lower return in exchange for safety and security\nGreen money does not have downsides market risk so Fred money is exposed upside and downside market risk angry money has only upside market potential which ones better\nWell that's probably the wrong question to be asking because neither one is inherently good or bad\nIt all depends on your situation the very important question we should ask ourselves or these what percentage of my money should be in red money and what percentage of my money should be angry money\nIf you're at or near retirement you should ask yourself if any of your money should be in red money are you
