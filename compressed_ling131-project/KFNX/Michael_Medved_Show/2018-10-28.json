the definition of insanity as going to Albert Einstein is doing the same thing\nOver and over again expecting different results from the moment you started investing you're probably fresh out of high school or college I'm sure it became very apparent to you that the market goes up and the market goes down\nYou've seen it over and over again that every few years the market crashes and sometimes it crashes hard\nFor most of your life you didn't really care in fact if you're like me I wanted the market crash back in my younger years why because it was a buying opportunity besides I knew the market would recover and I was young enough that I wasn't going to be using the money anytime soon anyway\nThings are different now closer I get to retirement the last cavalier I get towards my retirement money the more I realized that I have very little or no time to recover from a major market correction Mark Twain once said I'm not so interested in return on my money as the return of my money\nFresh out of high school or college I'm sure it became very apparent to you that the market goes up and the market goes down\nYou've seen it over and over again that every few years the market

opportunity besides I knew the market would recover and I was young enough that I wasn't going to be using it in the money anytime soon anyway\nThings are different now closer I get to retirement the last cavalier I get towards my retirement money the more I realized that I have very little or no time to recover from a major market correction\nMark Twain once said I'm not so interested in return on my money as the return of my money this cold is this true today as it was when he sat at corruption uncertainty and the ups and downs of the market they haven't gone away are you interested more in the return of your money\nWhat if we could do more than that\nGive us a call at eight four four three seven one safe that's eight four four three seven one seven to three three we have a free save

your money and up to seven percent Tom pounded growth\nIn ten years your lifetime income account would be guaranteed to more than double does this sound different than what you're being told by the other financial shows or the other brokers out there I Know it is because we keep you from doing something and saying with the retirement\nRemember the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results the truth is that nothing's changed your portfolio is at risk when you were twenty five years old just as much as it's at risk today\nSo what's the difference the difference is your age your time period for recovery\nWhat makes putting your retirement money in the stock market bonds variable annuities are any variable investment crazy is that you're doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results the results aren't going to be different\nYour investments will go up and your investments will crash\nWhat's different

crazy have you heard of something called a financial illustration you probably had and just maybe don't know it\nWhen you go and you see a financial planner\nThat it's in the business of risking your money they might use their computer software to run examples of what could happen to your money sometimes these examples are based on historical data and sometimes they're flat out just as Derek all\nI had a client the other day that showed me an illustration from their broker that demonstrate a what would happen to their money if it continued to grow over the next ten years at twelve percent compound a growth can you believe that ... percent compound to grow up where do financial planners get the nerve to even print that on paper\nWhat's even crazier is I've never seen an illustration from one of these brokers that shows what happens to clients' money if they wake up one day and fifty percent of their money is gone now why not\nCouldn't that happened you bet it could and in fact so I'm here today might be in that very situation it's so easy for financial salespeople the show you the best possible results and then just to be fair show you may be some moderate losses on these illustrations\nI think every financial professional should be required to show their prospective clients what the worst results were from the clients they manage let me ask you if you were thinking about working with a financial planner and you found out that the last fifty percent of their clients retirement funds would you want to work with them\nWell now that I brought it up you're probably thinking that very same question about me have I ever lost any of my clients money and the answer is one hundred percent positively no\nNot only does not a single penny of my compensation come out of your money but not a single penny of your money can ever be lost to the market declines one hundred percent of your money will start to work for you day one and it will never go backwards due to
