them\nAnd let us know if you're interested in how you can get up to seven percent compounded annual return for up to Twenty years in a lifetime income account would that account you can be guaranteed an income that you can never outlive\nUs to talk about why no market strategies are so important and why should not expose your retirement to the risk of the market\nJust reminds me of something you know here in the value of the sun we have all these beautiful hiking trails around in some can get pretty rocky and steep the other day I was watching some kids climb up on a tall rock had a steep face\nAnd they got up to the top they weren't even worried about falling they had no thought of how they were going to get down there was just no apparent concern for potential bodily harm\nAs I watch them it dawned on me how risking their bodily health\nBecause they were young they had no concern and it's very similar to risky money in retirement they both have consequences for example when we're young we have no problem going up those hills in rocks slipping in sliding then coming back down as little thoughts of danger consequences\nAnd along the way getting some bumps and bruises it's just easier to heal up from it when you're young\nOnce you get older though we may still go hiking but it's probably with a bit more cautious and\nThe reason for this simple as we get older the ability for our bodies to absorb physical punishment it's decreased and the time it takes to recover it increased if you think about it the same is true for our money\nWhen we're young we can absorb the bumps or bruises you can absorb the huge losses any retirement money you know because of the time period available to recover was much longer however when you're in retirement or close to retirement\nThere's little to no time to recover from those losses\nThe no marketing strategies I work with allow you to see the beauty without the danger you can still get to participate in the fun without any of the

without the market risks\nWhile reducing or eliminating the fees so you can throw away the worry knowing that your retirement money is safe and growing\nCall eight four four three seven one seven to three three\nWe've talked about how the real risk of exposure to the markets isn't discussed in the media or by brokerage houses we use no market rich strategies based on specialized plans that can provide first year returns of up to ten percent or more\nPlus they include contractual guarantees that you'll never suffer a loss because of a stock market decline\nWhile at the same time you'll be locking in your annual gains and also remember no fees are loads are taken from your deposit\nThe message here is different from what you normally hear on a financial planning show largely because our concepts are different\nMost brokers based their financial planning on something called modern portfolio theory this theory basically divided up your money and puts it into different investment categories another word for this is diversification the process of diversification is supposed to minimize your losses if the market drops\nOne thing that's rarely talked about though is that it also

strategy that allows you to build up an income account the compounds that up to seven percent per year this account can be used to guarantee you that you'll never outlive your retirement money you see when you suffer a loss in the market\nEven if it's a small loss you have three problems the lost value is just one problem the second problem is the time it takes to make back that loss\nBut the third problem is is it's almost impossible for you to regained your losses let me explain if you have a market exposed account of a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd the market drops by thirty percent your account has dropped to Seventy thousand very painful right\nBut that's just the beginning imagine the markets go back up the following year by thirty percent do you think you're back to your original hundred thousand the real answer is absolutely not now why not it's the cruel math of losses\nHere's why after dropping thirty percent the account is at Seventy thousand\nSo the thirty percent gain in the following year on the way back up his gain on only Seventy thousand thirty percent of Seventy thousand there's only Twenty one thousand and when you add the Twenty one to the Seventy that's left over it's only Ninety One thousand\nSo the real math is that it would take a forty three percent gain just to get back to where we started which was a hundred thousand\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out on top of the loss\nThat's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my list there's this windows negative thirty plus forty three equals zero and the answer when you lose thirty percent in the market it takes eight forty three percent again just to get back to zero\nSo the real math is that it would take a forty three percent gain just to get back to where we started which was a hundred thousand\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out on top of the law\nThat's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my list is is is when does negative thirty plus forty three equals zero and the answer when you lose thirty percent in the market it takes me forty three percent again just to get back to zero", "show_name":
