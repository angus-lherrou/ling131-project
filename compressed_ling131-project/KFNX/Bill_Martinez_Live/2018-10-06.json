so you know the minimum is twelve months the ideal thing is Eighteen to twenty four months so by the introduction of food of course her the jets for drags not ready\nSo all manner of weird things can happen [noise] so what do you have to do now\nIs the damage control so number one other than your breast milk she shouldn't be getting any meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products okay that would be number one\nNumber two we've got a check to be sure you are getting enough salt so she's getting enough soldiers who she can make enough hydro cleric acid at her stomach to kill any of the bugs that are in the body\nAnd whenever we see his skin problem you always want to think of the intestine something's wrong in the intestine so whatever you're feeding her you want to make sure that none of the foods contain added oil\nYeah how old is your daughter and how much does she weigh\nPatty and hunting pay five\nOr ... or you know what's going on with her wisdom teeth\nIt don't then ... fourth fifth done taped\nOkay why is that uh the I'm not\nGetting out the had them I think it's just so off the soft and get a\nEasily decay yeah OK well but that's not a reason to remove him because that gives you a lot of biting surface in my opinion is you always want to keep every two to you got your mouth\nOr what I Would do of course is to make sure that she brushes and flaws says and you monitor that choose to make sure and if it does decay you can use the low fusing ceramic materials we stronger than your original to\nOnce it's laser bonded in there and then you keep all inviting surface you see the upper teeth of your mouth are used by the body to respirator the base of the brain so you don't want to lose a to Z unless it's inside ways are infected or something's really bad about it

Green Zone six four to seven oh\nNow she consumes a lot of dairy products or\nOr meat fish poultry eggs in may be very difficult to have this ph where it belongs and when it's not there then it's very common that wheel grind or teeth\nSo I Would keep the by guard until you can see a first morning urine ph that holds for a good two three four weeks\nStraight then you know that she probably won't need the bike guard OK\nOkay and I have a question I have to clean up clean has that problem and I had a stomach or they must have taught for spicy for stomach hot\nOkay we'll have spicy food or for certain body types the ... body types like pit that are hard for them to handle so I wouldn't I wouldn't\nOr meat fish poultry eggs it may be very difficult to have this ph where it belongs and when it's not there then it's very common that wheel grind our teeth so I Would keep the by guard until you can see a first morning here in the age\nThat holds for a good two three four weeks\nStraight then you know that she probably won't need the bike guard OK\nOkay I have a question I have to clean up clean has that and I have a stomach or they must have taught for spicy for stomach hot\nOkay

Nineteen fifties from the work done by the Pasteur Institute in France that these are the result the acme is a result of disordered bacterial ecology of the gut and it's very hard to fix it\nBut if she is steadfast she can get on to something like garlic aside and to break the tough little bio films that are in the ... how much does she weigh in how old is she\nAnd her name fifty five\nO K so what you would want to do here is have about two to three girl aside and per meal and that will help to break any of these bio films that are in the guts and then you'd want her to have some kind of a good\nProbiotic to take in this case the you wouldn't want to like you get our robotic it's in a ... being capsules all you have to do a swallow it\nAnd that will target the large intestine and that's
