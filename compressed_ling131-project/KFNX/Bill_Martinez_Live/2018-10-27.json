helping inflammatory response but it's one of the oil is that the kidneys really needs\nAnd at your age and wait I Would take about ten of those and capsules chewing suck out all the oil spill 'em out if you like and I would do that at your high protein meal and I would do that for maybe three months at the end of the time you should know that you feed a great\nThen you will cut down to maybe three to five kept as a maintenance okay\nThe other thing I Would do is go on kidneys support and the jury sides about three per meal\nAnd what you should see is almost an immediate support for that area within two three four days okay now the question becomes have used sustained as serious blow to your low back your pelvis you're as I joined the fact that both feeders swollen\nWorries me that you've

Do have a some pains in my lower back legs and feet well that\nDoesn't necessarily mean as an interference field there the pain and you're back in ... feet in my estimation the most common thing is that you're not getting enough minerals so you can get a roller ph paper and you can tell it's\nYour first morning urine ph you tear off a little piece pass it through the stream and it should go green\nThat's the color you looking for six point four to seven point or if it's blue you're in a moment you're you're an emergency how close is your super low and minerals as soon as you start minerals it'll go yellow about five and then it'll work its way back up and if you can't get it back up then you visit with someone\nIn your area there in Chicago there's a number of people and

I saw it up anyway so I I feel like I become that\n[laughter] yeah it's called the forced march I understand completely\nOK okay take them by now All right\nLet's go right back to the phones to go to Audrey in San jose and she's got a dad who's bone on bone in the right hip supposedly\nAre you there Audrey yes I Am how old is your dad and how much does he way\nSeventy five years old any land line\nOkay well here's what you need to know Audrey that\nHalf the time when they say that it's not true and the there's an underlying issue even if let's just assume for a minute it's true and they want to do a hip replacement the process that caused him to lose the bone\nIs unchanged so why would we think that a trauma like a hip replacement whatever he'll\nSee this is some kind of lunatic thinking that we have that it's very scary to me so the first thing you need to do for your dad is to get a roller ph paper and by the way of you do this Audrey you're blessed yourself\nLearn how to do this and you can have many many super healthy years\nSo first you get a roller ph paper and because of his age I Would not use ... trio but if you're a lot younger you could use ph trail it's cheaper but he would have to go on super nutrient trio where you would get our quantum greens mix and\nHe'd have to use maybe two to three tablespoons in a smoothie of the quantum greens to get enough to have the minerals he needs to push the ph into the ideals zone six four to seven oh\nAnd when you get there you'll be the healthiest and as long as you can stay there you will have the longest best life\nOkay and if you can get him there and it's going to be more of a fight for him because it's Seventy five he's producing zero in the way of digestive enzymes so we need to do here is put him on some of them\nHis age I Would not use ... trio but if you're a lot younger you could use ph trail it's cheaper but he would have to go on super nutrient trio where he would get our quantum greens mix and he'd have to use maybe two to three tablespoons in a smoothie\nOf the quantum greens to get enough to have the minerals he needs to push the ph into the ideals zone six four to seven oh\nAnd when you get there you'll be the healthiest and as long as you can stay there you will have the longest best life\nOkay and if you can get him there and it's going to be more of a fight for him because it's Seventy five he's producing zero in the way of digestive enzymes\nSo we need to do here is put him on some of them died just maybe two of those and at the end of the meals some detained Hedrick so right about four of those now is adjusting that we did in his twenties\nNow sometimes the ah had record gadget will cause burning and he won't like it\nThat they occur is if there's a trauma from the forehead to the big bone on the center line\nIf there is good for you know before he can get someone to mud back and eliminate that what he can do is take some stomach support\nAnd he would just take two capsules of that and make it as a tea drink it before he eats now stomach so on will be no burning from the age sale okay so no more rotting food we fixed that we give him enough minerals so we could push\nThe ph and so what could go wrong well the parents that road which controls the hormones for\nThe bone metabolism could be in trouble from a specially mixed dental restoration like a silver filling in a crown all the junk that many people have in their mouth so here you might have to use a couple of teaspoons of green tea PG\nTo get that guided test on and you may have to support kidney usually all we have to do with kidney is get them on some the age ... and maybe on may be five the caps at his main protein meal he can chew 'em and spit them out\nAnd now you've got all the ingredients needed to push the ph if he's still getting the ph you may have infection in gum may have a dead too that maybe something else going on and then what you would do is call the or the line get the number of a cue or a practitioner up there\nGet him over there will be able to test them find out what it is and get it fixed and in the same price as if you do this you will stay younger stronger healthier longer you'll have the most wonderful life and if\nThat ph crashes and you can't get it back up then you run to a cue or a practitioner who will get it back up you don't let yourself take a rocket sled ride to a graveyard\nOkay we'll say oh\nYou're welcome and if you couldn't catch all that you call the over the line and ah just tell him that you're Audrey from San jose and they can review everything\nFor you okay okay thank you You're welcome okay All right\nIs Dr Bob Marshall pitch Davis is help line line I Want to continue here with uh our discussion of the kidney and flew to addicts system and of course memory and brain function and of course these essential fatty acids\nYou'll have the most wonderful life and if that ph crashes and you can't get it back up then you run to a cue or a practitioner who will get it back up you don't let yourself take a rocket sled ride to a graveyard\nOK\nYou're welcome and if you couldn't catch all that you call the on the line and just tell him that you're Audrey from San jose and they can review everything\nFor you okay okay thank you You're welcome okay All right\nThis is Dr Bob Marshall pitch Davis is health one line I Want to continue here with uh our discussion of the kidney and flew to addicts system and of course\nMemory and brain function and of course these at Central fatty acids we've been talking about before\nEssential being the key word you're not going to be healthy from an elderly person to a baby without having\nThese wonderful critical essential fatty acids my most favorite of course his ... two hundred because it's a macro algae has sores so it's the clean is\nA least sores for any kind of weird heavy metal or PC bees it's literally free of these so it's a wonderful clean source\nAnd the ... has been also shown to be critical for maintaining healthy brain volume cognition and memory and of course being plants shores it's okay for you vegetarians as well\nAnd what else does the brain need though as we age well some of you may be down the road a bit and memory in concentration of very poor and ... a while it's going to be critical to maintain you and may help you\nYou're going to want more and the more it can be our quantum ribs ferret drawl\nOr because of this guy is great for brain health for overall energy it's one of the best antioxidants\nAnd it helps to clear or the bio accumulated junk DNA in the cell it promotes healthy DNA strand production and it actually can activate one of the keys to an anti aging jeans\nSo this guy is a real important when so red beret Jerome\nAn also have our big gun which is brain support and this is of course live sores rained formulation for superior brain processing performance and clarity and it contains all the key components for ideal brain function\nAnd it can also help you to target nutrition to the brain so like you're taking deejay with it can help to concentrate more than ... brain if that's what you need and for some of you they'll be associated neurological issues not just brain issues\nWith it can help to concentrate more than ... brain if that's what you need and for some of you they'll be associated neurological issues not just brain issues\nWell the first thing that you want to know because you're approaching the age where you can't just hardly anything in the way of cooked food so obviously your first step to reducing the irritation Indian testing is to make sure you can digest your food\nSo you would get on one of them died just to maybe take a couple of those at the start of the meal\nThe end of the meal about for the ... right\nNow you're digesting more like you did in your twenties and this shouldn't be any rotting food\nHitting the got now but the next step we have to look at is certain foods are more irritating than others\nCorn is one of those super irritate her show you'd want to get rid of corn and you'll want to add vitamin D three or we call it the three gold and maybe about six drops of this\nIn about one ounce of water and you would mix in that about four drops of lime and then now that's an essential oil of orange\nAnd it will uh most if I the D three so you mix it really good in the water and you see the big droplets of the three become tiny tiny now you know no matter what the state of your gall bladder you're going to absorb this this has been shown to promote\nThe best response to all of the\nKnown immune fractions two hundred plus immune fractions of body makes and it has been shown to be very helpful for all new coach so this may be just the kind of thing that you need Susan to get back to track now it's possible\nIf you're seeing candy to that you have a bug in the intestine\nAnd even doing these things you may still see some irritation if that's true then you really need to visit with someone who's mastered clinical nutrition\nSomebody who knows Q. R A quantum reflex analysis they're going to be able to test the balance and see if there's a bug or something else that needs to be attended to in the intestine and if you call the airline they can give you the number of people uh hopefully somewhere near you in New York\nOkay thank you I what I thought the fiber like ground screen criticizing the collapse job\nWell remember those little shooters you just got the big shoot\nJust the kind of thing that you need Susan to get back to track now it's possible\nIf you're seeing candied is it you have a bug in the intestine\nAnd even doing these things you may still see some irritation if that's true then you really need to visit with someone who's mastered clinical nutrition\nSomebody who knows cue or a quantum reflex analysis they're going to be able to test about let's see if there's a bug or something else that needs to be attended to in the intestine and if you call the ... they can give you the number of people uh hopefully somewhere near you in New York\nOkay thank you what are your thoughts about fiber like brown rice grain criticizing the collapse job\nWell remember those are little shooters you just got the big shooter which is vitamin D three now ... is a stand in immune system and if you get a good quality wanted scot free form demeanor glob village\nAnd the the guys that fight the battle first in the intestine so yes a collage from may be a real help\nWhat else did you ask about nuclear type newsletter\nThat I can also the glutamate of course is one of the foods for the bow lining but if we're going to go there the best way to go probably is to go with um fiber immune Rapinoe go acting is the active ingredient and\nThis guy from ... to ... the food for the lining of the intestine so all along the intestine this is gonna feed every cell there so if we're thinking the glue to mean I think this is a better way to go\nAnd you take just one or will it your body as I'd probably use two tablespoons\nYou can mix Senate and the smoothie if you want you could take it in the morning or afternoon\nBut that would be my favorite but start with the basics so many people Dr Robert canal at UCLA has shown just about everybody is vitamin D deficient and if that's the case you know your your you know trying to put some to ACT UP with a sledgehammer\nLet's go back to the basics and if the basics don't do it by all means you can always add the other Asia's okay\nThey three for starters hand held\n... with the linemen and digest NHL that's your stark\nOkay okay I meant by the way my check your favorites which I Love that takes a lot that oh\nWell because of the fact that it's a sort of a probe addicts suspension you can take him anywhere but usually we recommend you take 'em half the breakfast earlier in the day because that's when you'll be able to use them the most\nOf it and I think I sit on it like out of\nThat will be fine that's even better if you are willing to do that\n[laughter] it doesn't matter if I had food and my stomach you know it does now how can I ask is how much better or right\nThis is Dr Bob Marshall pitch said this is health one in line\nFor
