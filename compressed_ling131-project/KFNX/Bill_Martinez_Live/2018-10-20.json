weeks\nAnd if you see that it's\nSteadily better and better I Would carry this out for about six to eight weeks and then stop a lord willing that promotes the best structure and function for the

a very old injury usually to the say cruel area and fall\nYes yes and so you need to find someone who knows puree quantum reflex analysis and knows the latest in mud packing cold ice packs and they can pack that say grill area get it to test on\nAnd then you could get yourself a very cheap\nSet of water called walk fits from target or any of these places\nThere are about twenty bucks and don't

[laughter]\nHowever I have no financial axe to grind decay which is quite different so I agree that there could be a circulatory issue\nI don't agree that the circulatory issues solution is necessarily that surgery it may be that he played sports and he's had his incurred an interference field an injury to his low back\nOr to the ... for it to the tail bones that is the dating the normal energy flow through that area and the first thing that should be done is to look for that because what will happen if you do the surgery is you will now for sure\nHave at least one major interference field\nIf not to the second one being from his childhood or adolescence from some kind of injury so uh if you're in Modesto would I Would do is\nGreed that there could be a circulatory issue I don't agree that the circulatory issues solution is necessarily that surgery it\nMay be that he played sports\nAnd he's had his incurred an interference field an injury to his low back or to the ... for it

field\nIf there is let's mud pack the darn thing let's get him on something called delta boost to promote\nThe best circulation it may be two per day and also get him on a obviously short few gold to\nSee if we can promote the circulation without a knife and a simple retail ... of the sperm will tell you this his work do you need about a six week time I suspect you're young and have plenty of time and you really don't want him chopped up if he doesn't need to be\nA way I think well\nYeah I'm not sure that's necessary I've dealt with a number of these and in I'm I've been doing this over forty years and I can tell you that I've dealt with maybe a hundred disease and\nCannot recall one that was not an interference field so almost fishery latest sport he took a whack he fell in his bike he did some dumb thing and it's Twenty years later or whatever and the interference field has had enough time to make a real mess\nOkay thinking\nThat he's also right that could be born with it however if he was born with it it would be unlikely that he would have hardly anything in the way of sperm till it and\nHe is two percent so that he could be right about that I don't want to diminish that that is positive but if you were born with it it's still an interference field\nAs far as I tell her the climate everything is great except for college and the shape of the actual federal fell out that I'm a tech yes\nThere is one of the things that can help and it's called royal jelly okay\nAnd you can call you at all and they will have that he will need that his buddies there's probably need to use about but tease from the day\nAfter the quake or how much\nI Would use about three per meal just for the six week period to see if that does the job and then we're retesting six weeks and

we've been paying attention is to hold the morning you were in the edge in the Green Zone six forty seven too if you can do that you're in great physiology to have a baby OK than if you can't do that you'd better hurry up and get their\nCars not going to be fun if you're losing bone and you have the baby you're going to have a rough run\nOkay All right to take care of how will come back I\nThis is Dr Bob Marshall pitch the this is health line live and ran spring your nutrition and health related calls you reaches toll free eight eighty eight\nFive eighty eight Seventy five Seventy six the next thing that we wanted to covered today is\nOf the prostate because this also plays a very key role in mail help and there's been so much research and information regarding\nThe prostate but basically the first step to promote the best health for the urinary tract to end the ... is pollen floor to promote its best to help\nAnd if there's no improvement or not enough improvement there than there was no reason to not go on to something stronger like our products they support which provides the best support I haven't been able to find on the planet for the prostate and the urinary tract in men\nAnd here you might go to two or three per meal depending on how big a person you are\nAnd this guy you you need thirty to sixty days to see if it's working well but um this is the best combination of nutrients support for the prostate I've been able to find so I think that can be another really really great age\nI Do think that like opinion which would come from\nTomato and tomato concentrates a male she'll be of help for the prostate\nAnd uh we have a product called quantum tomato that's just loaded with like opinion it's one of the nicest ways to get like opinion and for many of you who consume a good bit of tomatoes that may not be the player or you may need prostate support\nSo what else can affect the the prostate will\nPut some of you on medications which May of induced a process they challenge magnesium males so be helpful but there are many many of you out there that have had injuries to the head or to the upper or lower front for teeth these points\nThey're really really great age I Do think that like opinion which would come from tomato and tomato concentrates a male to be of help for the prostate\nAnd uh we have a product called quantum tomato that's just loaded with like opinions one of the nicest ways to get like opinion and for many of you who consume a good bit of tomatoes that may not be the player or you may need products they support\nSo what else can affect the the prostate will\nPut some of the ... on medications which many of them do a process they challenge magnesium also be helpful but there are many many of you out there that have had injuries to the head or to the upper or lower front for tea\nThese points may reflects directly to the prostate or you've had at the sec to me or a hernia surgery and\nA few years later you're experiencing issues with prostate this is the interference field in something you definitely want to deal with\nBecause each four or five years to go buy it just keeps getting worse and worse and interference field or scarred traumas that are sitting there helping Andrew floated the key organ or Glenn\nAnd their unrelenting slow but unrelenting nutrients can slow them down but nothing did stop some so you want to get a mud back then get rid of him to\nDo that you visit someone who knows ... just give a bus tour or the line\nAnd they can give you the number of someone and are they going to help you with today's special or prostate support and our quantum tomato which is really a great tasting player on the block\nJust give us ... eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven to eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven lived school rate bank to the phones here who had to go to\nLive in Milwaukee and she's just did some immunity issues and vision issues ever since she started having these ah immunity issues are right are you there Lynn\nYes I Am how old woman or even how much do we have\nSixty six years old I weigh ... pounds\nOr ... well the first thing you want to know is the main reason your immune system's crept out you can visit with things you had as a child\nIs because you can't just your food so\nLet me just say I I think I've seen every day six days a week in my life schedule around your radio program and every thing is I forget where it and I have not been trying to\nKilling a girl and I was\nLike you know the healthier sixty six year old or younger in my class for like four years ever since I've been standing on getting everything got ph screen it took me forever to it but I'm I'm ... several months now and I'm doing great\nAnd I was like you know the healthier sixty six year old or younger in my dad size class for like four years ever since I've been standing on getting everything you say I've got ph green it took me forever to do it but I'm I'm ... several months\nIn America we're manufacturing these and we cannot manufactured to the purity of precision that they can at this time\nSo that is why and what I'm going to say to you Richard is you try our as if you don't think it's the best year ever reuse return it will give you a refund but I'm going to tell you once you get it you're hooked [laughter]\nProtocol that has a few of them with like the first\nOne or two died just at the start of a meal even if you forget and take it at the end works almost as good in the end you would take a couple of age CEO and you know that it's working because there'll be no ... on your teeth and\nIf you have black on your deep you know you have low Hedrick Oric as it or the other problem we have is we pass forty and that includes you is that we're facing a real gall bladder crises in America everybody has something going on with their ...\nAnd what we have the news is that much of it is from eating highly heated\nOils in any food cooked over the boiling point first of all their lives it's a massive white cell response so it's going to make you tired right away 'cause you won't have any red cells left which is what gives you energy but\nAlso the body is chasing these because it sees them as a problem and meal after meal we do these things plus we're getting large amounts of oil is that we can't just well so if I were you I Would take a Ninety day holiday\nFrom all of the olive oil salad with oil and it just used vinegar coconut oil anything loaded with oil any food just take a holiday and see what wonderful things happened to your body and get on\nSome gall bladder PG and\nAt your body weight and maybe about three to four teaspoons and use this for about four months even if the terrible gas is not from there

Green Zone six point four to seven point no so long as you can do that you know you got great health great physiology okay\nThanks so much for it yeah I really appreciate it take care of\nAll right this is about Marshall PHD this is helpline live let's go right back to the phones let's go to Harry in Miami and uh he's concerned about his mom who's having some low back issues are you there hairy\nDog in a a a call about my mom she either out for an hour five Laura I'm bar ... company they come ... ... ... the fad it around shutting down\nVery an unpleasant yep how old a woman and she and how much does she weigh\n... ... ...\nOkay so the first thing you need to know is that\nAlmost for sure she's in bone loss and guaranteed eighty three eighty six\nShe cannot digest your food without having digestive enzymes support so before she eats a single thing she should be taking one of them died just\nAnd toward the end of the meal about\nTwo or even three but teen Hedrick Laura right now she'll be adjusting more like she did in their twenties the next step is to get her minerals better and the way we're going to do that\nIs to get her on something called Bowman joined support here you'll probably need to use\nAbout three caps for meal and you're going to need even more in the way of minerals so I Would make her a smoothie\nMaybe in the afternoon and then the smoothie we could put two or three tablespoons of greens mix\nQuantum grains is what the product is called\nAnd that's loaded with minerals that won't stress her kidneys like regular minerals because at her age I'm sure that could be an issue as well now with these things done she can get something called the hang up\nThis is a devise where you step into it and it can invert you when we have a problem like this you do not want to win Vert completely there's a strap on the machine that can restrict it so that you only invert forty five degrees\nAnd her goal would be ten minutes that means Fifteen times she would do twenty seconds erect twenty seconds inverted and that it\nTablespoons of greens mix quantum greens is what the product is called\nAnd that's loaded with minerals that won't stress her kidneys like regular minerals because at her age I'm sure that could be an issue as well now with these things done she can get something called the hang up\nThis is a devise where you step

her goal would be ten minutes\nThat means Fifteen times she would do twenty seconds erect twenty seconds inverted\nAnd ... is that the data K. to hang up yes it is exactly that\nAnd yet I I that's why I call 'cause I wanted to know if I could put at five or heroin that\nYes you can but remember you don't want her to fully invert yet because those two vertebrae may not be able to handle that\nAnd what you wanted to do is ... the spinal fluid you can achieve that not as good but you can achieve that by restricting hurt to forty five degrees OK\nYeah thought that I bought one from you add it actually I have it at a forty five degree\nAngle now you need to do it morning and night okay\nRight right right on that night last night but I have a increase at the market and\nThen we have to do it both trust me okay dot\nDot quiet and and what what do I do for a nation like why did very humid down here which is almost every day she she has a lot of pain go to the information on arthritis in fact\nWell remember the first step is to stop rotting food\nFrom getting into the system that's why the digestion is so important in the bone and joint are compounds that promote healthy inflammatory response in that area a these are things you can do immediately\nThere could be we could do more adding da ... ten for a day at her main meal she could just two days and spit out the capsule or swallow them\nWhen these are taken in ... amount of five or more uh they promote healthy inflammatory response so you can do a little more for her that way there's even more that can be done\nWhat I Would say is you start here and if you want more give a bus to the or the line to visit with someone who is mastered cure a quantum reflex analysis\nThey're going to be able to test her pinpoint exactly what else she needs\nOkay [noise] okay [noise] I've I thank you very much good talking to you know thinking okay\nThis is talk about Marshall pitch day this is held one in line oven or

because it's literally every aspect of the immune system depends on vitamin D three [noise]\nAnd if that's not enough all the mucus membranes depend on it from the lungs all the way through to the intestines and the prostate\nThey all depend on vitamin D three so be sure that you get on our deep three gold and if you're over forty forty or over you ought to add Lyman with it so that you can be sure it's fully multiplied and easy to absorb\nAnd that guy will help across the board for the bladder the prostate the lungs everybody\nBut do remember the lungs are your back up to the large
