how much will come back to live when you take it so I Lived sores products don't have that problem\nThe second problem you have is that if the capsule or the delivery system breaks down in the small intestine\nThen the odds of the anaerobic organisms like bitter do making it to the large intestine are very poor so the capsule would need to be a very space age capsule\nIn other words it would need to have the apps adopt fellows product in a capsule that would liberate in the stomach and small intestine\nAnd the bits that old products being micro encapsulated so they would deliver into the large intestine\nWhat we have is they are a product that is all lives shores and it's in an ... bean capsule so that means if you want to target the mouth and the upper GI\nYou choose a capsule and on to target the large intestine you swallow the capsule\nSo ... that says ah it won gold medal awards in Japan many years ago and to me it's kind of the gold standard of pro by Arctic and you need to remember many people are taking probiotics\nBecause the gut Flora is a ... from not being able to digest the food so the probiotic is a band aid and it's never going to really get the help they're

for over thirty five years\nHe thinks that's only helps more than fifty thousand people that's why he's now in the ... and that really works\nAnd he's here today to share nutritional secret which had taken years didn't cover and like she can come and go down in their own health Sunni Dr Marshall recommend that almost all life story three is questionable and calculating agent\nEverything you can think of goes wrong so the first thing you want to do is get him on some digestive support probably to quantum died just at the start of the main meal yes for him because of his age\nAnd then at the end of the meal you want to start with to between ... and maybe if he tolerates that will go to for if he gets any burning or any problem with the age she um just him drink a lot of water it'll stop but\nLike I face that fact to what they are going to digest\nOh okay\nSo now with the HDL if he has any negative reaction you may have to stop get some stomach support\nAnd have him make a T beforehand or with two capsules and you can do that before each main meal and then the digest and aid shell work perfectly until you have time to visit with someone who knows ... and they can\nFind the interference field should sit dating stomach\nPacket and then you will need systemic support anymore\nThat makes a gang fight yeah yes ... okay\nWell I guess we'll just your main meal yet somehow okay All right and now to support his gall bladder what we need to do here is get on to something called gall bladder PG\nAnd add to hear that body weight and age about three cheese balloons and you mix is in maybe six ounces of water and drink\nHand or with two capsules and he can do that before each main meal and then the digest NHL work perfectly until you have time to visit with someone who knows cue or a and they can find the interference field should sit dating stomach\nPacket and then you will need systemic support any more\nGang fight yeah yes ... ... cap the well just your main meal is somehow\nOkay All right and now to support his gall bladder what we need to do here is get on to something called gall bladder PG\nAnd add to hear that body weight and age about three teased foods and you're mixed is in maybe six ounces of water and drink it after breakfast K. and he's going to use this for about four months\nNow he has two choices he can do after three weeks he can start to coffee enemies\nPer week or if he doesn't want to do that and men resist is like the play he can he can go on the battlefield diet and the mayor is is that even more but uh that would be the biggest help for him\nAnd then typically you wouldn't need to do the coffee animas and you can see even at his age just a spectacular change that the body can produce it only knows how to be well\nYou got to send it in the right direction the battlefield that of course will reduce those gold medals load that has made a mess to begin with OK\nOkay All right so\nYou're welcome by them\nRight let's is docked about Marshall pitch Davis has health line live and were answering your\nNutrition and health related questions you reaches toll free\nEight eighty eight five eighty eight Seventy five Seventy six you visited San\nLine un labs dot com be sure until a friend and a half of them joined us as welders prior broadcasts out there all the radio listening times in much more so by all means have them join us and joined us during the week Monday through friday we've got a half hour show you can see it there and\nUsually a lot easier to get through with your questions as well to end labs dot com\nAnd today we're talking about hair skin and nails and so we we'd be remiss if we didn't talk a little bit about blemishes than on cystic acne you know a is acne issue is something that is a been traced by the Pasteur Institute way back in the Nineteen fifties\nTo disordered bacterial ecology and of course the Pasteur Institute tried probiotics to ah help correct this the u._s. tried antibiotics and of course neither word\nAnd one of the reasons of course we've had to learn is the micro biome which is almost got a mind of its own it's the bacterial\nUh ecology of or a gun is really dug in to the lining of the intestine\nAnd there's just no place for a new comer of a probiotic to set up housekeeping show we've got to make some room for it and unfortunately what we've found is that sticky polysaccharides or sugary sex\nCan exist in the intestine and especially when you haven't been breastfed especially when\nTruly college game and of course the Pasteur Institute tried probiotics to ah help correct this the U. S. dried antibiotics and of course neither work\nAnd one of the reasons of course we've had to learn is the micro biome which is almost got a mind of its own it's bacterial\nUh ecology of our gun is really dug in to the lining of the intestine and there's just no place for\nA new comer of a probiotic to set up housekeeping show we've got to make some room for it and unfortunately what we've found is that sticky polysaccharides or sugary sex\nCan exist in the intestine and especially when you haven't been breastfed especially when there's been a long term antibiotic use and especially when there's been food poisoning or parasitic infections\nAnd so the intestine may have these sticky fill me bio films and they've glued on to the intestine or any mucus membrane harder than dried mucus and you know it was so they're really they're really got a death grip\nAnd we're the only thing we found that can really help\nThe body unglued these things and clear the air is so a probiotic can get in and ... has been a form of garlic the active fraction Allison we call it garlic aside and and\nIt's effective but gentle bio film buff strict and it breaks the mile films in the guts and allows the good bacteria\nTo host so now when we take a probiotic it can do some good but this process\nIs a slow process it may take a year or two because that got micro biome is an extraordinarily protective ah environment meant to keep you healthy but really what it does is keep you wherever you are\nAnd so the move is slow move but it can be a wonderful movie so jumping on some garlic side and and some really good probiotic like our probiotics support\nAnd swallowing those because they're in a low because being a capsule and if you choose and they'd be liberating the probiotic for the mouth and the upper GI\nBut when you swallow on them they have the ... effect and target the large intestine so that can be just great help for dealing with the acne and topic leading not much of anything works because the problem is really systemic\nAlso it's important to understand that the fried foods and sugars can actually make the acme words\nAnd [laughter] ah one of the things we can do is try to more effectively digest and absorb those foods\nSo we can jump on in addition to our quantum died just some quantum zions which of course are designed to promote a further a breakdown of gluten amino acids and sugars on the bow aligning itself\nSo today we will have our garlic siding probiotics ship for it\nAnd want those arms on special by to get twenty five percent off each just give a buzz ... eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven or eight hundred\nFried foods and sugars can actually make the acme words\nAnd [laughter] ah one of the things we can do is try to more effectively digest\nAnd absorb those foods so we can jump on in addition to our quantum died just some quantum zions which of course are designed to promote a further a breakdown of gluten amino acids and sugars on the bowel lining itself\nSo today we will have our garlic siding probiotic support\nAnd want them zone arms on special by to\nGet twenty five percent off each just give a buzz ... eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven to eight hundred three Seventy\nThirty four forty seven alright let's go right back to the phones let's go to Deborah in Beaverton, Oregon and she's got advanced or a sphere ferocious and this is almost a nationwide epidemic are you there Deborah\nYes I Am and how old woman or even how much you weigh I'm sixty four Atlanta hiring thirty four\nWell the first thing I Want to tell you is I Believe this is a hundred percent fixable so our first step\nWould be to get a roller ph paper and I don't know what state your kidneys or in whether you get leg swelling or\nAny pain or any your show I Know I get half kidneys are good for the case then you can't be able to jump on the edge trail and\nYou should also be able to take about\nFor bone and joins support these are for six phone and for a few ferocious um has has all the players that the body needs so our goal of course is to get the first morning you were in ph into the Green Zone\nExploit four to seven point out now the three ... tour is number one kidney number to Paris I read most common\nAnswer ferrets arid we can usually get it it just on with a couple of ... ... if you'd kidneys are good we won't even go there\nThen we'll start checking every three days and see if we can move this ph usually when you're severely honesty of product\nIf ph will actually showed blew\nA which means uh the body is producing ammonia the mineral status is so poor so so what happens is in within a couple of days it crashes down to orange around five and then it starts working its way out\nAnd if we don't have any infection anywhere it works its way up beautifully\nIf we have infection will get closed and it'll balance in and out it won't hold\nAnd there you might have gum infection you might have did choose you may have some other problem and if that's the case\nAnd now they won't hold and there you might have gum infection you might as it did choose you may have some other problem and if that's the case\nAnd then you can cut to two at breakfast only okay\nThen the other thing we've got to do to make sure that it's not rotting food that's waking you up is to get you on digestive support and had her for a gas it so maybe to quantum died just at the start of your main meal and then the end of the meal about four\nTo five detain hydro chloride now you're digesting more like you did as a twenty year old\nSo now I think this should be a tremendous help the lack of sleep\nWill cause you to excrete magnesium which can tend to make the intestines and the bows much harder so you could jump on some of our magnesium four hundred and take a couple of teaspoons a morning and night for\nProbably five days and now you should start having very easy to pass by movements\nAnd then I Would cut two um two teaspoons am only okay\nAnd I think it should doing his job for you a lot of people tell me at your age so that they prefer a teaspoon morning and night\nRather than taking it all at once in the day because you're still screening chill we rebuild those adrenal 's okay [noise] I Hope that's a big help for you and your and take care of by now\nRight this is asked about Marshall Fitz
