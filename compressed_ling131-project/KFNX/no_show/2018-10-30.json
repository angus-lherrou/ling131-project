people so the first thing I thought was\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one I used to tell people in Jewish centers you should have an armed guard\nThe men should learn how to use weapons\nAnd the answer is I Would get would make my stomach turn\nAnd they have no sense of survival none none\nNone no sense of self preservation of survival you have no idea what it's like talking to people who are so foolish\nAnd the Israelis though I'm right\nMany many people I've known 'em right with the churches in America many churches and are protected by armed guards but to a progressive the idea of using a policeman\nAn off duty policeman or an armed guard is such anathema they would rather see people defenseless them protected because they don't want to be seen as politically on the side of those of us who understand the power of protection of guns afford us\nSo none other than the lunatic of lunatics to ... in New York\nTo say no guns and needed\nListen to clip six and you'll hear the minds of a

was Jews who I've noted defend themselves\nIt was that the police with guns Mr devise neo\nWho went in and stop them it wasn't you with your foul mouth\nIt was cops with guns some of whom got shot shame on you to ...\nFor the basing the police for doing this incredible job\nThey were the ones who tracked him to a little room where he was hiding and they were the ones who got this cowardly

question\nWhat is it a lousy you're talking about what do you mean\nWho's normalizing hate\nWas saying protect the people\nPut a policeman in as they're not what we do with schools now remember what happened in Florida with that tower the cop who hid behind those pillars remember him\nHe was actually in the school to protect the children when that guy came in with a gun was hiding behind the pills he's still I think I should point out\nThe cop should be in prison\nWho ran away these cops should be invited to the White House which they will be\nOne of them are still in the hospital because

now guard are now Moses excuse me as we look into the text is pending she for his father or working for his father in law\nBut he came from a different place at a different time but where he is that now seems a little different and maybe just maybe Moses wasn't too happy with where he was that\nAgain let's look at the life of Moses motives was a Hebrew child safe from that from the hands of federal\nExodus chapter one or two by being put into a basket that was fixed the flow and placed in the river Nile\nThen while federal is daughter was at the riverbank she saw the basket and the water and found the boy image so she named him Moses meaning drew out so young Moses grow up in the house of federal\nBut he also knew he was a Hebrew\nSo he went to see these people and saw in Hebrew man being beaten and Moses killed the Egyptian man that was harassing the Hebrew so Moses Ryan comedian in the desert\nSo now we see in chapter ... motives has now gone from frames so she keeper\nWent to all he could want to live on the line\nTonight we might think that there is a place we need to be\nBut not the one I'm at right now may be the place we're at right now may be spiritually you don't like what is your Iraq maybe even physically you don't like where you're at right now but Moses needed to learn something we need to learn and also\n\nWhat three things that we see an exodus chapter one\n\nI'm trying to ... extra chapter one extra chapter cream first one in six\nMoses was reading the sheep before you can leave people you must learn how to start with small teams also before you can lead man you must deal with something just has stubborn\nMoses was dealing with something\nOr an animal that was very stubborn a sheep now sheep are not the most smartest of the animal breed you see one she go off a cliff odds are another couple will follow\nThat is the same thing what else we could be the most intelligent person in the world but sometimes we followed them wrong influence\nThe wrong person the wrong thing and some times in order to be a leader we have to start with the most stubbornness person or thing and that sometimes is ourself\n\nOr other people like family members or whatever the situation there's motors have to start small before he can leave a multitude of people the Bible says that they're strongest Israel was over maybe a million people\nShe wants she go off a cliff odds are another couple will follow\nThat is the same thing what else we could be the most intelligent person in the world but sometimes we followed them wrong influence\nThe wrong person the wrong thing and some times in order to be a leader we have to start with the most stubbornness person or thing and that sometimes is ourself\n\nOr other people like family members or whatever the situation is mold is added to start small before he can leave a multitude of people the Bible says that they're strongest Israel was over maybe a million people on their way out of Egypt\n\nYou must deal with some doing just how stubborn yourself you gotta deal with yourself first before you could leave anybody else\n\nPut off your channel put put yourself in the sandals on Moses I was rich fad grooming in the best that Egypt the world has to offer\nBut now researchers are less food is not what I like but it will do\nAnd if I get a bat it wouldn't hurt sometimes we must learn that God is all we mean if we live like princes how then what I Know how how would a beggar feels\nHow the less fortunate person feels I can only tell you from my experience I've been blessed I've had Richard and I've had nothing\nBut all in all God remain the same Moses had to come from his high place of standing has a shot of federal as the son of Egypt and be removed from all that and come through a place of a lonely she partner living in a desert\n\nMaybe it wasn't the best circumstance for Moses buddy was that the place Scott won the beach maybe you need to examine your life and she is this what God wants me to be\nMaybe I don't have much but what I Do have God has given it to me maybe I might not have all that I read about God has given me enough maybe I might not be happy with the job on main order life ... maybe I'm not happy what even the Chinese chow Maine but I Am where God wants me to be\n\nMoses number two Moses had to live in the desert for forty years because you would have to bring a great number out\nYeah not happy what even the Chinese chow man but I Am where God wants me to be\n\nMoses number two Moses had to live in the desert for forty years because he would have to bring a great number out of it Moses would have never been able to lead anyone from anything unless first\nI've done too many things wrong I keep coming close to God but I keep failing [noise] I don't fit\nThe model will be the next leader of this generation that help people get out of addiction to help people get out of trouble to help people get out of their messy situation Moses didn't fit the model either he was a privilege bully you had the best that Egypt has to offer you was raised in the lap of luxury\nBut yet he saw his people struggling and he thought he could do it himself so he ended up murdering a man and one on the run\nFrom the law so I'm pretty sure that Moses was not the best guy\n\nBut God saw something in Moses\nThat he didn't see it himself\nHe saw a man that could deliver people a man that could help gouge people come to the place the problem is maybe you might not see yourself in that area but I Believe dog she's you has a man or woman of deliverance a man who could bring people into the place a problem is like Moses brought to people\nOr the Moses how to use you know\nThe most is make mistakes yes she did was most is the most well known the Bible says that he had a starter or a speech impediment of some sort and couldn't speak well and have to have his brother Aaron speak for him\nSo maybe you might not speak to the baby you might not speak as well as you should\nMaybe you don't fit the model may be\nYou're too skinny maybe get too fat maybe you're too short maybe here to talk whatever you think is not right with God sees you as a future most cheese you have to deliver of people again something that things about if a God can use the men might Moses\nWho didn't fit the model for a man to help bring people out of being kept his team ship then why won't\nI let the audience me are you letting guardians you make that choice today you have to answer that you have to give yourself that answer if God could use Moses why can he\nThe baby you might not speak as well as you should\nMaybe you don't fit the model may be you're too skinny maybe you're too fat maybe you're too short maybe too tall whatever you think is not right with God sees you\nAs a future Mose she's you have to deliver a people again something to think about if a God can use the men might Moses who didn't fit the model\nFor a man to help bring people out of being captive to Egypt\nThen why won't I let the audience me\nAre you letting guardians you make that choice today you have to answer that you have to give yourself that answer if God could use Moses why can't he while when I was amused me\nSomething to pray about today this week as you go before your day to day life maybe you should be praying about this is there anything in my life that is stopping my steps are being holy if ten\n\nIt's ten I Need to pray daily to God to make the steps I think ...\nIf there's anything in your life hindering steps holding you up there is any sandals on your feet that are stopping you from feeling the holy presidents of God from coming to the ground changing please God wants you to be\nThen you need to pray about it I got

watching or my shin my chin would be healed in a pouch and you were covering might guilt now what's the joke saying here's this my steps are flawed\nI have sin but you're not watching those things if

I've ever heard in my life and it's coming from one of their stinking as people in Congress this creep Schiff has the nerve to say\nThat these attacks on Soros are driven largely by his Jewish right

nation's identity\nThere one world order new world order people those to having a son\nSo don't confuse the two\nAnd here is the problem\nMissed the shift by merging\nThey're radical politics\nThe electorate religious affiliation\nWhat you're doing it smearing the religion itself and making that the larger population\nCome to believe that all Jews are radical leftists which is where the problem begins that I Want to go into that\nBecause as I was reading about the Nazi who did this this cowardly not speak\nTo the French bull develop and ... developmentally disabled brothers\nOr this or their seventies and eighties some Ninety\nThis was a cowardly act\nThere was no heroism here\nI was thinking about this how did he know\nThat of all places\nHow did he shows this\nReformed temple in Pittsburgh\nHe said they had something to do with\nEncouraging the flood of immigrants coming into this country\nIf you were to analyze what triggered this guy\nYou know you can say I was just crazy it's crazy he's also a cowardly the killer\nBut there's always a reason inside a crazy person's head I don't know if you understand that\nIf you study FBI profiling they will always show you that even a crazy person in their own mind has a reason for what they do I don't know if you understand that\nYou have to uh that maybe you've seen enough movies\nThat fundamental thought that even a mad person\nWhen they committed an act of violence senseless violence\nIn their own mind\nThat they have a justification\nSo this lunatics that I'm going in after we saw the hordes coming in on the southern border now you say what's the connection if you can't see the connection\nIf you want to sit here skating around the truth is\nThat I've been trying to warn you about I Can't help you\nThere's only one solution to this\nProtect yourself at all times\nBecause no one else will be that protects you\nAt the end of this terrible tragedy\nWhere this this a Nazi psychotic\nKilled unarmed defense was Jews who I've known to defend themselves\nIt was the the police they were the ones who tracked into a little room where he was hiding today with the ones who got this cowardly psychotic to throw as weapons down in wasn't a bunch of liberals going in waving a Mr Roger's neighborhood in book form and asking him to please join them for a a a a a snack\nThey were ready to shoot and they got shot some of them guns can save lives\nAnd in New York by the way or the NYPD was sent to protect mosques [noise]\nThis terrible tragedy\nWhere this this ah Nazis psychotic\nKilled unarmed defense was Jews what nobody to defend themselves\nIt was that the police they were the ones who tracked him to a little room where he was hiding they were the ones who got this cowardly psychotic to throw as weapons though it wasn't a bunch of liberals going in waving a Mr Roger's neighborhood in book form and asking him to please join them for a a a a a snack\nThey were ready to shoot and they got shot some of them guns can save lives\nAnd in New York by the way or the NYPD was sent to protect mosques [noise]\nChurch members shot as they took part\nMainly older black people nice people\nSlaughtered by this maniac Dylann Roof\nWent in there and kill them shot them the same way these Jewish people were shot\nSo what is it in the minds of these cowardly psychotic ... that they pick on the softest weakest targets\nTo make their at the rain statements\nThat are going after armed people on the other side are they\nKnow they're always picking weeds defenseless people to attack\nSame way the Islamabad murderers target defenseless people on a Sunday afternoon\nOr the weather is on a bike path in New York or a nightclub\nPeople having a good time\nAlways defenseless people to the logical conclusion is\nIf the people on on themselves then okay most people are afraid of guns\nBy and large most people fear guns I've seen this my whole life\nI've heard people say I don't want a gun in my house and the answer is why well they're afraid they'll use it on themselves\nOr they'll use it against the spouse in a moment of rage\nAnd then there are those of us who understand the difference between fear in reality\nAnd we understand that we have to protect ourselves in a society where you can't have a policeman in in every home\nAnd so we come back to the questions of the day which is should armed guards be placed in houses of worship absolutely no question about it just as we came to that conclusion with the school shootings or common sense would dictate that of course most schools have\nArmed guards around them but not to the progress of\nThe regrets it behind is so blind\nThat no matter what the question is they always come up with the wrong answer\nWe're talking about the fact that hatred is in the air spreading like a virus\nWe're talking about the fact that the media\nIs the host\nOrganism that is spreading the virus\nAnd then there are those of us who understand the difference between fear and reality\nAnd we understand that we have to protect ourselves in a society where you can't have a policeman\nIn uh in every home\nAnd so we come back to the questions of the day which is should armed guards be placed in houses of worship absolutely no question about it just as we came to that conclusion with the school shootings or common sense dictates that of course most schools have\nArmed guards around them but not to the progressive\nThe regrets his mind is so blind\nThat no matter what the question as they always come up with the wrong answer\nWe're talking about the fact that hatred is in the air spreading like a virus\nWe're talking about the fact that the media\nIs the host\nOrganism that is spreading the virus\nWe're talking about the fact\nThat without hatred\nThese entities wouldn't survive a week\nThey wouldn't survive a week if they were told that they had to stop it\nIt really took Jeff Zucker in a room\nAnd you said you stop your Mary and that's on CNN from spreading this hatred against white people against white nationalist because you're just starting them up\nI'll tell you right now Jeb circa wouldn't change one word coming out of a Andy bloopers mouth or any of the other characters that worked for him in the chorus line\nThere's no common sense left there's no decency left in the media\nSo today I told you are I'm not going to write the whole ship of state\nBut I Am talking about\nWhy it happened in the minds of the Mad Men without\nJustifying explaining to different things\nGroup of regrets ... in Pittsburgh have the nerve\nTo say the Trump don't come to Pittsburgh you're not wanted here\nSixteen thousand communists\nIn a group called bend the are Jewish Action\nFunded by Alexander Soros\nTens of thousands of quote regressive Jews\nAnd now they're rising up and solidarity against Donald Trump\nAnd the board of directors goes along with this the or any idea what kind of anti Semitism stirs up in the country when the average person out there and they had to land says oh it's those Jews in Pittsburgh or don't want Trump there do you have any idea what damage progressive are doing to this nation\nThey should know that after the killing to stop it but they can't stop it\nBecause of liberalism is a serious mental disorder\nThe rabbi wants Trump there\nThe rabbi wants Trump they make no mistake about it it's this group of mental event individuals funded by Soros his son\nIn this group bend the ... which is quite ironic bend the arc you hear bend the arc\nI Wonder how long it's been since any of them actually walk with an ark\nWith a toe or from the arc and felt the power of those letters\nAnd the power of the books are Moses in those letters\nThere's a magic in it by the way a power that you can imagine unless you actually have done it\nWhen you're standing in front of those Hebrew letters even if you don't read them\nAnd you stare at them and you realize that for thousands of years these words of a God\nHave instructed mankind\nYou feel something that you can explain in other words there's no way to to explain that you see\nWell again I don't think we should lose the focus of today's program on the Savage Nation it began with and your ... many of your calling in this hour missed the opening to our number one which is a shame\nBut I understand most people listen for seven minutes or so to any talk radio show\nWith a holy cow dish the prayer for the dead\nAnd I was trying to set the tone\nNot only of civility but\nThe books are Moses in those letters\nThere's a magic and by the way a power that you can imagine unless you actually have done it\nWhen you're standing in front of those Hebrew letters even if

the tone\nNot only of civility but sanctity it was in the memory of those slaughtered in the\nSynagogue and Pittsburgh\nInstead I get callers who are so regressive\nThat they bring up George Soros like he has nothing to do with the hatred right now\nThat he's innocent lamb and he's been funding these radical leftist groups who are in fact are terrifying disease nationalist by the way of getting their backs up so if you want me to make the connections\nBetween the bogeyman of America today the one that you're allowed to voice contempt for the white nationalist I Will do so I'll be glad to do it for you\nThe biggest there have always been white nationalist in this country\nMany of them died in World War two\nOh yes I mean a lot of white nationalist in America look at some of the revolutionary war cemeteries\nOh yes there've been a lot of white nationalist in the ... in America\nLook at all of the um military cemeteries around America will see an awful lot of white nationalist who went to ... fight and die for their country\nBut all of a sudden the word and white in national spin linked together by the radical left\nInto one phrase that signifies something other than being Caucasian\nHula ... a Caucasian loves his nation suddenly it means something akin to Nazi as him\nOf the radical left in America they've tripped many people who don't even know what they're talking about the things that if you are of a Caucasian background and you're a nationalist you're a Nazi\nIn a necessarily sell so therefore we have to look into the mind of the white nationalist\nEspecially the one who did this horrible thing this killing on Saturday\nAnd I haven't gotten to it yet\nI tried to take you as a profile or into the mind\nOf that psychopath\nBut I'm not getting their yet\nWhat would make a man do a thing like this\nWhat would take a psychopath and triggered him like this\nAnd are we close to Germany in the Nineteen thirties\nJoy the Savage Nation coal no the five four

think the country's been responding correct the statements are coming in calls are coming in and I'm getting calls of the entire Jewish community or whoever is Jewish received some type of color a

like moving the U.S embassy to Jerusalem and you would think\nThat a reasonable press corps might say the ... you know the president has a Jewish daughter and son in law and the Jewish grandchildren how does this hit him instead they they seem anxious to to an end with other presidents if there was a connection of some kind you know to something\nOr in the in the world where they had a very personal connection that they wanted to know so how is this affecting the president was you know was he thinking instead\nA they're only aimed seems to be say let's let's see how we can lay the blame on him for things that he said or done\nFrom the media wants him to fail and more so they want you to be demonizing just saying that he never has any of public on or even once she does leave the presidency but they wanted to save them because the media is as you know\nNot due to most of the media what about Ninety to Ninety four percent of them are donate to to the Democratic causes they do their liberal ... some of them are big time left us and they're no longer honest brokers they're not journalists it's they're not acting as if\nThey were journalists who were supposed to sit back and be objective they've become a propaganda and then Dr nation are I mean there are a novel liberalism in on the Democratic party and there's it's it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing here because\nWithout a affair press the American people are getting outside the ability to make proper decisions\nI'm Talking to rabbis from who's the author most recently of pushback are claiming are American Judeo Christian even as\nThe other thing that came up and and I think they miss characterized the president's comments because he was asked by a reporter you know what what might have made a difference in in the reporter asked specifically about armed guards and the president said yes it it would have made some difference if if there had been somebody there with a with a firearm to respond to this attack\nThat took so many lives and they immediately cast that is Donald Trump blames the victim for being attacked but I Do wonder rabbi what do you think\nThere are congregations aren't there that that actually do a note that they need to to defend themselves is that something you think more synagogues will start doing in response to a a threat like this\nI Hope so because one of the obligations that we have is people who are community to our family is self defense we have to defend and protect people who are an Irish\nCame up and and I think they miss characterized the president's comments because he was asked by a reporter you know what what might have made a difference and and the reporter asked specifically about armed guards and the president said yes it it would have made some different if if there had been somebody there with a with a firearm to respond to this attack\nThat took so many lives and they immediately cast that is Donald Trump blamed the victim for being attacked but I Do wonder Rob by what do you think there are congregations aren't there that that actually\nDo a note that they need to to defend themselves is not something you think more synagogues will start doing in response to a a threat like this\nI Hope so because one of the obligations that we have is people who are community to our family is self defense we have to defend\nAnd protect people who are\nIn our responsibility and um\nI think it's a good thing if they would have a couple of people in the synagogue beyond whatever type of professional security they have at the anti says but it will be good in churches and synagogues\nOr a couple of people in conspicuous that no one knows they have some type of concealed weapon people that are trained to this they have a license to joke carry that this isn't the times that we live in\nAnd thank God we have a Second Amendment the founders believed in this or that purpose of having guns was not just necessarily go hunting for Turkish and dear buddy was to protect\nIn a situation like this for example eleven people were killed in some more were wounded if there had been someone there was a\nA a concealed weapon as soon as this started maybe two or three people would have been killed but that person could have just not\nThe assailant the murderer the slaughter right there and saved so many lives but the left doesn't want to hear this because they want the solution to be that nobody should have an eight guns\nWhile the criminals are always going to have done so there shouldn't be people I Know some guys to have a men in this and that guy that they have concealed weapons they've got permission from local police department if the train it's very important to self defense but can be more important than self defense\nNo kidding and he'd been had the lessons of the Warsaw Ghetto been forgotten already by the community\nBy the Jewish community yes well this isn't our our our difficulty is that we\nWe have a very liberal Jewish community I Would say about Seventy percent of the Jewish community as liberal and they're no longer learning the lessons of history they are a mash from from from head to toe and all this utopian liberalism a\nHocus pocus as they say patch the messiah that they think that's the lesson of history how quickly forget right\nIf people but remember the lessons of history will be left safer but that's a difficulty this and I think he's a some of the liberal churches would have this it made a a\nThis gun control issue it made a got out of it and uh so foolish it's we're so lucky in this country that we have the right to defend ourselves this police come they do a good job but they take some Fifteen twenty minutes in the meantime a lot of people can be killed in that amount of time to many though it's good to have some type of a\nDark shooter there who knows what to do\nThat there's nothing more important in the Bible and so that's\nBecause that that's what it means to be a responsible individual personal responsibility is to the center of the people that do have some really chosen to be responsible for their wife or children your family your church and the guys are community that's a that's noble estimate drastic adjusted well\nYou know right by I had the questions so many times over the years I've actually sat down and researched it years ago and and wrote a whole piece of Jesus Christ himself believed in the right of self defense and encouraged his disciples to do that or to say you have to have the ability to defend yourself and then he didn't just\nThis is the police come they do a good job but they taste of Fifteen twenty minutes in the meantime a lot of people killed in that amount of time to many though it's good to have some type of the\nShooter there who knows what to do\nThat there's nothing more important in the Bible and so that\nBecause that that's what it means to be a responsible individual personal responsibility is to just out of the people that you really chosen to be responsible for your wife your children your family your church synagogue your community that's the that's noble estimate justice but justice will\nWell you know right by I had the question so many times over the years I've actually sat down to research to years ago and and wrote a whole piece of Jesus Christ himself believed in the right of self defense and encouraged his disciples to do that or to say you have to have the ability to defend yourself and he didn't just mean metaphorically\nThe way I read history and I think that a modern American should think the same way as you say\nWith all due respect to the police and I love the cops when seconds count the police are only minutes away and I'm\nI I don't like it either when he does things like that but on the other hand if we called every politician every time they've said this is the biggest or the best of the first or the last or whatever uh we'd be calling politicians all day long on on those kinds of things\nI mean and I get Lars Larson on the line 'cause Lars Larson added a man who lives lost and going up on Iraq Obama after your like your doctor you can remember that large ... oh my God Lars Larson went ballistic went nuts\nI went nuts\nYou know you can then that kind of what you said was Fawcett and I said you know what I understand that he made a mistake but you're right Lars ... if that's not true it's not true okay well I did it why would you have a different standard for this president and the last president when this president does it all the time\nYou know one I have lots of friends who told me that their business is the biggest or the best of the longest time I think well if I really want to debate with you I could probably be chew on the fact but I also understand that some of that is just talk about what he's actually getting done for the country\nDo you think the mainstream press which I think you like a whole lot more than I Do like the ... and the New York times and and uh ... the chicken noodle news network and and MSNBC they won't give the guy credit for anything he got done will there\nAnything I boy I don't know I think what we have reports I mean obviously there's been some turbulence in the financial markets up late but there are people who are quick to give him credit and uh you know here at Fox News I think\nThis president then the last president when this president does it all the time\nYou know won I have lots of friends who tell me that their business is the biggest or the best of the longest time I think well if I really want to debate with you I could probably be chew on the fact but I also understand that some of that is just talk about what he's actually getting done for the country\nDo you think the mainstream press which I think you like a whole lot more than I Do like the ... and the New York times and and uh ... the chicken noodle news network and and MSNBC they won't give the guy credit for anything he got done will do\nAnything I boy I don't know I think what we have reports I mean obviously there's been some turbulence\nIn the uh financial markets up late but are there are people who are quick to give him credit and uh\nYou know here at Fox News I think we look for opportunities to properly deservedly give him credit when credit is due and of course Fox is the biggest cable channel and I think the wall Street Journal the biggest newspaper give credit where credit's due\nYou notice how the papers that actually tilt to the right to do a whole lot better than the ones that go to the left does that tell you about the audience\nI don't know I mean I think the wall Street Journal it's been pretty successful for a little bit of time\nHere is what I mean but but yeah I mean Fox has been very successful in the Trump era or and you would think if if we're told that people hate Donald Trump with a passion that Americans didn't want him that they reject him and that's what we're told at all the whole country hates the guy and and then the minute his approval ratings get\nActually better than Obama's words the same point in his presidency they stop reporting on the approval ratings and say oh we\nDon't know ... you know you're speeding agreements that fact is that when you look at Republican support for Donald Trump it's still in the eighties that's unbelievable it has ... Ramos universal\nHave you looked at black support since you are black black support for President Trump eight percent of the vote in twenty sixteen twenty three percent support by the middle of last year thirty six percent as we stand here today\nBy the time we get to twenty twenty Trump on this on that on that trajectory from may get to the point where he is half of of black Americans supporting him now what they had a friend who's a\nBoat those are such a weak pose with small sample size they say it's ridiculous but go right ahead so\nYou haven't heard about the blacks it\nOh yeah that sort of Kanye West and others fraud but it's\nNot just Kanye West because if cognac Kanye West can say anything he wants to but of black Americans weren't embracing at the numbers wouldn't be changing in that direction or would they\nKnow I think I think black Americans not embracing something let me just tell you but I think that anybody who's the income veteran who has the pope it it's going to have some impact but you're talking about starting at a point so low\nThat increases are going to especially when you have a small sample size than a poll is going to jump up and down but boy I wouldn't bet on that one and in fact going into this mid term elections the big issue is not minority groups it's\nWhite women Lars especially educated white suburban women and are given Trump's history Stormy Daniels and things like the health care problems that we haven't solved and immigration issues we haven't solved they're the ones\nThat reacts so strongly to the bombings the shooting over the weekend there still are you just decided that went on writing or are you going to say\nThe bombing is Trump's folders well\nNo I didn't say it was his he's not directly responsible he didn't told a trigger he didn't tell like either do go do it but I think the rancor the kind of you know one of the joys of our time together on the radio is I feel like we're having an honest discussion we are or who have different points of view and\nPoll is going to jump up and down but boy I wouldn't bet on that one and in fact going into this mid term election the big issue is not minority groups it's\nWhite woman

any political opponent as not patriotic a bad person a criminal I I just don't understand why you ...\nYou mean rancor like saying you won't get civility back till you put our party back in power that's\nNot what she said she said you can't be civil with people who are uncivil is just like hold are saying you know when they go low we shouldn't go I Wish you kick back\nYou know he said we

Donald Trump at this point is showing approval ratings that are in the forties where it was Ronald Reagan at about why\nThey roughly the exact same class Lawrence yeah his approval ratings um towards the end of a second term or high thirties low forties\nBut gradually economy approved and the third or fourth year of his presidency is approval ratings locked it up or to propel ... eighty four but at the first two years in his presidency his approval ratings are roughly right with Donald Trump's are\nBecause you point out in your writing that when Reagan left office in Nineteen eighty nine there were still people in his own party who didn't like him there were lots of Democrats who didn't like him I Know that there are lots\nYou know the the first elections but as you also know Reagan was able to recover it and he was able to land a massive reelection they hit us twenty six house seats as his first term elections\nBy the way ... Donald Trump at this point is showing approval ratings that are in the forties where it was Ronald Reagan at about\n... roughly the exact same place Lawrence yeah his approval ratings um cause I have a second term or high thirties low forties\nBut gradually American economy approved and the third or fourth year of his presidency his approval ratings locked it up for it to propel us and relate to a massive relaxed and maybe for the first two years in his presidency his approval ratings are roughly right we're dollar pumps are\nYeah because you point out in your writing that when Reagan left office in Nineteen eighty nine there were still people in his own party who didn't like him there were lots of Democrats who didn't like him I Know that there are lots of Democrats today\nWho weren't even alive when Ronald Reagan was president who don't like Ronald Reagan a lot of that it's based on mythology\nBut people have to remember that if anyone thinks you're going to have a president with approval ratings in the sixties or seventies\nIs not likely to happen Reagan had an average of ... approval rating as you point out that went all the way up to fifty two point eight just barely above the middle and so you have Donald Trump gets into the forties now and the economy continues to do well he might hit twenty twenty\nWith some very nice approval ratings from Americans about how well he's doing the job\nI think that's definitely true especially if the American economy is based on you know we have although unemployment rate and it's actually also are today that was that any time during the Reagan Era I like I said I'm climate stuff ... today um is\nProbably not so much for those five during the Reagan Era so yeah I think is the economy continues to grow and expand and as long as unemployment stays though I think Trump or probably maybe beginning towards the end of his third year maybe even the middle of next year\nHe will begin to see his approval ratings rise too much like Reagan's\nDead so even with the crunch down by the fed\nWhich has raised rates now three times a it looks like we could actually finished child the fourth quarter of this year or getting close to four percent GDP now I think I think the Trump\nWould be doing a lot better if he got the kind of favorable coverage that uh uh Brock Obama God for producing a lackluster economy the media seemed to be in a slobbering love affair with Obama\nAnd they seem to hate Trump with a passion if they were to to do stories that pointed out how much things have changed and how good things are right now economically speaking for Americans from might have an even higher approval rating the fact that he has\nA an approval rating in the forties when the media keeps telling Americans no matter what's going on around you the guy's a terrible guy\nRight now I I agree lawyers and you know one of the things I discuss with a bottle of vacant and intellectual biography does that compare the GDP Growth with Reagan Obama for Reagan and GDP Growth that don't it eight years of president average about four percent\nWhich is very strong so it was nearly ... percent I'm for Trump's right now it's it's been about three percent and the second year but yeah you know I I think your life that meat is certainly obviously there's no one would disagree\nWith with a point that that the media is much harsher on Trump than it has been Obama which you know and they completely stay are considering a duty people have to certainly been stronger under Trump than Obama but of course if it has it been yet is styles that was under Reagan I Know that they're all like and it was four percent\nNo it has an and and I guess some of this is about times do change and I know that when when Reagan was showing these great growth numbers for the economy\nI didn't hear I hadn't heard any economist saying it'll be impossible for us to reach this and the other piece that I think is not being mentioned in you tell me what you make of it he was that if reporters were honest and said heading up to the twenty\nThere are so it was nearly ... percent uh for Trump's right now it's it's been about three percent and the second year but yeah you know I I think your life that lead it and certainly obvious and no one will disagree\nWith with the plight that that that made it much harsher on Trump than it has been Obama which you know and they completely stay are considering a GDP Growth has certainly been stronger under Trump than Obama but of course if it has it been yet as strong as it was under Reagan I Know that they're all like and it was four percent\nNo it has an and and I guess some of this is about times do change and I know that when when Reagan was showing these great growth numbers for the economy\nI didn't hear I hadn't heard any economists saying it'll be impossible for us to reach this and the other piece that I think is not being mentioned and you tell me what you make of it\nHe was that if reporters were honest and said heading up to the twenty sixteen the lecture when Donald Trump was saying we can grow at three or four\nEven five percent and all of them said no no no no the smartest people in economic say America has a new normal that's different than the Nineteen eighties and then we can never get really much more than a tenth or a two tenths of a point about two percent and Trump is already producing that number\nIf that contrast was being drawn by reporters and believe me doctor I say this because as a reporter myself for Twenty years we always I mean that was a big part of the job of being reporter is you didn't just say well the number is to this today\nA ... because people would routinely want to know well what does that number means you say well it was half of that a year ago and it might be twice that a year from now then that gave them some contacts for understanding what a particular number means whether you're talking about unemployment rates are average household income or any number if you said gee\nWe got a lot of rain this year well how much do we get well we've got twenty percent more than last year a ... then that gives people a contact surrender saying oh we did get a lot twenty percent more than last year\nBut I have yet to see a single mainstream reporter maybe I've missed it\nBut I read a lot of different news sources from both the left in the right I've yet to see anybody in the mainstream say all the smartest economists said that economic performance above about two percent was simply impossible including the likes of Paul Krugman and Donald Trump is already clips that number handling\nHere exactly right large you know the same thing happened in the late seventies early eighties quite before in the early years of Reagan's by a safe you know the economists are saying\nWell you know several eight percent unemployment at ... percent GDP Growth that's just the new normal\nBut Reagan was inherently optimistic and in this little that amounted to do better than that and you know like you said it it just because the price of the economists say well you know that the GDP Growth is going to continue to be cheaper than a dozen it has to be that way or make them as often as\nHe knew that America to to do better than that and I think you're right and ready immediate choose to be a little more optimistic and do a little better job of selling how you know the American economy has done better and can you continue to do better\nDoctor burn is the author most recently of Ronald Reagan an intellectual biography be foreign wrap up tonight with you I Want to know I Know that this makes it certainly makes a left cringe when I say those but it also makes even some of my conservative friends cringe when I say\nAre their favorable comparisons to be made between Ronald ... president Ronald Reagan and president Donald Trump [noise]\nSure there are favorable comparison is a for example both raking in South believing heaviest that defense spending most of them believe that that you know a strong America's better America\nA Reagan of course the whole time you know the ever lower taxes both for for all classes really Reagan of course cut taxes or every class so basically the same failed so they're definitely a little science comparisons similarities\nAnd let's go and do a little better job of selling how you know the American economy has done better and and he will continue to do better\nDoctor burn is the author most recently of Ronald Reagan intellectual biography be foreign wrap up tonight with you I Want to know I Know that this makes it certainly makes a left cringe when I say those but it also makes even some of my conservative friends cringe when I say\nAre their favorable comparisons to be made between Ronald Reagan president Ronald Reagan and president Donald Trump\nSugar favorable comparisons of for example both raking in South believing heaviest that defense spending most of them believe that\n... that you know a strong America's better America\nA lake and of course the whole time you know the ever lower taxes both for for all classes really Reagan of course cut taxes or every class so basically the same thing so they're definitely you know little science comparisons similarities between ... and the differences too but yeah there are similarities they certainly are opposite\nKnown in fact I've I've seen that as well and while obviously does the communication style of the two men is very different they both are very good communicators\nOh absolutely they both are that it contained a message on my ... message was always a little more optimistic and Trump is a little more gloomy and pessimistic but despite that I agree that there that's greater can convey a message that I was just the content that what they convey as a little different I really hope in his last year\nOr at least in the next two years as President Trump becomes a little optimistic and publish the Reagan lenient and ... you know the classic argument that Reagan made with it It's MORNING in America and that our best days are before us and I hope that tries to at least because the end like Reagan a little bit more and and as often as I\nTo newer stuff here\nBecause it's developed here but the reason is develop tears you can pay\nOr you can charge the price is necessary to recoup the development costs which I understand now on the average pharmaceutical to get it all the way from white lab coats you know doing experiments with bickers all the way to appeal you can get from your pharmacy and take is about two billion dollars if you can't get that two billion back\nVery few people I think are going to be willing to say well let's throw a lot of money into that\nWill come up with a wonder drug and then everybody will insist on getting it for fifty cents a bill that that doesn't work nobody wants to do that and nobody will do that so when we stopped doing it who's going to develop the new drugs to treat\nAilments you know that that aren't treatable right now\nNo one yeah absolutely nobody will and and that it's a big part of the problem with it there's all sorts of ways to address to the price controls overseas in terms of intellectual property right or\nYou know in ... with the countries and that's something that because we know we should be pursuing to to make sure the country's respect our intellectual property rights and that's a I think a smart way to proceed but you know price controls is going to do exactly what you said we've had some great uh innovations\nVery few people I think are going to be willing to say well let's throw a lot of money into that will come up with a wonder drug and then everybody will insist on getting it for fifty cents a bill that that doesn't work nobody wants to do that and nobody will do that so when we stopped doing it who's going to develop the new drugs to treat\nAilments you know that that aren't treatable right now\nNo one yeah absolutely nobody will and and that it's a big\nPart of the problem with it there's all sorts of ways to address to the price controls overseas in terms of intellectual property right or\nYou know in ... with the countries and that's something that because we know we should be pursuing to to make sure the country's respect our intellectual property rights and that's it I think a smart way to proceed but price controls is going to do exactly what you said we've had some great uh\nInnovations in terms of cancer in terms of hepatitis C cures to diseases that didn't exist before and we did a lot more to do and if we if we stop on price controls we're not going to get there\nWell and see that's the concern I've got a dog because I'm I'm pushing sixty at this point I have to take a couple of medicines but I think they've been out of copyright or pat and for a long long time so they're dirt cheap even have if you have to pay for him out of your own pocket but I worry that we're we're going to have all these companies say I'm not going to go out and spend a lot of money\nTo come up with a new drug if I can get the money\nIt seems like the uh get the money back for what the cost of developing was and making it profitable and frankly for all the people curse the form of companies I don't ...\nThey want a Fifteen Percent return is a high risk activity if they took the same money and put plywood it into a restaurant they get eight percent return and other investments they get other returns but you want a slightly higher return because you're doing a more risky activity that brings lawsuits and\nYou know terrible stories in the news you make a bad drug and you don't know it's bad to lose out and you know a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand people a ... there are all kinds of risks for risk there ought to be reward so\nIs it I'm I'm just wondering why when the president's focus so much on trade and intellectual property up till now why he doesn't say we're not going to put price controls on we're just going to Canada in China and Russia and Western Europe you got to pay\nSomething closer to the real costs to these drugs and if you rip us off we have ways to punish you through lack of access to American markets wouldn't something like that also have the ... in other words if the pill really takes twelve bucks a pill\nTo recoup the cost and Americans are now paying fourteen dollars a pill and Europeans are paying four dollars a pill or because because they're ripping or candidates for being four dollars a pill\nWhy do we tell Canada they gotta pay the same price we do and Europe has the pay the same price but the overall prices will drop from fourteen down to nine Europe will pay more will pay a little less the drug gets paid for does not seem like a more sensible way to go at it\n... the few restrictions we have anything to better off kind of globally things would be so\nThese are always complicated they don't always work out you know ... we would like it or as you were describing but I I I think the sentiment is spied on in terms of it when we're having trade and ... and we we all we need our intellectual property rights are respected and that's something\nThat you know if it's important to achieve in pharmaceuticals it\nIs important in many other kind of interesting as well and that's something that shows that we we want to engage more with the world\nAnd then do it until we and to make sure they do all the intellectual property rights are respected you know the the other point that you made which is also really important to emphasize is [noise] it it mentioned you're investing your money for your retirement or your kid's college or whatever you're saving for vacation new boat\nWell certainly there are fewer restrictions we have the better off kind of globally things would be so I\nThink there are always complicated so they don't always work out you know ... we would like it or as you were describing but yeah I I I think the sentiment is spied on in terms of it when we're having trade negotiations and we we all we need our intellectual property rights are respected and that's something\nThat you know if it's important to achieve a pharmaceutical as it\nIs important in many other kind of industry as well and that's something that ... we want to engage more with the world\nAnd do it until we and to make sure they do all the intellectual property rights are are respected it you know the the other point that you made which is also really important to emphasize is ... imagine you're investing your money for your retirement or your kid's college whatever you're saving for vacation new boat\nYou you're not going to put that in a company that's going to lose money nope it put it in a company we can't get that risk reward tradeoff ... if you think about it is your own investment where are you going to put the money and if somebody said hey look we're going to slap on price controls on some of the most innovative drugs and you can't recoup costs\nWere you invest in that company I think most people would say no and I think that almost humanizes exactly what they're kind of capital market process that's occurring why would you invest in a company that can't get to that kind of competitive with\nYou I can meet your own personal financial goals\nAnd Dr the only thing I Wish I Wish the former companies were out there more instead of talking to Congress talking to the American public because almost every other industry that faces these kinds of problems with governments and marketed comes out and makes its case to the American public and I think the former\nIndustries for some strange reason as being very very quiet about all this and that makes me wonder why aren't you making the case we need\nThe money and if we have to get it from you will get it from you and if we can get it from you then you

biometric in order to get on the Internet this is for these people are going\nTo the tea Alex is that we can try to fight them and there's there's plenty that has already been done to fight this we've already had a Supreme Court decision going back to Nineteen forty six of people wanted to pay any attention to it\nIt's a a a situation where the Supreme Court said you cannot even if you own the the public square this privately owned it was a a town that was owned by one corporation and they had a lady who wanted to pass out some Jehovah's Witness literature\nShe bought 'em all the way the

thirty some odd years this person has been putting his money in the hands of a broker\nThat is giving him almost ... you should go to jail for the returns that this person has given them seriously\nThey're making thousands of ... percent on you know what they do they call up all the money together that works I'm going to do it in layman terms let's say a thousand if you give Seventy five out give it to the money goes to a broker they take all the money put it in one poll\nAnd then they bad against what you do that's what the institutional buyers and stuff they bet against you which means they're hedging whatever they put you in the other side that what you do isn't going to work\nSo when it when it doesn't work they make millions and billions of dollars\nFor thirty some odd years this person has been putting his money in the hands of a broker\nThat is giving him almost ...\nYou should go to jail for the returns that this person has given them\nSeriously they're making thousands of ... percent on you what they do they clump all the money together that works I'm going to do it in layman terms let's say a thousand if you give Seventy five out give it to the money game to a broker they take all the money put it in one poll\nAnd then they bad against what you do that's what the institutional buyers and stuff they bet against you which means they're hedging whatever they put you in the other side that what you do isn't going to work so when it when it doesn't work\nThey make billions and billions of dollars and that's the way it works is it fair game that's the way it works you can't be mad at him that's the way it works OK Now let's get that straight you can't be mad at the few for working the system that the system that we have\nBut in return we get what dust you make what one to four percent maybe now I'm not an advisor over that I'm just telling you from my own experience what happens\nSo of course you're afraid if the professionals can't make you wealthy then how can you who it's not a professional last because you've been told for decades that you're not smart enough you're not educated enough\nThat you don't have a license who are you to make money out of yours the money you put away who are you to make yourself a millionaire you can't do it what are you stupid you got to leave it to the professionals to do what [laughter]\nI'm

square foot pain that you did this two big\nCan't we get something smaller something that I can manage you know we have some babies let them play in the yard and the grass and that's what I Need something smaller so I went and got a smaller house we did keep penthouse though for five years [laughter]\nAnyway have smaller house and then she says to me now I Need to know what you have I said that's fair enough was and we sit down I didn't argue whether I said let's sit down after she told me let's sit down we sat down and I ... light it out what we have as it is what a guy\nAnd then we started making a plan will first thing we did we used we set some goals you guys out there you got to set some goals talking to this couple yesterday said some goals so am I always had some golf this what we want to look to achieve\nYou're going to dream dream big\nWhy not the American dream this is America your dream dream big so we set some goes down and then we wrote a little plan to get there but I showed all my finances is what I Am as well [laughter] that's when she told me we had too much when they start giving some white\nOr give more away than what I was given anyway\nBut I showed her what we had and that was a conversation and then I had to let her speak into my finances because we were walking together so if you have someone you're walking together with you got to sit down and have these conversations\nAnd I was talking to one of my new guys that are hired I said listen or you follow my game plan but here's how you do time management you spend Fifteen minutes a day\nOn one let's say you're gonna spend Fifteen minutes here you're never spend thirty minutes on another project maybe an hour here and then you compartmentalize\nSo we set some goes down and then we wrote a little plan to get there but I showed all my finances is what I Am as well [laughter] that's when she told me we had too much when they started giving some white or give more away than what I was given anyway\nBut I showed her what we had and that was a conversation and then I had to let her speak into my finances because we were walking together so if you have someone you're walking together with you got to sit down and have these conversations and I was talking to one of my new guys that are hired\nI said listen or\nYou follow my game plan but here's how you do time management you spend Fifteen minutes a day on one let's say you're gonna spend Fifteen minutes here you're never spent thirty minutes on another project maybe an hour here and then you compartmentalize your time and if you do that every day it's not overwhelming\nYeah not overwhelming and we spend an hour a day\nOn your personal wealth and people are afraid to look at it they get these credit cards and somebody gives you a credit card for five grand they say you start making your payments you're spending the money to raise it before you know what you got thirty forty fifty thousand dollars worth of debt that you're paying on now you're in bondage\nAnd you never talk about it seriously if you if you really love that person that you're with your walking with or if you love yourself let's say you're a single then you're going to want to pay attention to your personal wealth\nAnd we spend an hour a day just it just an hour\nYou got twenty four hours in the day they gave her time here's I Do my day you get up to my personal development takes a couple of hours to do what I'm going to do six I Am I'm writing I'm working on\nMy spiritual time mix Saturday got his time what am I going to do that surely I could spend an hour a day on my personal wealth\nNow in the beginning it can be overwhelming I tell you it's going to make you want to take a nap you're going to oh boy or do I have to do this or you know what you're passing out and that it will do that to you it can be stressful it can be overwhelming it's enough to make you get into arguments\nHere's the thing though if you're walking together with somebody and you want the best for them you want the best for you then you'll do it\nAn hour a day yes what at the end of the year that's three hundred and sixty five hours\nThat you put in your personal wealth just doing an hour a day\nLooking at swatch yes three hundred sixty five divided by twenty four that means you spent Fifteen full day of the year Fifteen days a year paying attention to your personal well\nLet me tell you something if you spent Fifteen days a year one hour a day seven hours a week that's not very much to ask out of a person out of yourself\nYou are going to get wealthy you'll see what you need what you don't need you set your budget\nMhm\nIt's crazy and we ... we do all kinds of things but we never pay attention to our well\nOr a day seven hours a week

dollars a month they kept putting it in there and they turned it into what was it\nForty eight thousand dollar or something like that at that point they were nervous they go oh boy you got it [laughter] you got to help me now I said All right I'll help you\nI have a question for you know because you've been trying to get me hooked on this for some time and I've been thinking about it if I were to recruit some wealth and just say two hundred dollars a month and because that's about the lines I was thinking it would it be better for me to give you twenty four hundred dollars now or just give you two hundred dollars each month\nYeah it'd be better to do twenty four hundred now but we ... we don't really do things that small anymore right because we weren't buys that are larger and denominator yeah fifty thousand is basically what okay now I Will do the smaller was by the way it won't last\nTime list there's what is something that would be acceptable for you beneficial to you and the person that's a given their\nWell it will do the two hundred dollars for you if you're going to continue to put that in\nNow do you have to John ... actually have to do that too because you'd be two hundred well er I mean how does that work\nWell they we we have some paperwork to do sign yeah okay we do have some ... most people don't want any paper work it out because they don't want anybody tracking them\nAnd right now by the way that that that that really transitions us into a good story okay let me get to that real quick I Want to go back to that because of Ron Paul was talking this morning let me get to that right here by and get to that subject here\nUm that Steve while as well as in the act let me get back to that worry is that so Ron Paul you everybody knows Ron Paul

protests just shows you that I got the money right All right and um that that protects the person but the um the you have to\nIf you're going to I'm mainly taxing the people that are doing it on their own you got to pay attention to what you're doing but if you buy with me we don't do the small I'm not going to do the the small amount we we used to do that but we we're past that now\nYou only get I get Seventy calls a day where people go I've got fifty thousand a hundred two hundred thousand can we do this yeah we'll give me some paperwork and then every couple of months we let you look and see what the uh see what we're doing with it OK in ... that was a good question thank you Ron Paul\nWho served in the uh as a U.S representative\nSo Ron Paul you everybody knows Ron Paul right\nRon Paul

let's\nWe're talking with Veronica since early from grass medical marijuana delivery service\nRocket before the break we were just starting to talk about what phenomenal results looked like something

sometimes goes away completely but a lot of people you know extremely diminished pain I'm and inflammation being able to actually sleep throughout the night and not wake up from pain\nTo address was information as well as the ... that's always the key thing ... what about the information's anniversary thanks very excellent well I'm ... let's talk about the liver service um you if you talked about what you are how you how does this work and how is different than the others that may be out there are other than the little the boy delivering very\nSure yeah so um our service ah we ... full service so if a person needs to be connected to a doctor to get certified we have a network with doctors that we work with that will do certification we have mobile doctors that will make a home visit to certify for legal access to Canada\nAnd then we help them if they need help but they're not technologically savvy because we do have an application that makes it really easy to order from a phone but if they're not tech savvy if they don't know how to use technology we will create their account for them and help them order I mean we really hold the hand of our patient through the entire process\nOr we provide that counseling so we help that walk them through the menu and talk to them about the products and what\nMy helicopters before they get there so you you could ever mentioned as I think I'm the go there's got to be with the legal aspects to that you mentioned Dr and there's also marijuana card they have to have yeah so you go through all that stuff was the first time patient correct ... so how tough as to what what are the qualifying for conditions to legally get married or a\n... a marijuana card\nYeah so you have to have a a qualifying condition about probably eighty five percent of the conditions come from a chronic pain diagnosis because so many elements fall under that migraine type ... so many\nUm write us\nAnd then ah their cancer there's peach yet the there's Parkinson's disease muscle spasms and that a a less prone to be you know agitation from ... disease we work with the dimension of unity quite a bit rain so those are probably the top ones that we work with there's a few others\nUm but you know chronic pain cancer those are those are really big ones many Alzheimer's big ones\nI can you know I guess I can see this for pain piece okay but you mentioned some of the I just thought I knew for oh there maybe ... to show to do them but how would an old timers for what is your show and you know yeah I we hold it up you know back to the old timers patients how old are you know that itself is because most of the time they can't articulate writer\nIn reality sure it's it it might just say I'm just going to add real quick is it mostly just to calm down at dementia resident that would have outbursts of agitation that's\nA big part of it yet agile he gave him all damaged in ... downing the live people get very aggressive with caregivers of outburst um they won't allow them to be showered or change and they're fighting their caregivers horrible for the patient the family member right and the caregiver\nAnd so with candidates at just calms down makes them more compliant and and happy you know a lot of them suffer from depression and anxiety sleeping disorders and a lot of disruption in in reading disorders which adds to the agitation\nA lot of those is extra observational type information that you're getting from the interested parties with their family or the caregivers et cetera what behaviors ours was your\nIn reality sure it's it might just say I'm just going to add real quick is it mostly just to calm down a dementia resident that would have outbursts of education that's a big part of it yet address from all damaged in ... slips on downing\nSo a lot of people get very aggressive with caregiver of outburst um they won't allow them so that he showered or change and they're fighting their caregivers ... horrible for the patient the family member right and the caregiver\nAnd so with candidates at just calms down makes them more compliant and happy you know a lot of them suffer from depression and anxiety sleeping disorders and a lot of disruption in in leaving disorders which adds to the agitation\nIt's a lot of those is extra observational type information that you're getting from the interested parties with their family or the caregivers et cetera what behaviors ours was your reaction where the behaviors of guessing ... and there's something else like pain\nAnd some of these pharmaceuticals sometimes they exacerbate their behaviors so you know there's people that\nRespond horribly to opioids are Dakota added in and out of an anti psychotic I mean they just create zombies out of these poor people and their family members that you know they go when they visit them and they're either knocked out and ... or\nYou know agitated and aggressive anti springs back some of that cognitive function some of their social behaviors even verbal acuity come back ... with an Avon only therapeutic\nI got to ask this question only because you talked about the legalization your ... your medical marijuana Kurt how old are you think our neighbors to North we talked about this before the show we'll countries is legalized you know marijuana okay you I mean two weeks ago yeah how will that\nThe fact that you know where you at them that's legal you see that impacting like ... like um individuals get them regular for pharmaceuticals from Canada you see that kind of thing coming in and how would that impact us down here but not quite legal you know you know\nYou're right yeah I mean I think the recreational topic a distracts from the medical aspect to it though and we want to be taken seriously for medical right and we've heard that from others as well so yeah I I completely agree that said if ... is legal and [laughter]\nOther things are legal cigarettes are legal you know candidate should be legal it's a lot safer than alcohol it's better for you\nUm you're calmer so again I I I Do believe that it should be allowed recreationally but I I Want to focus on the medal medicinal after them now I Will say that we've been working with dementia community here a lot in in Arizona and some of the organizations that were working with have locations in Nevada and California and the recreational state\nWell sometimes it makes it easier for them to any family member can just walk in and buy the Mediterranean and and bring it back and not worry about getting pulled over and not having a hundred dollar caregiver card and so\nThere's benefits and there's drawbacks to it but I'm at the end of the day the industry is moving forward and\nThat brings me to another question here is that you want to be taken seriously in the conversation I think those were going to start um so how do you go boat changing the conversation to be taken seriously and everything is happening in our world where everybody looks for the negative side or whatever it is you're doing right\nYeah I think it comes down to education I Know you I started um an education group called candid with community talked with a local natural path doctor\nAnd we teach science based education so we're just we're out there you know talking to anybody like opportunities like this are wonderful things to talk about science behind down to any any opportunity we get to educate we take it\nWould we would we some of the highlights of them some of your educational things that you present owning the sense that it sounds like everything is happening up to this point\nForward and that brings me to another question here is that you want to be taken seriously in the conversation I think those were going to start um so how do you go boat\nChanging the conversation to be taken seriously and everything is happening in our world where everybody looks for the negative side or whatever it is you're doing right\nYeah I think it comes down to education I Know two I've started um an education group called candidates community talked with a local natural path doctor\nAnd we teach science based education so we're just we're out there you know talking to anybody like opportunities like this are wonderful because we talk about a tire behind down so any any opportunity we get to educate we take it\nShorter boy would we would we some of the highlights of them some of your educational things that you present only in the sense that\nSounds like everything is happening up to this point I'm hearing Italy's\nWho's with the medical marijuana in the medical cannabis the conversation is comes from individual success stories but you know that's that stretches of the conversation over a longer period of time right and so\nHow ... what kind of things are you talking about education that will maybe richer further group to make short circuit some of this link females\nYeah well the exciting thing is that the ... rescheduled CBD and um there was just a drug um that was passed by the SPA pass through clinical trial called EPA dialects which is they so it forced the da to re classifying reschedule CBD to schedule five so the fact that\nA plant based pharmaceutical just got passed and is for seizure disorders and we've we have the ethic of the\nYou know people are there's there's there's increased awareness mhm uh THC is going to be right behind it the pharmaceutical company that created the drug also has in their pipeline THC product mhm\nThat will become legal in the u._s. um so when the d._a. rescheduled THC to schedule one and they have to admit that there are medicinal benefits to it that that's happening on a national scale\n'em and you know hopefully the case study that we published with banner ... um there's another doctor that I'm working with that on another memory care community that we might do some case studies with and we're just gonna keep publishing this information and there's a lot of groups that are that are doing this so\nWhy does candidates works so for so many health conditions\nYeah there's there's a a long drawn out science explanation but the very simplistic way can explain it it's our ... system in the series of cell receptors throughout our body and when the chemical compounds in the plant\nBind to those receptors mhm they acted neurotransmitters so they communicate to our body what we need for balance ... and um you know they have a very um strong therapeutic benefit these receptors or in our brain down our spinal cord energy I tracked um on our white blood cells throat sore throat or immune system so\nYou know they affect a lot of different um parts of our body and\nA lot of different systems\nYeah no no we're getting back on your short on time here so let's put something in like a commercial for just a second before we get from sure hook or listen to your hold of you have any

Ninety three going a Ninety four or just the over the weekend and my son ... from the airport says hey daddy said you didn't get something that you can put in the system that you can\nBoth to prove that Internet of things which are are you a short handed I O T I O T devices can add value that they can save money they can improve our lives by automating\nBeing the eyes and ears that maybe we don't necessarily have because we're out and about maybe we went to the store and we forgot to take our ... well actually is really kind of nice to have a machine to call you and say hey you know what John\nAnd you take your medicine it's a you know nine o'clock you're supposed to take your eight o'clock meds that's kind of a buddy system especially if we maybe in some cases we live alone and we don't have that system\nWell I'm Glad you brought that up because I think that you know you're onto something there is an organization that I have a Ninety ... Ninety three going a Ninety four or just the over the weekend\nAnd my son ... from the airport says hey daddy said you get something that you can put in the system that you can be notified so that if mom is walking around the house there's some there's a sensor that says if you see if you see movement is some guy so that you know that she got up in the morning ... he's walking up the stairs or

I Want to ask you this or that that he has a a financial accounted I guess you are I don't know proceed beyond the ... and Greg or as a business owner can you imagine\nSomeone to come up USA Gregor like thinking about becoming a you know that can you show me how to run one of these things and then you can you show me your financial statements let me look them she or payroll and your expenses and your insurance could you give me all that inside reformation or\nYou know very similar to to best and I and I'm you know where\nYou lied to help you know all those lifestyles members it that we can\nAs members from looking inside out and remembering back when you were looking outside in what do you think creates the abundance mentality that the members of lifestyles has that there's enough for all of us where do you think that come from\n\nBible part of life and I ... I mean there are always deals going on there I always African you eat half\nBaked goods will hear lifestyle call so there's no need for me to map how are you from ... hit man but how can you get right or\nNot you\nSo much to talk now machines is topic oh go ahead Greg good morning yeah go ahead\nWell I think it it goes along well with the case studies you know you're not a member you come in and you see these families up talking numbers in and you know spelling their guts they're they're doing it just you know because they're grateful that they were able to make this money on this deal\nUm and I think it's just it sets the tone I'm\nA you know that sort of what we do here in a you know and what's expected and\nAh I just I just you know that\nI don't know how you say it you know I guess that's what I expected as a little harsh but uh it's just a friendly caring type atmosphere\nLet's go down a different route now and let's talk about you brought it up earlier Gregory Gregory um that about networking\nMassive massive massive opportunities that network both on the road trips case studies the advance the expo everywhere and that led to you\nInvesting with thirty three different lead investors\nIt's just it sets the tone um you know that's sort of what we do here in a you know and what's expected and\nUh I I just I just you know that\nI don't know how you say it you know I guess that's what I expected as a little harsh but uh it's just a friendly caring type atmosphere\nWhich go down a different route now and let's talk about you brought it up earlier Gregory Gregory um that about networking\nMassive massive massive opportunity to network both on the road trips case studies the advance the expo everywhere and that led to you\nInvesting with thirty three different lead investors can you sort of parse it out for us how did you get thirty three different people\n\nUm and they'll be being an aggy or that sort of sticks out a bay their love you I hate you\nBut ah you know\nLike you know meeting people and you know they're all all open and uh I don't know but then he helped me out here how did we mean thirty three just being active\nWell I mean ... well being active is absolutely wrong I think you know it\nGoes back to I in a way almost treat this like a part time job I heard it I Will now if they get to meet people\nAnd that's one of the things that you do to try and decide if you want and that's like ... you know how much do you like how much do you like what they're saying are they educated like you are\nAnd what is it that you need to do you know Gregory went to San Antonio I'm an ... that cart and we emailed them we ask questions than um we got their resumes you know the whole time or kind of lets them to see\nWho do we like who has the deal that would be like that and what we're looking for but\nStill at the news when our time job is also centered around food and\nAn entertainment so it's not a do it when I Want to do it so to speak NATO [laughter] ever even an eight to twelve\nGood even in the line [laughter] so you guys have a I think you guys about probably answered my question all the way I've been answered for the audience I always ask people do you believe more in the horse or do you believe more in the jockey meaning you worry more about the deal do worry more about the person leading the DEA which one do you guys believe in most\nWhat what do you what is more important to you the horse's jockey\nWhere it's worst wet Gregor I think is more about the horse or the Jackie and you know the lead and I'm more than a

A. changes or anything we keep up to date\nAnd also you do much more than that I mean you also even have a medical resources for them as well so let's talk about that too so one of the other things that we provide some medical supplies and the reason why is because we've had so many people complain about how expensive they are\nSo not only do we provide medical supplies we provide free quotes so if you find something you know that's expensive you can call us and we'll look everywhere and if we find it somewhere that it's cheaper than we can provide then will recommend that other provider\nNow you're a free service to people yes correct and uh this is what you your valley wide\nYou're rated with the better Business Bureau ah they're on Facebook Instagram linked in and YouTube so you can see them all there but more than anything this is all about getting place are there are people that are obviously listening here that might even be living with someone where they're just thinking\nYou know what I'm not sure I can do this anymore right there are people that are listening that are baby boomers\nThat are have parents that they don't not sure what they're going to do because\nYou know maybe they're not even able to do it so you they would call you they would talk to you and then you would do what you're doing for everybody is in home assessment and you're going to offer that for everybody to call in and get\nWhich they'll come to you you go to them you go get in their home so we do it a free in home assessment and many many medical providers in the valley do do that and I'm One of the main goals that we're all trying to reach\nYou're valley wide you're rated with the better Business Bureau or they're on Facebook Instagram linked in and YouTube so you can see them all there but more than anything this is all about getting placed a there are people that are obviously\nListening here that might even be living with someone where they're just thinking\nYou know what I'm not sure I can do this anymore right there\nAre people that are listening that are baby boomers\nThat are have parents that they don't not sure what they're going to do because\nYou know maybe they're not even able to do it so you they would call you they would talk to you and then you would do what you're doing for everybody is in home assessment and you're going to offer that for everybody to call in and get\nWhich they'll come to you you go to them you go get in their home so we do it a free and home assessment and many many medical providers in the valley do do that and I'm One of the main goals that we're all trying to reach us to see if we can age in place\nYou know kind of be safer to live at home um and so we you know we evaluate the fall risks can they stay at home with some home modifications or it was an extra assistance and then of course\nIs recommended then we can we can tour other options right now we're going to open\nUp the lines here she's going to be offering for everyone to get a case of gloves\nI mean this is a ... different but there's a lot of people out there that are living with ... that somebody that they got to where the gloves right and so it's a vinyl or nitrogen did I say that right\nAnd this is a forty to sixty of dollar value free to you or anyone that you know our number here were to leave these lines open for everyone to call him throughout the rest of the show us our number here is six so to to seven seven five three six nine\nToll free it's one eight six six five three six eleven hundred it's a case of gloves and let me tell you something those gloves get expensive\nAnd you got to use them all the time because you use them once you've got throw it out right I mean it's hard to keep 'em on all day long they're there for a reason now you you can check them out on their website which is in touch senior services dot com\nYou can call them this is the free service to you the number is six to three to zero one eight five for five okay so also we want to make sure that you understand that it's also about\nA medical services as well if you need for instance in things like ah I guess I'm ... I'm it as you say oxygen or things like that what are the different things\nYes so we can recommend a mobile Dr hospitals home health\nPalliative care what the difference is um a temporary caregiver a rehab center what we do right now is we're working with um rehab centers in hospices we'd do industry report on a medical facilities and location in Arizona valley wide\nAnd we'll go and do an industry report and then post the difference between the facilities\nUm and the difference between hospices or how to choose a facility or a hospice and those are the two we're doing right now and then very moving on to other services like\nI'm home health or um medical companies like medical supplies um and then another program we have implemented upgrade Glendale and we're working with every single assisted living home in Glendale\nAnd we're helping implement their policies therefore we have a website with a password on it changes every month and any care homeowner can log in and download all the resources they can possibly find\nAnd forms to help keep their standards well hearing from you is that you're all about educating ... but on both sides it sounds like\nThat's really awesome leaving that so basically what makes you different is what so one of the things that makes us different there are some agencies on that charge for state which is all tax for placement um for the facility that's always usually free to the families but we don't not even for the facilities\nOr um medical companies like medical supplies um and then another program we have implemented upgrade Glendale and we're working with every single assisted living home in Glendale and we're helping implement their policies their forms we have a website with a password\nOn it changes every month and any care homeowner can log in and download all the resources they could possibly find\nAnd forms to help keep their standards well hearing from you is that you're all about educating crap but on both sides it sounds like\nThat's really awesome they're leaving that so basically what makes you different is what\nSo one of the things that makes us different there are some agencies on that charge for state which is all tax for placement um for the facility that's always usually free to the families but we don't not even for the facilities so when it comes down to all tax reduced replacement for the facilities and the families\nAnd another thing that keeps us there are many great agencies here in the valley\nUm maybe a hundred referrals specialists\nAt least um were regulated there were a member of passers it's um the professional association obscene referral specialist and\nThey get regulated you know so we don't step out of blindly follow the guidelines we follow 'em disclosures that have now been implemented and another thing that we do differently if we actually created a group for all the referral specialists in the valley so we can communicate because we believe that together is better\nAbsolutely and what I also hear too from you is that you're there are people that want to stay home as long as they can\nSo you offered the medical side of it that the um uh not only the the um [noise] resource resources but also if you go in the house and you see that there's you know this person needs maybe this that or the other thing\nYou can offer that to them at a special price because you said that you look for the best prices also\nThat may even just keep them there for a little bit longer so you won't know until you actually have that in home assessment with you and some of the items are free because a lot of Oregon ... organizations are donating items to us so we can provide than to the homes\nOr an older adult in their home on other things that we are pushing for ... for a member of ... it's the Arizona assisted living home association\nAnd we continue to get educated through them they're always providing educational classes in the valley open to the public so because we're board member we get to learn a lot more about aging than we would just by researching Internet\nUm we go to ... courses about behavioral a lot of times a lot of our placement um they'll get put in the home by a a family member or friend or you know not a referral specialists and they're not place correctly and we're\nAlways putting out fires were taking someone that has a little bit of behavioral can be monitored and putting them in a home where they should have been in the first place and sometimes some of these older adults they've been relocated six times in three months\nAnd then just keep being kicked out because they're beyond their level of care well I Know\nNow while you're so busy I can hear it because you actually do a lot more than I've heard anybody ever talk about that is awesome and they're here if you're a senior advocate but you're also you called it what was aging spent aging specialist but you said that they're older adults we don't call them seniors as much anymore and we were calling him\nA aging adults what'd you layer adults older adults older adults such me well because many of the older adults that we encounter they don't want to be called the senior\nThey still want to excited because that little discount but anyway go ahead\nAnd one of the other things do you do have a Medicare person coming up um but we're very excited about some of the new Medicare changes that are becoming for older adults they're going to be helping them age better in their homes they are going to be providing um some of the transport\nA medical transport and some other supplies and resources to live in their home well we've got our lines open here\nWell I Know now while you're so busy I can hear it because you actually do a lot more than I've heard anybody ever talk about that is awesome and they're here if you're a senior advocate but you're also you called it what was aging by aging specialist but you said that they're older adults we don't call them seniors as much anymore and we were calling him\nA aging adults what'd you layer adult older adults older adults that's me well because many of the older adults that we encountered they don't want to be called the senior they still want to I was excited about that little discount but anyway\nGo ahead and one of the other things do you do have a Medicare person\nComing up um but we're very excited about some of the new Medicare changes that are becoming for older adults they're going to be helping them age better in their homes they are going to be providing um some of the transport a medical transport and some other supplies and resources to live in their home\nWell we've got our lines open here and I know it sounds kind of crazy but if you need to go out to you know ... while you're working to make sure every year or sterile\nBut that is correct I mean uh each carrier has their respective plans and and and those plans are ... they're all a tailored to be really good plans but the the thing that happens is that\nMaybe the plan for that particular care is not the one for you maybe the prescription drug plan doesn't work maybe they have just one doctor in in network when you have three or four doctors are seen\nAnd so because they represent a majority of the plans\nUm I look at all the details I I Would learn when I Do reviewing reviewing to see which plans carrier doctors I review each plant to see how your your prescription drugs land inside of the costume system would cheer level it's in um if it's gonna be forty five dollars or forty seven hours for two or three when someone else how's it for for Fifteen and a tear to\n'em so it just it just depends on on each thanks so what what I offer is a is a blanket in terms of what is available in your service area literally from all the carriers and there's no extra charge me doing it for you if you go\nTo a directly to a carrier they can only sell you their plan and uh obviously when when someone's pitching that they're they're gonna tell you how great their plan isn't it is really a good plan but it might be not that may not be the one for you\nWell there's no service says safety is because it's a it's a priest charge right now there's no the whatsoever\nSo given the call let me give out its number six to\nSeven seven zero nine zero six to ... a B C D Medicare dot com a plus

I basically most of my family is I can cut their power costs in half\nSo that's a lot of that over the next twenty twenty some years cutting their costs\nReally do feel I Am making a difference in people's lives because when we look at it our power is our second highest expense that will help in a lifetime second to our houses\nAnd we just think that we just have to keep on paying or figure out ways to um live more energy efficient we've just about done everything energy efficient this year that we can do um in our building still gone up and I really really take a lot of um pride in\nHelping my family and realize that they do have another way to go produce from power on your own roof lock in your own rates put more of your hard earned money back and your family's pocket on ...

Seventy five to eighty percent off of their power cough or pee locking in their rates and they're looking more comfortable and more affordably in their homes\nSo it's all about educating and informing my family is you have an option\nRather than renting your power it's why you bought a house in ... that you're living in you worked hard to buy your home for your family to live comfortably in your home um is why you buy your car car you know that you're going to use it you know what you ... what are you want what are you going forward thing with your home [noise]\nWell it's the same thing with our ... our power is an absolutely essential to living in her home we're going to use it every day we might not even use our car every day we might stay home for the weekend or whatever not drive a car but we still pay our monthly payment for a car but we know what it is and we know when it's paid off we still have our car\nWell with power from the power company we're continually pain to them and there's no end to it and it continues to go up whereas when you're producing your own power you're now you're on for a plan on your own home where you park your car and you're paying less for it\nAnd you know what you're paying for the next twenty twenty or Thirty years okay and let's talk a little bit of first of all these still go out to everybody valley everywhere valley white\nS.
