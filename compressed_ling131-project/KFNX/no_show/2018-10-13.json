we're in power again and we take the power away from them so it's not coming out of a vacuum it's coming from the top down\nAnd I think someone needs to say to them cool it because you know what I Know one mass hysteria gets out of control it doesn't limited self to one side of the aisle\nWell and and I do worry and I hope that the people on the conservative side will maintain a sense of decorum we can be passionate we can be a very strong spoken\nBut we should never take A People's freedom and liberty from them and that's what you do when you go to a place where they're having a restaurant meal when they're at their homes\nOr when they're trying to enjoy a movie and and when you take their liberty from them that's not America Michael that's not what we're about we're about district green but disagreeing and the right way and the right place at the right time\nUs but we don't go and hound people try to get them out of business and that's what these loans are doing\nWell okay so the question becomes\nHow do we stop it I I spent a half from show yesterday Governor Huckabee speaking to attorneys who are actually representing people who've defended themselves in restaurants against these left wing mobbed it's not an easy question\nBecause there are limits to what you can do to defend yourself but on the other hand we can't run away just because they want us to run away\nAnd that's the topic for another day we're talking about this issue but for a few seconds talk about the mid term elections I personally believe Governor Huckabee that the violence of the quote new Democratic Party as Eric Holder calls them things actually saying this is the new Democratic Party we kick them when they're down\nBut I actually think that this is going to alienate the vast middle ground who are going to move over to the Republican side and it's going to have the the help to respect that the radicals wanted to have that even Hillary Clinton thinks it's going to have what do you think\nI totally agree because there are a lot of people who are Democrats are people who think left of center or who are unabashed liberal decent human beings and they're not hateful people and they're they're not looney tunes are they do have some sense of a personal responsibility and they don't want to see people get hurt and injured\nAnd there's a whole move on to walk away movement interestingly it was started by young then I had on my show I'm Brandon struck out who it is interesting a New York ah activists\nOr he's he's gay it probably is the last person lot of people think would be on my show we hit it off great we had a terrific can counter\nOn that he has been a long term Democrat and he's sick of this stuff and he was leading a movement called walk away and people can go to the Facebook page and stay in their houses are people who are\nAre truly you know liberal but they're no longer going to support the Democratic party because they feel like it's gone off the deep end and then\nAnd they're not hateful people and they're they're not looney tunes are they do have some sense of a personal responsibility and they don't wanna see people get hurt and injured\nAnd there's a whole ... on the walk away movement interestingly it was started by young and I had on my show I'm Brandon struck out who it is interestingly a New York ah activists\nOr he's he's gay he probably is the last person lot of people think would be on my show we hit it off right we had a terrific can counter\nOn that he has been a long term Democrat and he's sick of this stuff and is leading a movement called walk away and people can go to the Facebook page and stay in their house and the people who are\nAre truly you know liberal but they're no longer going to support the Democratic party because they feel like it's gone off the deep end and they no longer can associate themselves with something that is why to them and that his or encourage people to the violence\nAnd uh and and to destroy people's personal liberty but\nGovernor governor can be you are a media star you're also a musician you're also a devout Christian and the Christian teaching said that you should turn the other cheek but that doesn't mean turn the other cheek forever does it\nWell turn the other cheek does not mean that you're a a tip squeak I I think people's you know say bless it doesn't make me does not mean week the\nWording comes from a word and it means strength brought under subjects and it's the same work that would be used to speak up domesticating a horse\nWhich doesn't mean you make the horse leak it means you channel his strengthen his energy and Jesus said blessing to the mic what he's saying is blessed are those who keep their strength to have power but who channel it in a way that it's constructed\nSo this idea that Christians are just push rovers and we sit back and take it into Chen\nOr you know that's not true we're going to stand up for justice for what's right\nI think it's more of an appropriate for people who are believers not to be angry and not to try to seek revenge but to try to seek justice and justice is not being served when people lied about when they're accused falsely through things that are incredibly horrible things that happened that human beings\nAnd it is the\nAbsolute imperative for true people of faith the fight against those injustices\nSo anybody who thinks that that even calico world is going to sit back and just\nAct like it's okay to the Savage rabbits and destroy boy are they ever long\nWell the next step is going to be what happened in the in the old days in other words if we don't stop these left wing moms\nThey will go into churches and upset sermons and knocked over alters we can't permit this\nAnd I think that we we people of belief we people of traditional values have to understand that self defense is the only kind of defense there is at the end of the day but I don't want to get into that right now I Want to stick to the positive and\nWe'll go back again to the politics of the day the country moving so far away even from the Democratic party moving into the street violence of the communist movements I Believe politically is going to have a uh uh the opposite effect in the midterms I think you just agreed with me correct\nAbsolutely I Do feel that there's a blue wave ah is is maybe grossly over estimated I think we're going to see a huge turnout from Republicans and conservatives who are beginning to wake up\nThat this is no time to sleep that after we saw what happened to

F. and acts and today's topic is as always pain management without the use of medications and a lot of that stuff that doesn't work for you and we also have a special guest on the show today we're going to be hearing more from her later on in the show\nI have Victoria who also a ... she is an acupuncture certified acupuncture is and ...\nShe calls have you found out it snoring life solutions\nIn Peoria and right where I have my office and in fact and\nAs always we uh what we're talking about is\nA pain management alternatives to going to the doctor and taking pills and ah which pills don't do any pain pills do so much more harm than good ... you know not only are they the addictive properties people get dependent on them\nI'm pain pills you know they stop your body from warning you that you're hurting yourself worse you know pain is there for a reason\nIt's your body saying hey this hurts don't move it that way or else you're going to hurt at worst that's why it hurts you start go up and down pain pills you're not going to be able to feel that you're\nInjuring that origin ... already injured area of your body even worse by over using it I see that all the time it's a real real problem in this country they did put the restriction on the opioids are leading in pain killers in the world\nAnd uh I like I mentioned on almost every show is eighty percent of all the opioids manufactured in the world are eaten by Americans\nAmerica only makes up five percent of the world's population and we are gobbling up eighty percent of the world's supply of this powerful painkiller\nA government has put restrictions are only allowed to give five day prescriptions to people now when they go to the doctor without you know they can't refill it till they come back to the doctor\nBut I'm sure it's they're gay keep refill on them for you when you want 'em but they also are required now by law to refer people out to people like myself to do therapeutic massages and people like Victoria who do does acupuncture and a reiki\nAnd uh it's really\nMy ... my big purpose with this show is to get people to be aware that therapeutic massages medical massage is much different than what people think of when they think of getting a massage\nHas massage has the stigma of a flower behind the year hot stones aroma therapy soft music and it's just relaxation of luxury for the rich type of thing but it's so much more so much more I've developed a technique of neuro muscular trigger point therapy\nThat I can get rid of most pains that people get I you know\nPeople like myself to do therapeutic massages where people like Victoria who do does acupuncture and a reiki and uh it's really my ... my big purpose with this show\nIs to get people to be aware that therapeutic massages medical massage is much different than what people think of when they think of getting a massage has massage has the stigma\nOf the flower behind the year hot stones aroma therapy soft music\nAnd it's just relaxation of luxury for the rich type of thing but it's so much more so much more I've developed a technique of neuro muscular trigger point therapy\nThat I can get rid of most pains that people will get\nI've you know wouldn't have believed it myself if somebody told me this back before I went into school or even while I was in school but\nMost people that go into those places to get a massage you know the fast food of massage places of all those chains that are all over the place I started out working in those places and I found\nAll sorts of great people there and it's a nonprofit organization as well it really good people and I can book appointments there my regular rate is only fifty dollars per hour regular rate ah which is like half the price of what a those other big chains are charging\nYou know after your first visit they heard like Ninety nine dollars per visit unless you give them a credit card that they can keep the number and keep charging every month\nBut my mind is just fifty bucks every uh every time\nAnd like I said a lot of these issues that people have\nCan be corrected in one visit you know a lotta times though it you know it did take you a lot of years to work up all these knots and your muscles that are causing the issues you have today so sometimes\nSometimes it takes a longer appointment or sometimes it takes a couple of appointments but everybody gets a lot of it feels a hundred times better after only one section it's just a ... really uh\nReally gratifying work I've worked in a lot of businesses a lot of retail a lot of a\nCustomer service all my life and I've been told by hundreds of thousands of people thank you\nBut it was always as a courtesy yeah thank you have a nice day\nAnd you come again you know what type of thing but since I've been doing what I'm doing I actually get heartfelt thank yous from people 'cause these people have suffered with headaches back pain hip pain psychotic pain shoulder pain all their life you know most of their life you know\nUm it's just a feels real good to help people out and you know that's why I'm I'm not in it to get rich you know and I got bills to pay like everybody else so I Can't do it for free I'll tell you if I Want\nIt feels a hundred times better after only one session it's just a ... really uh really gratifying work I've worked in a lot

know I got bills to pay like everybody else so I Can't do it for free I'll tell you if I Won the lottery I'd probably be still doing this for free [laughter]\nBut ah just because it's just you know I haven't found anybody else they can do it you know like I mentioned uh back when I was in ... school\nThey had the student clinics where people come in to get massages from people that are still learning what they're doing and I had a girl that was a concert cellist with an orchestra can constant repetitive our motion and she had a real severe pain in her shoulder joint she had already been to the doctor\nDr wanted to give her pills she said she couldn't take the pills he was allergic to them that doctors had gone put ice on it kicked her out of the office she came into the student clinic\nI worked on her a little bit and I found in her chest muscle or upper upper chest the ... major I found an ... muscle and as soon as I put a little bit of pressure on it she said she could feel that in her shoulder joint\nAnd I was I asked her is that right where it normally hurts and she said yeah and I said well let me hold onto it for a little bit here and make it release and see what happens and I held onto it for about Fifteen seconds then it release and all of a sudden she says the pain in my shoulders gone\nAnd she started she's laying on the table she starts moving her arm around and the pain was completely gone and that was really my life all over the head moment that I realized you know I must continue to study after I got to get out of school and learn everything I can about the neuro muscular system of the body how nerves and mussels interact with each other\nAnd everything about trigger points\nUm because like I said we all have nots and our muscles right now if you grab the side of your neck and feel up and down on those muscles on the side of your neck you're going to feel a little hard spots in those muscles\nThose are not send the muscles we all get them it's hard to avoid getting them but there are a lot of things you can do to avoid getting um like such as cell phones you know you don't\nI'm not saying stop using your cell phone just stopped looking down at your cell phone hold your cell phone up around shoulder level that way you can look down at it with your eyes and not with your neck\n'cause once you start looking down at a book that his cell phone at paperwork on a desk gravity grabbing onto your face and trying to pull your head down all the muscles around your neck and on your shoulders are flexing to prevent your head from just flop and forward\nSo if you're looking down at your phone you're reading and writing tax you're looking at Facebook you're like in stuff on Facebook you're checking your email you read in your email\nYou just spend a lot of time with your head and the downward position and that's all those muscles in the back of your neck of the sides of your neck and your shoulders are flexed holding your muscle in your head in position so it doesn't flop forward\nJust little things we do every day anything anytime you do something\nThat doesn't feel natural uncomfortable you know I mean just the smallest little twinge of up that kind of feel good backup don't do it that way readjust your body a couple of examples just to give you a mental visual is guilty\nTo your face in trying to pull your head down all the muscles around your neck and on your shoulders are flexing to prevent your head from just flop and forward so if you're looking down at your phone you're reading and writing tax you're looking at Facebook you're like and stuff on Facebook you're checking your email you read in your email\nYou just spend a lot of time with your head and the downward position and that's all those muscles in the back of your neck of the sides of your neck and your shoulders are flexed holding your muscle in your head in position so it doesn't flop forward\nJust little things we do every day anything anytime you do something that doesn't feel\nNatural uncomfortable you know he just the smallest little twinge of up that guy and feel good backup don't do it that way readjust your body a couple of examples just to give you a mental visual is\nYou know think about trying to get your keys out of your right pocket with your left hand\nOr try to reach something in the backseat of your car and it's on the seat right behind you 'cause then you're extending you're twisting and extending your body at the same time and that is really gonna tear up the muscles good\nUm but you know these are not Senate muscles really never go away on your own I've had people that have had the same notch the same condition for\nThirty and forty years uh I've mentioned the story about the guy that was ... said he was had low back pain since the time he was carrying a sack of grain down the stairs at the ... slid down the stairs on his back this had low back pain every sense he hasn't worked in the mail for forty years\nI got I'm On the table worked out I Know exactly where to look you know I Know I Know where the muscles are on your body I Know where the nerves are you in your body I when\nYou give me a complaint I don't go off of what a book tells me you give me a complaint I look at the I ... I\nUsed the X ray vision and my fingers and I looked at the muscles I looked at the nerves I feel around I Know where the nerves are going and release the knots that I find I don't just jam and the muscles it's really a great technique really exciting um and I've been helping a lot of people getting a lot of good response off the radio show here\nThat a lot of people have been coming out to the Peoria office and the Phoenix office and they're all incredibly happy they did\nAnd I'm happy they are too because I I just really get such a good feeling you know like my Fridays so y'all have massages book during the day my radio show at night I normally put in sixteen hours a day but I go home with a smile on my face I just feel good about what I've accomplished for the day just 'cause it's\nSo amazing you know uh you know fix them people up and I want to fix you up to 'cause I'm betting every person who's listening to this show right now\nEither has some kind of pain themself for headaches or knows somebody close to them that does I Can't I Can't believe anybody that that wouldn't I'm so\nI remember this information you can also go to my Web site at I'll fix you dot com I.

anybody\nSo when we started to eliminate negative thinking going over problems time and time again repetition were basically shutting ourselves down [noise]\n[noise] yeah that's that's actually a lot of the way I was raised from the time of which I was a child is my father understood that it's your state of mind your emotional state of mind directly affects your body and makes you more susceptible to getting ill I'm not feeling good mhm\nOh when I was a little kid I Would I Would tell my father I don't feel good and my father would ask me what's wrong he would say what's bothering you and being really adult lives in my little and significant life at the time you know what was bothering me\nWell that's very important because when you go as a label as I have arthritis when you begin to describe it it's hot or it's cold it becomes a live and when it becomes alive you have a chance to be able to fix it when you walk around with her label of arthritis or a pain in the neck\nYou know basically you're stopping the flow of energy or stopping the life force\nSo visualize yourself free a stress free of pain and free of emotional damage you know what people said to you how you react in your life it's all part of the same syndrome\nSo my job is to begin to get in there and move that energy move the blockages I was trained in China worked in the hospitals in Beijing\nSo I've spent time in England and I've been in practice for over Thirty years so I work with you and I began to give you tools that you can do for yourself and begin to change that negative thinking into a positive way of life\nA fantastic ... and er how how about the physical pain that people come come to you about you know the people company or with headaches and back\nTry to come with all kinds of conditions whether it's menstrual cramps whether it's\nA ... addict or whether it's neck problems digestive issues but when you go back to the emotions and you begin to start to heal that\nFor example each already in the stomach\nAnd the spleen has to do with worry and what women do best they were here and there are they over think and they're constantly\nIn there where they can't sleep at night they're feeling like their whole body shutdown so what I Do is I Begin to get in there and see I look at the pulses there's twelve pulses in Chinese medicine I look at the time 'cause all the organs on the town and\n... and uh how how long the physical pain that people come come to you about you know the people come to do with headaches and back\nAnd try to come with all kinds of conditions whether it's menstrual cramps whether it's\nA sigh addicts or whether it's neck problems digestive issues but when you go back to the emotions and you begin to start to heal that\nFor example each already in the stomach\nAnd the spleen has to do with worry and what women do best they worry yes and they are they over think and they're constantly\nIn there where they can't sleep at night they're feeling like their whole body a shutdown so what I Do is I began to get in there and see I look at the pulses there's twelve pulses in Chinese medicine I look at the time 'cause all the organs are on the town\nAnd I begin to see what's actually happening and they underneath and then I use the tuning forks which began to work on frequencies to shift the frequency and begin to allow that area described to clear I Do the shock the balancing play do a lot of different modalities and mix and match\nAnd if you think about an outfit you're constantly changing your outfit so why not change your disposition\nGray and and you do a lot of raking\nCorrect I Do ... and then I also teach it so I make basically awake you master and allow you to begin to take control of your life when you take control of your life your life started to work I look at whether you're emotionally depleted whether you're\nFinancially depleted um whether what's your negative thinking what you're talking and most people stay up at night they begin to talk and I suggest that you begin to journal\nWrite it down get it out of you who led to stay stocked most people go round and round in their heads is like a yoyo\nAnd his yo yo yo up you yoyo down and you basically start to kill yourself you know this is hopefully the beginning of the starting to work together because we make the team and we work together and to know and like solutions which is a therapy center so why not work with emotional pain physical pain and\nSpiritual pain and started to begin to look at your life where are you calling in the next ten years what do you want to bring in your life\nYeah that's great ah 'cause I I studied reiki before I got into massage school and the transfer of energy that\nUh is beneficial to you I I thought I was really fascinating because\nWhat is the first thing someone does when they bump their head they ... they place their hand on their head view Bangor D you place your hand on your knee is just an instinctual even children do it\nBecause it is a natural instinct to balance our own energies and when someone comes to see a ... such as yourself you definitely cannot suits and getting the energy balance of the shock roads [noise]\nYeah that's very very important and it's important that you take control of your life you know as you start to do that your life will begin to start\nTo work fantastic and like a

are great\nAnd having me on I've written political books and they've done very well in this book I Try to bridge politics with history\nAnd and I found out that a little history goes a long way such as saying that this bartender can you name one country on earth was not salad and blood and conquest and it's instantaneous the answer say no I really can't and enjoying that by learning a few things\nYou can probably turn arguments with rational people now that's a big copy a rational people write that\nDown and I think there are some people might want to ask me and so you engage with your

neighbors who might be ideologically opposed to them\n[laughter]\nYou can't see here's the problem I think the battle lines are drawn\nAs a I have said before and unfortunately I see happening ... years ago wrote a book or stop becoming civil war now there's a becoming sort of a common thing like having another civil war you know uh I think the battle lines are drawn the Mason Dixon Line is very clear people on both sides families are divided just like before the civil war\nAnd we'll we're waiting for a Fort Sumter and I think Dianne Feinstein was a living embodiment\nOf Fort Sumter with a lipstick I've never seen anything like a woman trying to set a nation on fire as what she did to this man\nIs so funny kind of paying like three of his head\nInto big it's a big problem the history has been walked into everything white as bad everything American as bad because of the radicals took over the educational system a long time ago Common Core is still in most of the school systems\nAre Trump was supposed to eliminate it on their education secretary divorced it's still there you know there's a lot of issues that we we can go into my point in writing\nUh I think the battle lines are drawn the Mason Dixon Line is very clear people on both sides families are divided just like before the civil war and we'll we're waiting for a Fort Sumter and I think Dianne Feinstein was a living embodiment\nI'm a Fort Sumter with a lipstick I've never seen anything like a woman trying to set a nation on fire as what she did to this man\nMy favorite show of force plane went down three\nI haven't had\nA big it's a big problem the history has been walked into everything white is bad everything American as bad because of the radicals took over the educational system a long time ago Common Core is still in most of the school systems\nAre Trump was supposed to eliminate it on their education secretary divorced it's still there you know there's a lot of issues that we we can go into my point in writing stop mass hysteria is to try to give people pieces of history that they can use as soundbites\nTo try to get a rational discussion going\nIn their own family and people who disagree with them that don't even know the history of the country yeah you know my show I mean you're asking a big question why do they think I don't know what the opposition thinks that America is the worst place on earth at any one white is an evil racist how did this ... how did this happen\nAnd has happened that would make the point that a person like a Palestinian terrorists Linda saucer or my opinion of Palestinian terrorists can lead a women's march and call a Susan Collins a white supremacist because of her vote however we reached this point that any one of them that low caliber would be taken seriously by the media\nYeah no it Michael it's a great point unless speaking of hysteria and it goes to the part of the title of your book about the ... let's talk about the current which on the Russia collusion probe\nIn quotes led by special counsel Robert Mueller notice it very chilling to me and the Gina as people who have worked on political campaigns engaged in campaign strategy so now Mueller's team Michael is reportedly investigating Republican researcher Peter Smith\nSmith raised about a hundred thousand dollars to find Hillary Clinton female the wall Street Journal is reporting that Mueller is interested in Smith because he told people\nThat he tried to recruit that he was connected to several Trump campaign officials including guys like Seattle Michael Flynn says Smith is a hundred thousand dollars from for investors on top of the fifty thousand dollars he himself put in to me and like all this chilling because this looks like motors attempt to criminalize\nStandard old campaign strategies but even worse first protected political donations and opposition research because the wrong guy won the election I mean it is not the definition of hysteria\nLook where Mueller when first started with the Russia collusion which fell apart and I'm so you arrested people who did commit crimes unrelated to Trump and now he's going after the campaign individuals for things they did that as you say are legal buddies dropped the Russia collusion investigation\nWhich led us not forget was his original mandate in other words there was a ball field with parameters on it\nAnd the perimeters war Russia collusion well now he's branched into anything he wants to condemning anyone he wants he is now a law unto themselves and I believe it's long overdue that Trump's fire Mueller frankly\nMueller has greatly exceeded the mandate\nThat he was given this is the kind of persecution that destroys the nation so to answer your question of course is violating the man's civil rights mhm now where wherever we stop it's like the guillotine who's next morning way will now arrest somebody on Fox News who had Donald Trump on his show too many times\nIs that the next thing say that's collusion between the media and Donald Trump is that in our crime on the on the Robert Mueller\nI've seen that way Michael\nAround they have like a second term anybody really\nLucian investigation\nWhich led us not forget was his original mandate in other words there was a ball field with parameters on it\nAnd the perimeters war Russia collusion well now he's branched into anything he wants to condemning anyone he wants he is now a law unto themselves and I believe it's long overdue that Trump fire Mueller frankly\nMueller has greatly exceeded the mandate\nThat he was given this is the kind of persecution that destroys the nation so to answer your question of course is violating the ban civil rights mhm oh where wherever they stop it's like the guillotine who's next morning wait well now arrest somebody on Fox News who had Donald Trump on his show too many times\nIs that the next thing say that's collusion between the media and Donald Trump is that in our crime on the on the Robert Mueller\nYeah I've seen that way Michael around they have like a second but I really want to get to that because I think that the character role I Will turn out envision today and how to branch\nOn Twitter and Facebook I have to watch my back every step of the way and I have to carefully Frank phrase when I phrased because they could take me down any minute long overdue we we have a Federal Communications commission that weight that supposedly overlooks TV radio stuff right FCC\nWhy don't we have the equivalent why don't we judge role in\nThe social media outlets into the FCC and make them answer to them there needs to be some constraints on them\nBecause they're too big to operate independent businesses they are and now a public utility\nAnd in the sense as a public utility they need to have some kind of controls on them so they can not an act of censorship that we're seeing for example by Jack Dorsey on Twitter takes anyone down he doesn't like it's time to roll Twitter and Facebook Google the others into the federal communication\nSystem FCC laws allow that's I think that's a good first step is very simple\nFree market her ten thousand Michael fat if I call waiting for like a ... I have a fact of life care buck stop mass hysteria mess it out of South Africa and I'm Glad you write about it 'cause I Know people don't care\nAnd they're like all out and buy a book and like they can take over what my book fair and half of it that talent and I\nHang in there because it will be back in a few minutes with more wit and wisdom of Michael Savage\nJoined those Savage Nation kono he'd five or four hundred Savage eight five or four hundred seven to eight to salvage\nThe Savage Nation is sponsored by Swiss America the only company I trust with my financial future coal eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or switched America dot com\nHey you know it's not smart job sites that overwhelmingly with tons of the wrong resumes but you know what is smart zip recruiter dot com slash Savage she unlike other job site zip recruited doesn't wait for candidates\nTo five years or recruiter finds them for you it has powerful matching technology which scans thousands of resumes identify people with the right skills education experience for your job and actively invites them to apply\nSo you get qualified candidates fast no more sorting through the wrong resumes ... waiting for the right candidate to apply it's no wonder that zip recruited as rated number one by employers in the U.S this rating comes from hiring sites on trust pilot with over one thousand reviews\nAnd listen right now is average listeners contrived zip recruited for free at this exclusive Web address zip recruiters dot com slash Savage that zip recruiter dot com slash Savage essay V.

Lars Larson show welcome back to\nThe program blind to get your phone calls and emails that eight six six eight large that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven as I said\nIt's been a very busy week including one of the biggest international stories has been a Washington Post journalist who went missing after entering a Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nAnd the problem is that we now believe that he's been killed and that the Saudis knew about it and not only knew about it but participated in it I've been ... by a writer sparrow to join the known worldwide as America's rabbi of Middle East observer and a political analyst rabbi welcome to the program and thanks for taking the time and I\nWill thank you it's good to be with your Lars\nWhat has happened to them all cause show ...\nWell I don't know any more than you know but he's not here that's for sure and uh how he was a done away with well nobody's exactly sure although there are there are some indications\nBut ah I don't think he's alive he's he's certainly not alive how he met his death that's that's a question and I'm but I'm sure that people like Mike bumped pay or John Bolton I'm Jared crushed our look at the bottom of all this\nTell me this you know we've at least heard suggestions that there's video and perhaps audiotape\nOr that indicates that he was actually murdered by the Saudis we don't know and I imagine you'll say we don't know for sure but do we have really good reason to suspect that the Saudis who are officially our allies may have murdered this journalist and if they have how what should America answer that with\nWhat they may have what we'll find out I'm not normally I'm not a great fan of turkey especially under aired again a year but will will eventually find out but I'm Glad you asked the other question because there are some people that are suggesting\nThat well if the Saudis did do this that we should have cancel all deals we have with selling them ammunition and planes and the equipment I I I wouldn't go that far I mean listen they're going to get them from the Chinese do get them from the Russians and I think we have to make a distinction between\nLet's say a regime that did kill a someone that they wanted to get rid of\nGood reason to suspect that the Saudis who are officially our allies may have murdered this journalist and if they have how what should America answer that with\nWhat they may have we'll we'll find out I'm not normally I'm not a great fan of turkey especially under aired again a year but will will eventually find out but I'm Glad you

planes and equipment and I I I wouldn't go that far I mean listen they're going to get him from the Chinese do get them from the Russians and I think we have to make a distinction between\nLet's say a regime that did killed or someone that they wanted to get rid of and this happens quite often that's really different than the regime that would be involved in the wholesale genocide\nFeeling of people wholesale oppression up because if we're going to set the standard so high that any nation that through a kills this particular spy or that particular prisoner they want this one knocked off which happens with many many nations\nWell the American people are going to suffer because then we'll have to we won't be able to sell people defense equipment or\nFarm equipment or cold but you know this is the Chinese do things to and yet we we sell them cold so it it's one thing if there is a government that's involved in the wholesale genocide well there's a certain moral principle there but um if they kill someone because they consider that person to spy yet we don't like\nBut they do that but we can't punish ourselves in tire industry is that I don't think that would be moral either why should a fellow who's ... and ... and\nIn western Pennsylvania and the cold business why should he now not have an income for his family because some internal Saudi thing or some internal Chinese thing why should he loses his job over there\nAnd rabbi might be a bit hypocritical don't you imagine that our government truth be told occasionally kills people are in various places for reasons that they may not be able to even tell the American public about\nYeah well I'm not going to admit to that [laughter] but but even the lead the best of countries\nAre sometimes um when it comes to certain individual people that they feel it may have been a spy or a mole or um or you know a lot of these things these deep deep CIA type of things that we have no way of knowing ever really um so\nWe know these things happen but like I said there's a big difference but before we punish entire\nIndustries which we always have to translate that into people there are people all throughout West Virginia and and southern\nPennsylvania northeast Pennsylvania that depend on a thriving coal business really depends on China or\nWhat are we going to do put everybody out of business and then everybody in the ... Boeing they can sell anything so what's that going to do to a parts of that they have employees in Seattle they have in Chicago that got down on the Carolinas the farmers are working with all the farmers in Iowa in Kansas\nSo I think that I was hoping you were going to ask that question because we've got to make a distinction between a country that's involved in the wholesale genocide versus all this stuff that has to do with spies and I'll tell you one more thing\nI Do feel this if this would not be a reporter and he happened to work for the Washington Post I don't know that there'd be such\nAn outcry all over the world about this in the western media it's one of their own as opposed to let's say some businessmen was knocked off for some reason that we'd hear about it but I don't think it would rise to this level this is this is a journalist\nEverybody out of business and then everybody in the Boeing they can sell anything so what's that going to do to a parts of the they have employees in Seattle they haven't Chicago they've got down in the Carolinas the farmers are working with all the farmers in Iowa in Kansas\nThough I I think that I was hoping you were going to ask that question 'cause we've got to make a distinction between a country that's involved in the wholesale genocide versus all this stuff that has to do with spies and I'll tell you one more thing\nI Do feel this if this would not be a reporter and he happened to work for the Washington Post I don't know that there'd be such\nAn outcry all over the world about this in the western media it's one of their own\nAs opposed to let's say some businessmen was knocked off for some reason that we'd hear about it but I don't think it would rise to this level this is this is a journalist so you expect the brush to make a a a very strong case at monumental cases if we're supposed to know several relations\nRabbi I'm Talking to rabbi ... sparrow who's known as worldwide as America's rabbi he's also the author of pushback reclaiming our American Judeo Christian eat those\nThe other thing you mentioned just in passing or you you you rushed to across was the issue of pushing them into somebody else's orbit and that is if you say well we'll cut off the Saudis I'm sure that the Russians and the Chinese would love to have an opportunity to bring Saudi Arabia into their orbit and you know what I mean rather than having them\nBe uh you know a a country that at least\nA you know that they have helped us out in both of the Gulf wars and other situations and currently they appear to be a you know they appear to be doing pretty well in in in broadening relations let's say with Israel which is is not a bad thing in the middle east we need our allies in that region don't\n... ... that's a very important point you make the size the economic aspect of it and they use the word orbit if we're not going to be selling these things to Saudi Arabia and China and Russia will ... will not just lose the economic part of it but that's the word orbit politically they will\nNo longer consider us an ally but they might allied themselves with Russia but with China and what that would do to the foreign policy and the ... of America or\nThat would just that could crush the world that is something that I just don't think that however drastic this is certainly terrible for the family and I'm sure that journalists were afraid\nBut I really wouldn't turn the world upside down over an out and who knows what it could lead to what type of brink of war this could than real language of powers I wouldn't do that over this one incident no\nNo and and your you know it's funny rabbi because I'm a big supporter of Israel is imagine you are as well and Iran is one of the primary forces against Israel funding all kinds of terrorist activities or you know through Syria and other places against Israel\nI'm sure the Iranians would love it too if the United states did not have this major ally of the Saudis because that means the United states ability to push back against Iran is also going to be impeded if\nWe don't have those allies and I'm I I look rabbi I also have questions about some of the Saudis role in some things that haven't been as good for the United states as well I don't see them as entirely on our side but on the other hand I'd rather have them well like Reagan used to say my ... my eighty percent a friend\nWho is not my twenty percent enemy or you you can't run things that way and if you decide on absolutes you kill a journalist we cut you off altogether you're going to end up with no friends at all\nYou know that's an important point I bet you you're going to hear in the coming days people on the left who number one wants to see Trump's foreign policy just disintegrate they want to see failure and certainly\nTwo if the United states did not have this major ally of the Saudis because that means the United states ability to push back against Iran is also going to be impeded if we don't have those allies and I might look rabbi I also have questions about some of the Saudis role in some things that haven't been as good for the United states as well I don't see them as\nEntirely on our side but on the other hand I'd rather have them well like Reagan used to say my ... my eighty percent a friend\nWho is not my twenty percent enemy or you you can't run things that way and if you decide on absolutes you kill a journalist we cut you off altogether you're going to end up with no friends at all\nYou know that's an important point I bet you you're going to hear the coming days people on the left school number one wants to see Trump's foreign policy just disintegrate they wanna see failure\nBaylor's admittedly this is a conspiracy theory and and I'm not I'm not one of those I I have days ... days but I Believe that call us with acting completely after being in the White House\nSo if he was and they encourage the idea is to listen to the interview to the the meeting between the two companies that as a as a raft of southern sense is\nThe first sentence that had nothing to do with it that it said\nIt was all over the place and mentally unstable but I don't believe in that way\nEven though he admitted to buy a polish ship and even though they last like Don Lemon look we're saying he has a mental problem and he needs to take care of him so I think he did it because people like you and your your right wing talking head with this thing\nIs like to see his defending is is is the St Louis\nHow liberal so he really because there's no ... I Am though he was mentally bonkers\nSee I don't think he was I Know in Iraq to\nWell okay you've asserted that let me make the argument to the counter All right that okay with you yeah sure I okay I Know\nI could interject before you do I like it address where the thing in the ... as soon as as the fish shouldn't man the seventh it should be a complete ...\nAnd he is I Know about in our own train of thought on take a breath and I'm going to respond and I'll put you on hold if I have to here's my answer directly to that point which you interrupted there are a lot of people I Know who communicate has kind of a stream of consciousness\nAnd one of them who I've mad and I admire greatly is Donald Trump if you listen to his speeches he will often start on one time\n... even though he was totally bonkers\nSee I don't think he was I Know a lot too\nWell okay you've asserted that let me make the argument to the counter or I thought okay with you yeah sure I'm okay I Know\nYou're just before you do I like it and just one thing in the ... the focus should live that said that it should be a complete\n... and he is I Know about in your own train of thought on take a breath and I'm going to respond and I'll put you on hold if I have to here's my answer directly to that point which you interrupted there are a lot of people I Know who communicate has kind of a stream of consciousness\nAnd one of them who I've met and I admire greatly as Donald Trump if you listen to his speeches he will often start on one tack he'll go to something else that may seem unrelated then they'll go to something else that I go to something else\nIt can be difficult to follow up but I think that's a style and and it's something that people do and I don't honestly think they have a lot of control over it I can do the same day sometimes I find myself down the rabbit hole because all start on tax policy\nI'll go to drug policy I'll go to talking about the wall and then and and if you're planning it well\nThen you may end up all the way wrapped around to something else like defense policy\nIt happens there are other times where I think at a very linear manner and I go from eight to beat to see and if I keep going all end up and see that's what you're saying is that somebody is crazy if they don't communicate in an entirely linear way in all instances\nI Will tell you something having sat in that same office not with President Trump although I Hope to one of these days but if you've never been in the oval office\nYou don't know how totally intimidating it can be and I would imagine even for a guy who's used to performing like Kanye West does that would be an intimidating experience you're in the oval office with the president\nYou're surrounded by what looks like about six does in his cameras and everything else and then you say gosh he didn't seem to be speaking from a set of notes or on a strict outline and he started at a\nAnd it as an L. and then went back to see and went off dizzy and came back to ... and ... you know that that if the fact that he wasn't going in a straight line shows he's crazy\nThen unfortunately an awful lot of us are probably crazy as well there are people and I know that some people I Know who are very smart who don't always talk in a linear fashion one of them is one of my best friends over forty years he's a prosecutor he's very smart\nBut he will sometimes start with one thing and they'll end up going down a rabbit hole and I will confess to having done it as well so\nGiven that and don't decide that he's crazy if you sit down and do what I encourage people to do and I've said this a few times today\nListen to what he said to where he talked about the lack of father\nFigures in families and that's something that's not a black or white issue\nIt is an issue for all families if you don't have a father figure in that family and they're very many households is is not disparaging single mothers raising kids it's a tough job to do but without a male figure there those kids miss out on something important and oftentimes\nEnded up going off the path he went from that to welfare\nAnd its influence I think an awful lot of what he said was actually very very conservative and that's why the media is going nuts on it let's go to Douglas and Douglas welcome to First Amendment friday what's on your mind\nIs how

have you back welcome to the program\nYou great to be with your Lars thank you\nBefore we get into this discussion about dark regulatory matter would you mind telling my audience what dark regulatory matter is uh\n[noise] yeah well you know dark matter\nIs often referred to as a the set of tools that the so called deep state court dark state choose to carry out their own agenda is sometimes independent of the intention of Congress or the administration that they're supposed to be working for and I'm\nIn the context of a regulatory agencies there are several kinds of of dark matter of ways that they can get around the specified procedures for carrying out their work so I'm One example is\nUm regulatory discretion and and that means that um they have discretion within what the law dictates that regulated industry or individuals must do and the the most egregious example of that with which your listeners will be familiar\nWas a then the FBI Director Comey's decision an announcement that I'm Hillary Clinton's transgressions with respect to a handling the email a privacy her private email server and so on\nDid not meet the criteria for prosecution in his opinion so that was discretion about whether there should be enforcement of the rules about the\nClassify handling classified information um but there there are all sorts of examples of ... in the in the regulatory community so I'm a ... for example a marijuana possession\nIs still a federal crime and yet not prosecuted at all in the amounts per individual used in states like Colorado and California so there's a good example of federal enforcement discretion better runs well\n... ... ... but at least they're they have I think it's called the Golan agreement there was actually drawn up by Obama that effectively said\nAll right the U.S department of justice will ignore this violation of federal law by these stage even though the drug is illegal federally will agree to not enforce it because the people in your state of agreed to make it legal for either ... medical or a or a a recreational use\nBut at least that was committed to a piece of paper so you could point to it and said that's what the agreement says it also says the agreement is null and void at the state allows a large amounts of contraband\nHot to be shipped out of his fate into other states that have not agreed to legalize it so at least those states get some protection but just some of this new regulatory dark matter\nAlso happened where discretion is used and there's no way to actually say well what is this additional discretion\nUh well it's it's as much as we decided to give whenever we decided to give it\nYeah well yeah and that's and that's the problem\nNor this violation of federal law by these states even though the drug is illegal federally will agree to not enforce it because the people in your state of agreed to make it legal for either ... medical or a or a a recreational use\nBut at least that was committed to a piece of paper so you could point to it and said that's what the agreement says it also says the agreement is now and void at the state allows a large amounts of contraband\nPot to be shipped out of the state and do other states that have not agreed to legalize it so at least those states get some protection but does some of this new regulatory dark matter\nAlso happened where discretion is used and there's no way to actually say well what is this additional discretion\nUh well it's it's as much as we decided to give whenever we decided to get\nYeah well yeah and that's and that's the problem a set of that I'm a FDA for example or does this all the time and had a good example is another\nKind of regulatory dark matter if it is a back up a little bit of a second kind of regulatory dark matter is the issuance of guidance documents or memoranda or announcements instead of formal role making formal role making specifies that there has to be an announcement on the federal register\nPublic comment consideration of public comment and then finally station of the of the rule but the agencies often get around that by issuing\nGuidance documents and then\nUh within the uh the guidance that they specify which is often new policy making new law making it really wasn't contemplated by Congress they can specify carve outs for enforcement discretion within that and that's\nSometimes a bridge too far too much of a ton of me that was never contemplated for ah for regulatory agencies and yet they do this they do this all the time some guidance I guess good so that for example if the ... as the ... medical a law\nThat says there have to\nBe a pre approval inspections of drug manufacturing a suitable manufacturing facilities but guidance documents can tell the industry\nWhat the nature of those are in a tablet Schmidt\nInspections will be do they have to be announced can they be unannounced are they supposed to avoid disrupting the pharmaceutical production\nOr how long should they last a should be the outcome on in terms of paperwork and so on so that's good but uh but sometimes guidance makes brand new policy\nWhich is far beyond what anyone contemplating and when that brings go ahead do and that and that brings up the\nSort of a conflict if you get regulatory agencies too much of a ton of money or you get them making new policies that are beyond what was intended if you give them too little you have found a unable to adjust\nTo situations new technologies new situation that might arise\nSo what's the best way of renting it in and and I guess well you tell me what you think the best way to rented in would be\nWell the best way to rein it in it as we've discussed in other context is for Congress to exercise and perform its oversight responsibilities I'm much better much\nMore strictly much more conscientiously than they do\nDoc I'll tell you this this stuff\nWhat anyone contemplated and it wasn't that please go ahead though and that and that brings up the\nSort of a conflict if you give regular tore agencies too much of a ton of money or you get them making new policies that are beyond what was intended if you give them too little you have them are unable to adjust\nTo situations new technologies new situation that might arise\nSo what's the best way of raining it in and and I guess well you tell me what you think the best way to rented in would be\nWell the best way to rent it in it as we've discussed in other context is for Congress to exercise and performance oversight responsibilities are much better much more strictly much more conscientiously than they do\nDock I'll tell you this this stuff drives me nuts because I guess I expect that people work in the federal government and poll of federal pay check out of the public treasury would the people of good\nFaith and to some extent I I imagine there are plenty of people who meet that description and then there are other people who seem to think my federal job is not just a great paycheck integrate pension\nBut his mind a license to go out and fix things to be the way I think they ought to be instead of the way that I'd been directed and I know that some of these people didn't like the choice of Donald Trump I\nBird glad to her and I read them [laughter] and uh and this was called Google's new ... and I actually talked about the fact that they have access to of course all of our personal information and there are thousands of people do go and thousands of people who work at Google's business partners we have\nA have free access to our profiles our emails I mean how can they resist\nSnooping they can't and now in in a Google employees have been caught doing very bad things with our data and of course we also now have a leak showing an internal discussion among Google employees about how they can fight Donald Trump's a you know immigration policy\nOr this isn't just from two thousand Seventeen so you know there there are people\nThey're just people frankly and I think it's dangerous\nYeah I I guess Dr I Know they're just people but\nFor example and I I really resist the idea that these should be turned into government government controlled utilities like a power company or a natural gas company I don't like that idea because I didn't get very quickly run up against the first amendment and I ... I Want to safeguard the first amendment for both the left and the right even though I'm On the right\nBut I think and tell me if this comparison isn't isn't appropriate I have friends who are cops I don't even call them and say would you give\nAnd of course we also now have a leak showing an internal discussion among Google employees about how they can fight Donald Trump's a you know immigration policy or this isn't just from two thousand Seventeen so you know there there are people\nThey're just people frankly and I think it's dangerous\nYeah I I guess Dr I Know they're just people but for example and I I really resist the idea that these should be turned into government government controlled utilities like a power company or a natural gas company I don't like that idea because I didn't get very quickly run up against the first amendment\nAnd I ... I Want to safeguard the first amendment for both the left and the right even though I'm On the right\nBut I think and tell me if this comparison isn't isn't appropriate I have friends who are cops I don't even call them and say would you give me the criminal background on someone if\nIt isn't public record already because I'm aware that the data systems they have access to ... would do that one is called the law enforcement data system you can plop and\nDr Robert Epstein and find out how many wants and warrants arrests and all kinds of other really salacious information might be available about Epstein her Larson or anyone else and I'm aware that there are there legal constraints on that I almost think there ought to be ethical concerns that are good cop\nShould say that data is for law enforcement only it is not for you know to be used by you to\nFigure out whether your girlfriend has you know an arrest from ten years ago or potential employee does unless it is public information and all those people who work in police agencies sometimes they break the rules to\nBut they're tough consequences when they do is say you're not supposed to be using the lead system for anything but law enforcement is there for a reason to catch bad guys and bad gals but it's not there for you to check on your boyfriend or your girlfriend\nYou know if we catch you're doing it it it's the end of your career is is Google prepared to beat that tough on employees who will break those rules\nAre well see there there's a big difference because you're talking about not just ethics you're talking about uh laws and regulations you're talking about accountability to the public and the problem is with Google Facebook to there are no laws there are no regulations and there's no accountability to the public there's accountability its share of shareholders\nWell or my you know my my views on this actually have changed I have to say over the years um I I used to\nStart to think about regulations and things like that and uh uh I I think it has really changed a a very guarding the search engine itself for example\nI mean you you don't like the idea of a public utility but the

the point I'm trying to make [noise] now I Am we vilified our own nation as being worse than any nation on earth ... and it's all connected to mass hysteria and groupthink\nWhich I carefully\nKind of uncomfortable here in in my book stop mass hysteria and I I Want to say one thing to uh to go into the book for one minute we don't have much time and I know people that write\nAnd having me on I've written political books and they've done very well in this book I Try to bridge politics with history and and I found out that a little history goes a long way such as saying that this bartender can you name one country on earth that was not salad and blood and conquest\nAnd it's instantaneous the answer say no I really can't and in doing that by learning a few things\nYou can probably turn

say no I really can't and in doing that by learning a few things\nYou can probably turn arguments with rational people now that's a big copy a rational people\nWrite that down and I think there are some people might want to ask me and so you engage with your audience what your caller is telling you about the deep divide between themselves your callers that they're conservative what are they telling you about that divide between themselves and their neighbors who might be ideologically opposed to them\n[laughter]\nYou can't see here's the problem I think the battle lines are drawn\nSaid before and unfortunately I see happening ... years ago wrote a book or stop becoming civil war you know now there's a becoming sort of a common thing like having another civil war you know uh I think the battle lines are drawn the Mason Dixon Line is very clear people on both sides families are divided just before the civil war\nAnd we'll we're waiting for a Fort Sumter and I think Dianne Feinstein was a living embodiment I'm a former Sumpter with a lipstick I've never seen anything like a woman trying to set a nation on fire as what she did to this man\nMy favorite show even ... than a third and fourth plane went down three so how about how his head\nIt's a big it's a big problem the history has been walked into everything white as bad everything American as bad because of the radicals took over the educational system a long time ago Common Core is still in most of the school systems\nAre Trump was supposed to eliminate it on their education secretary divorced it's still there you know there's a lot of issues here that we we can go into my point in writing stop mass hysteria is to try to give people pieces of history that they can use as soundbites\nTo try to get a rational discussion going\nIn their own family and people who disagree with them that we don't even know the history of the country yeah you know my show I mean you're asking a big question why do they think I don't know what the opposition thinks that America is the worst place on earth and then anyone white is an evil racist how did this ... how did this happen\nI've out and has happened that would make the point that a person like a Palestinian terrorists Linda saucer or my opinion of Palestinian terrorists can lead a women's march and call a Susan Collins a white supremacist because of her vote however we reached this point that any one of them that low caliber would be taken seriously by the media\nYeah no it Michael it's a great point who is speaking of hysteria and it goes to the part of the title of your book about the ... let's talk about the current which on the Russia collusion probe\nIn quotes led by special counsel Robert Mueller notice it very chilling to me and the Gina as people who have worked on political campaigns engaged in campaign strategy so now Mueller's team Michael is reportedly investigating Republican researcher Peter Smith\nSmith raised about a hundred thousand dollars to find Hillary Clinton's emails the wall Street Journal is reporting that Mueller is interested in Smith because he told the people\nThat he tried to recruit that he was connected to several Trump campaign officials including guys like Seattle Michael Flynn\nSays Smith is a hundred thousand dollars from for investors on top of the fifty thousand dollars he himself put in to me and like all this chilling because this looks like motors attempt to criminalize\nStandard old campaign strategies but even worse first protected political donations and opposition research because the wrong guy won the election I mean it is not the definition of hysteria\nWhere Mueller when I first started with the Russia collusion which fell apart and I'm so you arrested people who did commit crimes unrelated to Trump and now he's going after the campaign individuals\nSmith raised about a hundred thousand dollars to find Hillary Clinton's emails the wall Street Journal is reporting that Mueller is interested in Smith because he told people\nThat he tried to recruit that he was connected to several Trump campaign officials including guys like Seattle Michael Flynn\nSays Smith is a hundred thousand dollars from for investors on top of the fifty thousand dollars he himself put in to me and Michael this is chilling because this looks like motors attempt to criminalize\nStandard old campaign strategies but even worse first protected political donations and opposition research because the wrong guy won the election I mean it is not the definition of hysteria\nLook where Mueller when first started with the Russia collusion which fell apart and I'm so you arrested people who did commit crimes unrelated to Trump and now he's going after the campaign individuals for things they did that as you say are legal buddies dropped the Russia collusion investigation\nWhich led us not forget was his original mandate in other words there was a ball field was parameters on it\nAnd the perimeters war Russia collusion well now he's branched into anything he wants to condemning anyone he wants he is now a law unto themselves and I believe it's long overdue that Trump's fire Mueller frankly\nMueller has greatly exceeded the mandate that he was given this is the kind of persecution that destroys the nation so to answer your question of course is violating the ban civil rights mhm now where wherever we stop it's like the guillotine who's next\nKnowing that way will now arrest somebody on Fox News who had Donald Trump on his show too many times is that the next thing say that's collusion between the media and Donald Trump is that in our crime on the on the Robert Mueller\nI've seen that way Michael\nAnd we only have like a second term any but I really want to get to that because I think there were all on the Internet envision today and how to branch that gap\nOn Twitter and Facebook I have to watch my back every step of the way and after carefully Fred phrase when I phrased because they could take me down any minute long overdue week we have a Federal Communications commission don't wait that ... supposedly overlooks TV radio stuff right FCC\nWhy don't we have the equivalent why don't we just role in the social media outlets into the FCC and make them answer to them there needs to be some constraints on them\nBecause they're too big to operate as independent businesses they are and now a public utility and in the sense as a public utility they need to have some kind of controls on them so they cannot an act of censorship that we're seeing for example by Jack Dorsey on Twitter takes anyone down he doesn't like\nIt's time to roll Twitter and Facebook Google the others into the federal communication system FCC laws allowed that's I think that's a good first step is very simple\nKind of the free market tens of thousands of fat if I call waiting for like a painting that today backup rock like here buck stop mass hysteria not necessarily

we need to carry with us at all times and to have that in our arsenal of um [noise] yes and I don't live in\nI Believe that we should have in our arsenal of supplements is the digestive health so if you could go to us a little bit about digestion\nOK Jen good point okay another thing that you could buy one bottle and then break it up into little\nPackages and you're a person in your car and your work desk and you know in your home so this digestive enzymes land is extremely effective for everyone okay so we have a raw abroad plants in fact\nDigestive enzymes first of all that's it from second of all we have added some ... route and some than all\nAnd some ginger okay views are really really good anti inflammatory than anti accident alright additionally what makes this a showstopper\nTwo hundred and fifty unit of deep you can use for\nHealth so if you can go to is a little bit about digestive\nOK Jen good point okay another thing that you could buy one bottle and then break it up into little\nPackages and you're a person in your car and your work desk and you know in your home so this digestive enzymes land is extremely effective\nFor everyone okay and so we have a Raul brought plants about some of the digestive enzymes first of all that's it we'll second of all we have added some ... route and some federal\nAnd some ginger okay views are really really good anti inflammatory and anti oxygen alright additionally what makes this a showstopper is\nTwo hundred and fifty unit\nOf deep you paid for and for listeners that don't know what the piece for is is simply put it's\nA gluten digesting in time or it can be called a ... or it can be called approach TA okay the bottom line is just remember the peace for and it's a it's the ivy to a Roman numeral VP for losing digestive enzymes\nAlso attacks like isn't\nIt also is attacking album in any way\nSo for anybody that may have issues with those kind of kind of common allergens or things like that but especially lieutenant ugly out and the ... is what the the ... people are attacking so most of the time\nPeople that manifesto the actors these are people that manifest um autism spectrum disorder have really really low levels of natural the peace for digesting enzyme gluten digest the enzymes in their system so\nThis is really good for somebody ... those those two are people that are are are being suffering from not you know what I'm saying but anybody also that maybe eating something better than the equipment tolerance or they have to impeach a far D fact in so they really um have a low\nTolerance to toxins and stop so digestive enzymes within these people for their is very very effective\nSo that is the beauty of our digesting our our digestive health I'm In a lot of people don't understand or know about the TTP orbited the extremely affected or yeah everyone\nWell yeah in fact Jennifer our just talking or just even about anybody with auto immune issues and ... you know and has been a trigger for in a lot of those and a lot of people don't realize the sensitivities even that they may have to it and so I Love it this formula has that in there um\nThat probably almost everyone should be taking it pretty much I Know everything yeah looting free and I'm like well how do you know what's your you know pull intolerance or ... or sensitive and that's what the\nDiscussion was smart enough besides the good morning how are you [laughter] so it's something that Jamie nice to talk about but um and it and I agree everybody should be taking a digestive enzyme I mean I don't care what I\nI yeah I absolutely agree because I'm a big deal it after it's too late okay and because there's so many common allergens that are out there especially in the Americas and you're in our United States we have so many common allergens are affecting everybody's daily digestion\nThat it's affecting their immune system and we know that there that the guy is not any more than Ninety percent and ...\nEveryone should be taking it pretty much I Know everything yeah gluten free and I'm like well how do you know if you're you know pull intolerance or are sensitive and that's what the\nDiscussion was smart enough besides the good morning how are you [laughter] why it is something that Jamie nice to talk about but um and it and I agree everybody should be taking a digestive enzymes I mean I don't care what I\nAsked her I yeah I absolutely agree because I'm a big deal it after it's too late okay and because there's so many common allergens that are out there especially in the in the Americas and you're in our United States we have so many common allergens are affecting everybody's daily digestion\nThat it's affecting their immune system and we know that that that that guy\nIs money more than Ninety percent in charge of our immune system so if we look at this vicious cycle that's happening all the time of the foods that we eat that aren't clean enough that we just have to get in any way there aren't clean enough for our bodies the handle or to digest properly mhm we're looking at issue\nWe're looking at a lot of discomfort we're looking at a lotta aches and pains that are also going to need to inflammation like silent inflammation\nAnd the Senate and they should we know it's going to lead to elevated humble Fifteen issue which is going to we I I mean I can just go on and on and you know that\nBut oh I Would do in the system [laughter] I should we need to have you um\nYeah next time you come through Arizona let us know we need to have a a lecture series at our store here and had were leading our customers that would be actually to have you been yeah and I love\nDoing the lectures it's actually on the methylation and be a ... it all ties together it says the U.S their kids and it's supposed to be the best running show on earth right [laughter]\nAnd then honestly reading\nGreat otherwise is the worst show on earth and so I Love doing the consumer lectures and jet and you just sat in on the dinner training that we did last a couple of weeks ago in Arizona correct\nYes I did mhm yeah yeah yeah and we had a great\nInformational educational type\nAlthough yeah so am I what are you guys want to talk about like Joe ... let me talk\nLet me just let me just clear up really quick on the title of the benefits for the consumers\n... under twenty dollars especially as a daily okay the coins and needed multiply are the ones that need to be an Albion feel even minerals okay then we've got ... an additional ... them and they're All right so the bottom line is where it daily for people to understand is\nThis is in a capsule it\nDissolves within two minutes to the whole process is to get into them coastal lighting ... into the bloodstream whom want it to be utilized\nAlso common allergen three you can read an additive place and then also ... ... a multi vitamin line everything that Dr ... has created they all sit in a wrongful group were hired to replenish so what we're looking for then is\nEverything that Dr things or has created it all that you know raw well what type of thing so what we're looking for then it at the direction and increasing the viability with a ... okay sticking to understand yeah\nYeah absolutely because when you're boosting metabolism in a a natural way in a safe manner it's not going to go beyond you're not going to become malnourished or or lose too much weight or start you\nKnow metabolizing your muscles this is just going to balance digestion and balance your metabolism\nAnd it's going to happen over time you know we expected um you know with any good probiotic people can lose weight just from the increased elimination and proper digestion\nI'm so we expected that you know slow weight loss a pound or two a month but we have some amazing testimonies I have a lady from Florida that threatening us testimony that lost over fifty pounds and she had only been taken at six months when she told us that\nUm so that was a couple of months ago so we should be getting that testimony and\nI'm so for every individual it's going to vary you know I wouldn't say that everybody's going to lose fifty pounds in six months because there's a lot of variables you know um\nWhere you're starting point as your your genetics there's so many variables when it comes to weight loss um but this is something that can be good for everybody whether you need to lose five pounds or fifty um it's a safe approach that is going to have a lot of um exterior benefits as well\nGreat when we got all of the week not that great products here so I'm for any of our listeners that want to have more information just give us a call come on by now Justin on tell us a little bit also about the tri active by ... and Dan yeah so this is in the red Sox I call right\nSo the reason we came out with the advance care is because we had a lot of people using our original attractive ...\nUm that had more severe signs of 'em got despite all this and the bad bacteria over grow so\nThis was the most aggressive approach to correct that and to proliferate good bacteria I'm In the strongest men or that you could take you know that you couldn't have happened from one pill a day I'm so we use the sixteen strained blend of micro encapsulated probiotics I'm with a full\nBalance of this bacterium and lactobacillus strains\nUm we've had just great testimonies with this product and the nice thing is those customers who are taking the original to try to correct those symptoms and taking more pills um they were up to take in three pills a day as reckless\nRight so the reason we came out with the advance care is because we had a lot of people using our original attracted buyout ex\nUm that had more severe signs of 'em got despite all this and the bad bacteria over grow\nSo this was the most aggressive approach to correct that and to proliferate good bacteria I'm In the strongest men or that you could take you know that you can have happened from one pill a day I'm so we use the sixteen strained blend of micro encapsulated probiotics I'm with a full\nBalance of this bacterium and lactobacillus strains\nUm we've had just great testimonies with this product and the nice thing is those customers who are taking the original to try to correct those symptoms and taking more pills\nUm they were up to take in three pills a day as recommended by their a nutritionist ... doctor and that was costing upwards of a hundred dollars a month to be on that formula and take that stronger dosage\nAbout what the advance care are retail price was able to be set at just a forty nine Ninety five and I believe it healthy habit you guys have a a pretty big discount on those in my right\nYes we are such that we have it at thirty nine Ninety five oh awesome\nOkay so twenty percent off um that's a great price point and uh you know again it's just one pill a day and uh that's something we focus on as well as trying to make it a convenient dose that everyone will remember to take as recommended\n\n... you know you had mentioned when you're talking about what that means\nYes I'm a good question to the micro calculation I talk about it so much sometimes I forget that there's people that don't understand what that means I'm this is a really cool technology it's patented technology that comes from a company called pro by article out of Italy\nAnd they have this the euro gravity machine that the strains were actually suspended and then a\nA vegetable glitter always sprayed around them\nTo create and and caring coating around the strengths himself um so the material comes to us in a powder form but it's actually the strains with\nIndividual coating around the strain so that they can get through the um harmful area of the stomach harmful to probiotic um which is the stomach acid\nRight\nSo um tell me a little bit about\nWho I should recommend this product who you know because we have so many customers coming in and they all I I Swear jumping have got issues so right yeah so which one should I recommend the advance here over like just the other one which is just your\n... uh every day I'm the green box on me\n[laughter] right right the green box that's okay to call them that a lot of people here so the green boxes the original formula um and\nThat is the best one for the average person 'cause really everybody should be on a good probiotic nowadays especially um you know with the influx of antibiotics in our food and so many\nConditions that um caused detriment to the good bacteria even you know taking and said I'm On a semi regular basis has actually been shown to kill off the good bacteria in your gut\nSo the green one is the ... the a recommended for the average person and anyone who has severe signs of San Diego over growth or um ... syndrome those are the are the people that we usually recommend the advance care for\n'em a lot of people don't always attribute the symptoms\nSo the green boxes the original formula um and that is the best one for the average person 'cause really everybody should be on a good probiotic nowadays especially um you know with the influx of antibiotics in our food and so many\nConditions that um caused detriment to the good bacteria even you know taking and said I'm On a semi regular basis has actually been shown to kill off the good bacteria in your guts\nSo the green one is the ... the ah recommended for the average person and anyone who has severe signs of can veto over growth or um ... syndrome those are the are the people that we usually recommend the advance care for\n'em a lot of people don't always attribute the symptoms that they're getting to a bad bacteria over growth because it doesn't seem like it's coming from your stomach you know chronic\nFatigue fibromyalgia um eczema psoriasis these are all conditions that can stem from bad bacteria over growth\nAnd once the bad bacteria become prominent and make those holes in the they actually grow roots through the intestinal walls um that's what causes that they're leaking those inflammatory triggers and toxins into our bloodstream which can then affect major organs\nSo for those people with um auto auto immune conditions and things like that that could have developed from ... um that's definitely who we would recommend to be on the advance care\nAnd once once those symptoms have decided um the advance care is something that you can actually stepped down from one of the lesser strength formulas um they're after but some people decided they want to stay on that one which is perfectly safe as well\nAnd um I I really like it has its shelf stable because I'm just I'm a little ... so everybody just punch one now and then you take it immediately once you once you know because then the air gets at it so\nIt's really great to travel with and it's great to not forget to take your a probiotic because it's right there with the rest of your supplements so\nThank you so much for coming up with that a shelf stable product\nYeah we're always looking for unique technologies you know right when we started the company we had the the dissolving film the edible film strips with the beat twelve strips\nAnd we haven't stopped looking for unique technologies that have a higher level of benefit and we've been able to apply those in categories that really have been needed so it's been really rewarding for that reason\nRight and I'm a little bit more about maybe your other products Jackson\nYeah um I did want to talk about our uh hemp extract a little bit today because that is a category that the more I learned in the more I hear from uh the consumers that have taken the products that this is one of the most important natural product categories we have\nUm we actually had the ability um through one of our a contract manufacturers to start working with CBD products about four years ago but decided to stay out of the category just because of all the legal lines that were being drawn\nUm we contacted a law firm that had a lot of experience in the category I'm hoping law group and they're right on the front lines um you know\nKind of trying to protect this industry and we brought them on board and they kind of guided us into the category\nSo our products called synergy spectrum P. C. R. M. P. C. R. stands for federal cannabinoid rich\nAnd that's what CBD is is a vital cannabinoid I'm there about a hundred different cannabinoids in the ... plant\nInstead of taking the product that this is one of the most important natural product categories we have um we actually had the ability um through one of our a contract manufacturers to\nStart working with CBD products about four years ago but sided to stay out of the category just because of all the legal lines that were being drawn\nUm we contacted a law firm that had a lot of experience in the category I'm hoping law group and they're right on the front lines um you know\nKind of trying to protect this industry and we brought them on board and they kind of guided us into the category\nSo our products called synergy spectrum P.

have another accident and I said ... you have a little tiny house how ... how ... will be so high\nI said there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and heart goes from a PS and ... because a the estimates are people had some news or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake ... let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nThis is the house that she's going to be in for another twenty or twenty five years and this power bills never going down it's never going to go away and it's never going down the only thing it's gonna do you keep on increasing [noise]\nI said I've got to help the help help her out here I couldn't pay it and I couldn't pay that month and I couldn't pay the next month for the months after that\nI had to figure out a solution for her so I rolled up my sleeves and I started looking online lower electric bills lower power bills I lead the lights came up super cooling came up\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah\nIt is the hottest I'm of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this is because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five ... there's\nUsually never just stay regular one two three ten\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM\nIt is the hardest time of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this is because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest some of the day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\n... there's no place to go except to them on and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that too right in them all ... and it's not fair that power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it so the smart energy management the way that the analogy that people like like that I've been told\nIs remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance Monday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay it a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were known more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist met her when we called me long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when the hundred and Fifteen degrees up there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you've consumed at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan it is to me and I do get wound up up up this and I get very upset about it is\n... ... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you and I say the power companies have a license to steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay younger ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it it's a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked\nIn for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS ... people want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power it will not affect you anymore\nUm I say that the power companies thank you and I said the power companies have a license to steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay Yun ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay for a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked\nIn for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you anymore so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's going to continue to go off\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them\nAnd I explain all this to them so not only are you paying between seven and half of neat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying towards the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um\n... it just it doesn't make sense for them they can you remember rates everybody should just call you just find out how to read\nTheir bill and then I don't know how to read their ... and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if you go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people who will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site and I do a rate I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again\nAnd I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half\nAnd today there is out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time and then they go home now I understand what she ran and so no judgments but at the end of the day we\nHave an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simply this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty well you're going to go over here\nFor almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half and one of the natives out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go home now you understand what she runs\nAnd so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here in the heat you fifty and that's essentially Carol\nI'm sending people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS Messer piece rate puns today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home where you between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid for the power company\nCut that in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money well here's what we're\nGoing to do we want to give out your phone number because everyone really should just

immediately be back on adrenal house 'cause it is I I tell everybody it's my favorite product my very favorite\nProduct that brings up point what since you are you pregnant and slash lactate in that Dr singer had specific advice for women and it was it was it was kind of a little surprised me when he told us but can you share what he said about how to approach if you're pregnant how you look at supplement\nBasically the the thing is is that a lot of things are determined whether or not it's really cool to take it if you're pregnant or not based on testing but how many pregnant ladies are lining up to do these tests\nSo it's not necessarily that these things are harmful it's just that there's not enough evidence to say whether or not it's ideal for you to take it during pregnancy so\nWhen I asked Dr singer when I was trying to get pregnant and I asked him you know here I Am taking you know my mom's I Am taking adrenal I'm taking X. Y. and see what can I continue to take and he said you can take you know your adrenal until you find out that you are pregnant but beyond that\nIt's not been tested all some of the herbs have not been tested for whether or not it's safe to take during pregnancy so that being said you know he just airs on the side of caution and but as soon as I'm done I'm going to be back on that because my adrenal need a little pick me up\nRight so the default position from Dr ... perspective if there are not safety studies showing that you can take this during pregnancy\nYou can't take it in his opinion so it some are women right there are two ... pregnancy never an issue that very well could be but he says the zero studies showing the safety during pregnancy equal you can't take it as a doctor that's what he would say because you have to err on the side of being super cautious\nBut so it doesn't mean if you took it you've done harm but a lot of something to say or if there is no choice throwing harm I can take it pregnancies kind of the other way\nI and so it's just being a\nSome of the herbs have not been tested for whether or not it's safe to take during pregnancy so that being said you know he just airs on the side of caution and but as soon as I'm done I'm going to be back on that 'cause my adrenal need a little pick me up\nRight so the default position from Dr singers perspective if there are not safety studies showing that you can take this during pregnancy\nYou can't take it in his opinion so it some women right there are two real hope all through my pregnancy narrowed an issue that very well could be but he says the zeroes studies showing the safety during pregnancy equal you can't take it as a doctor that's what he would say because you have to err on the side of being super cautious\nBut so it doesn't mean if you took it and you've done harm but a lot of something to do or if there is no choice throwing harm I can take a pregnancy is kind of the other way\nRound I and so it's just being abundantly cautious and by you know during pregnancy and I will say because I'm Still taking these things now that I'm breastfeeding I\nTake the prenatal um I just really love our our Maltese are phenomenal and the Maltese are safe so like if you're taking a you know the standard multiply or the two a day or the prenatal um the high potency the one in daily completes those are all great during pregnancy\nUm see him as a women's you can take those I take the three because I Know that I'm deficient in ... Dr singer actually tested me I also take coconut oil because I like the immune benefit I also take ... to trade so I get some extra calcium and magnesium\nSo I take ... yeah so I take the ha as well so that's really good for the baby and it's good for me as well so but there's limited things and to be healthy is a great formulated take too if you're pregnant you can take the healthy certainly so\nBut it just limits what you take and and you know if you're not sure you can always talk to you it's really good if you can talk to a nature path physician because you know my lovely it's the same job and when she was pregnant she literally had a doctor tell her that there was no point in taking a prenatal and I was like\nThat's just you know and it's free and it just it just it just depends on

embrace anybody here at the twenty teens annual meeting for the society of Clinical Oncology which they can in Canada and author here within scientist unleashing the immune system to kill\nCancer you mentioned a checkpoint inhibitors and some specific treatments that I mean a therapy and you were printed on this for many years so what what else besides that excites an impressive the when looking at the available in the new one called treatments that are currently available\nThe one that is most intriguing to me a ... refer to his car T cells and what that stands for his crime Eric and didn't receptor T cells\nThis is some really exotic stuff um what they do is is uh they take the T cells that of your immune system the T cells are basically the assassins have your immune system\nThey take them out of you the cancer patients they look at your tumor and see what kind of target you have on your show over\nThere then genetically engineer your T cells in a dish to recognize that target the then grow up those cells to several billion and they shoot him back into\nThat the drug the drug will only work on you there your yourselves won't work on any other patient than their tailored precisely to you and if they work\nOr the again people are talking about being cures and this drug uh that sweet of drugs in design for what are called blood cancers\nThis is some really exotic stuff um what they do is is uh they take the details that have your immune system the T cells are basically the assassins of your immune system\nThey take them out of you the cancer patients they look at your tumor and see what kind of target you have on your show over there then genetically engineer your T cells in a dish to recognize that target the then grow up those cells to several billion and they shoot him back into you\nThat's the drug the drug will only work on you there your yourselves won't work on any other patient and then there are tailored precisely to you and if they work\nOr the again people are talking about being George and this drug a suite of drugs inches on for what are called blood cancers of lymphoma in leukemia\n... it's even more interesting to me is that unlike a checkpoint inhibitor which is a fixed thing um crunchy soldier more like software\nIn that it's like you know there'll be where you can you can updated and you could add things you can put ... expert sheets on it you can put all kinds of things on it so\nThat not only in the drug imminently adaptable it's also a live this is a living drug or\nIt circulates in your system it is you know the yourselves and and it's really the sky's the limit the do creativity that's gone into creating these drugs and developing these drugs extraordinary\nSidestep from that question how important the development of novel diagnostic approaches and cancer therapy\nYeah I'm a referred to the checkpoint inhibitors again um there's two reasons why the diagnostics are important one is is a straight a business reason these drugs are very expensive\nUh and if you don't have to target a insurance companies would like to not pay for you to take them and you know patients shouldn't take things aren't going to work\nUm with this target looked for real it to say with a checkpoint he recalled a anti pd one pd one of the target and is on tumor cells and\nIf you test positive for that it depends how positive you are as to how well the drug in my work if you're fifty percent or twenty five percent or one percent is you're no present it probably won't work\nBut we're still it's a lot of gray area there because there is now data that shows in some cancer types if you have you if the targets not detectable at the drugs that works at least a little bit\nI'm there I don't I couldn't tell you how many presentations or this ask a meeting looking at how\nCan we determine who to treat and and what drove to treat a it's extraordinarily complex um but there are any number of tests going on right now of actually there was a genetic tests that that came out today which is ... therapy called ... a tailored effects\nAnd this is a genetic test it's in breast cancer and it will tell you very specifically whether or not you need more chemotherapy\nUh yeah and it's it's it will save women suffering from having to take human therapy that they don't need and it will save a lot of money um but all the all these all these tests are coming\nSending out in your book called the care within scientist unleashing the immune system to kill\nLooking at how can we determine who to treat and and what drove to treat a it's extraordinarily complex\nUm but there are any number of tests going on right now of actually there was a genetic tests that that came out today which is sites that for me a therapy called ... a tailored effects\nAnd this is a genetic test it's in breast cancer and it will tell you very specifically whether or not you need more chemotherapy\nAh yeah and it's it's it will save women suffering from having to take human therapy that they don't need and it will save a lot of money um but all the all these all these tests are becoming\nSend you and your book called the care within scientist unleashing the immune system to kill cancer you write about the tenacious you scientists to refute banned in novel scientific concept but that's based entirely on interviews medical researchers and it tells the story of pioneers in college and\nSo first off what inspired you to write this book\nOf well it's it's sort of a funny story\nI'm I'm as you pointed out I'm a veteran journalist um but someone hired me a few years ago I'm not work for a company\nAnd the reason that person hired me is because of my journalism experience she thought that I had a an insight with what are called key opinion leaders who are the most important doctors at the meeting and usually they're most knowledgeable or respect and\nUh and could I hire them to speak to that are in their investors about something called this cancer immunotherapy and I'm like well sure I jumped at the chance why not\nBut at the time I really didn't know that much about cancer immunotherapy so I immediately ran off to a meeting and listen to a man named ... ... a shark is the father of the car to sell to that I was just describing\nAnd he's an older man he's Israeli and I went up to ... it's a it's talk I said you know that was fascinating but I if I could get your contact information because I you know for follow up questions\nAnd other things that oh no no it isn't on gums or get it and I I Will show you and he grabs my notebook and and he starts drawing something I don't know what he's doing and it's with tremendous flourish and then he headed back to me and it goes uh you should bring this I'm famous\nAnd I looked at it and it's a picture of a mouse\nAnd ... he's like all his work was done in mice its own unique to know\nAnd so I took him in his word and my friend it and I put it on my desk and then I started bringing in a experts in immunotherapy to speak to our investors more of them was ... who's the head of music therapy John talking and he sees them thing on my desk skills that guy's really famous\nAs well you want to do when he goes for jobs and injured animal cartoon from and I I find it\nAnd then another speaker came in ... named Tony ... who's at UCLA and ... those guys really famous like or you want to do yeah yeah I Want to do it and kept going on for a couple of years until I head over forty of these things and they're all arrayed around my desk 'cause I'm a nerd and I like these cartoons\nAnd then my boss comes walking by one day and he practically whispered in my ear because you realize these are all the streets for a book right\nAnd I can order him because they didn't want to write a book and then he did it two more times or realize okay not only is he right he really wants me to do this and then well two and a half years later there we are\nNot the most typical way to be inspired to write a book but I'm sure you were further inspired and learned a lot longer\nWhen he goes for jobs and Andrew did and we'll cartoon from and I and I find it\nAnd then another speaker came in ... named Tony ... who's at UCLA and he has those guys really famous like uh you want to do yeah yeah I Want to do it and it kept going on for a couple of years until I had over forty of these things and they're all arrayed around my desk 'cause I'm a nerd and I like these cartoons\nAnd then my boss comes walking by one day and he practically whispered in my ear because you realize these early stations for a book right\nAnd I know because they didn't want to write a book and then he did it two more times are real it's okay not only is he right he really wants me to do this and then well two and a half years later there we are\nMaybe not the most typical way to be inspired to write a book but I'm sure you were further inspired and learned a lot along the way which brings me to my next question tell us about about the people you interviewed for the buck and what stands out\nWell there's there's so many things I mean one thing that really hit me one night was I wasn't so much writing about\nWell that was the right in the butt of family\nThese people are fiercely loyal to each other and there's not that many of them I mean the poor people that that executed this technology is probably a hundred worldwide they all know each other some of them are married to each other or the\nDark stream retired I was talking to Marcella moss who's head of ... therapy at my at Mass General and she has children she goes yeah you know I have kids and but I'm I'm not close to these people who I Am to my own family so it was extremely striking a another aspect stands out as these people are extremely creative\nOr there are painters there are people who are in a band called the checkpoints and they're really good I mean Jim Alison chapter one played with Willie Nelson he plays armonica\nUh there there were so many of them refer to oh yeah I I'm I wanted to be a caterer wouldn't be a writer and ... and it didn't hit yeah the creativity of the science I mean it's drawing from all different disciplines to produce these remarkable drugs\nI'm ... I mean just overall it was struck by just how fascinating and neat and funny these people are\nI mean I only one of them I can think of who I won't name was a difficult person the rest of them are really sweet and extremely passionate about what they do\nWe're going to take a break now we'll get right back into our discussion with Neal Canada and author of the care within scientist unleashing the immune system to kill cancer here at the twenty Eighteen annual meeting citizens idea of Clinical Oncology\n\nEach day researchers make new discoveries they bring it closer to the moment when all cancer patients can become survivors [noise]\n\nEach day researchers make new discoveries they bring the closer to the moment when all cancer patients can become survivor [noise]\nIn this\nIn many cases will wake up your immune system this unfortunately this technology is still in its learning stadiums uh they've been doing that cancer vaccines for many years and they've been ineffective for many years\nThey are now starting to see responses because the underline science of how the vaccines work is being revealed how ... cells pick up the antigens how they're expressed how they go into the church UCR and so on [noise]\nUm I mean that's that's part and parcel with the entire field is that\nAll gee is extraordinarily complex\nAnd we know I don't know twenty five percent of how actually works\nUm vaccines work great on paper and a half in most of the time and people that don't\nBut they're working very very hard on that there is now something called a needle adage in vaccines which is very exotic technology it's it's genetic engineering it's genetic sequencing a Steve Rosenberg at the end of age it's like the king of that sort of thing\nUm and again these vaccines that are being developed a\nAre so exquisitely that again they will only work on you especially the new the new um\nThen you'll have to vaccines um there's a lot to learn there's a lot to learn but they are seen\nProgress that lives Jaffe in the book she has patients pancreatic cancer patients who should have been dead years ago [noise] um they're still jogging along and that's because of the vaccine work but she's been\nGoing back to me now to therapy um what are some of the biggest challenges now that researchers faith in their work\nUm [noise]\nWell they're sort of a luxury problem\nIn that with the checkpoint inhibitors the what everyone wants to do is to combine it with something else\nSo the checkpoint inhibitors work maxim only about thirty percent of cases which is you know you'd liked for it to work for everybody\nAnd the only way they know to expand that right now is charged combine it with some more traditional agents and some of that will be combinations with the poisonous\nPatients who should have been dead years ago [noise] um there are still chugging along and that's because of the vaccine work but she's been\nGoing back to me now to therapy um what are some of the biggest challenges now that researchers faith in their work\nUm [noise]\nThey're well they're sort of a luxury problem\nIn that with the checkpoint inhibitors the would everyone wants to do is to combine it with something else\nSo the checkpoint inhibitors work a maximum only about thirty percent of the cases which is you know you'd liked for it to work for everybody\nAnd the only way they know to expand that right now is search combine it with some more traditional agents and some of that will be combinations the poisons of the past the various ... therapies\nAre the problem with that is there's a lot of chemotherapy is out there are there are a lot of targeted therapies out there and\nThe result in a lot of money driving the technology and the result is there are hundreds I think I think the last count as over twelve hundred clinical trials are being proposed are under way using a checkpoint whoever plus agent acts\nIn just about any tumor types\nIn this has become\nA problem or the rush to combine them with things it's producing some spectacular failure it's one of which was which was reported today for a a a um an immunotherapy drug called ... it's called at the catalyst that\nAnd it was combined with a checkpoint inhibitor and it was a disaster that did it produced nothing other than more side effects and this was a very expensive trial and involved a lot of people and ... and\nYeah it was it was a problem and just logistically\nThere's no way I saw slide I ... I think these needles or a hundred and twenty thousand patients to do even you know half of these trials that have been proposed\nAnd it's just not possible so you have to drill down into the science and really really understand why are you doing this you can't just as someone put it in a recession today you can't just throw spaghetti at a wall and see what sticks\nUh it's it's too expensive and in and really to the patient is cruel um so the science some of the science is just not there and the example this morning with this at the cat is that they don't understand the science of of that targets enough\nThey and they're going to have to go back to what\nWe're going to take a break now we'll get right back into our discussion with your candidate author of the carrots and scientist at least when the immune system to kill cancer here at the twenty Eighteen annual meeting say this side of Clinical Oncology\n\n\nDoctor Angela Davis show associate professor at the ...

I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident\nAnd I said ... you have a little tiny house how could you her view however build these so high\nI said there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and ... and ... as a business or people had some users the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake cutting let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nSecret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management and let me talk about that we see on our built this thing called demand and a lot of people an ape you this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe Thirteen point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rape plans selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hardest time of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest summer day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before\nOr maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three ten\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hardest time of the day between three and have him and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest some of the day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\n... there's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it so the smart energy management the way that the analogy that people like like that I've been told\nIs remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your landline to call long distance Monday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were known more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would beat they were making money hand over fist met her when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when the hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added on to our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you've consumed at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty four cents that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... ... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you and I say the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other one of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it it's a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS semester if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on what\nI Know we're not looking not on the hill but yes Facebook yes linked in years Twitter yes

don't want to talk early\nVoting and I want to talk about potential scandal coming out to I Want to start with\nThe first thing early voting my friend Alan Cohen he's an expert on guns one of the preeminent experts on guns on fire arms on rules and regulations in what you need to know about your Second Amendment he's a phenomenal writer phenomenal speaker entertaining educational\nAnd he's got some thoughts about our elections\nIn Arizona folks I don't know about your state how many early voters you get but in the last cycle Seventy five percent of the folks were mailing early ballot voters yes Seventy fibers that that's frightening to me\nListen I Do fill out my early ballot form but guess what\nI typically don't do it 'til the day I go in why because I Want to\nMake sure I understand everything that's going on I also want to see if something comes up I also want to see if something happens to my candidate that I don't like what I'm hearing and I encourage you [laughter]\nBased upon Alan Cohen and our Second Amendment that you especially hold off when we're talking about our US Senate race here in Arizona\nAnd just about well many other tight races in our nation\nCan't say more than that I Wish I had the information to share with you today but there might be something breaking very soon so hold on to your\nBelt and guess what folks you know sometimes during the election day the lines are really long and you don't like standing in line waiting to drop off your belt guess what you can drop off a sealed filled out ballot signed ballot without waiting in line you just go in and you drop it off into the proper place\nYes that's it\nSo before you head out you can go and you want to have to wait in line isn't that great Mm yeah it is I really do like to wait\nAnd speaking of waiting I Know some people that are Trump supporters are upset with Martha McSally for what reason I Do not know I get it I get it because\nDuring the primaries she might not have stood out and said she was supporting Donald J Trump for president in the United states uh\nWhat folks you know sometimes during the election day the lines are really long and you don't like standing in line waiting to drop off your ballot guess what you can drop off a shield filled out ballot signed ballot without waiting in line you just go in and you drop it off into the proper place\nYes that's

running for office okay\nI was vetting the candidate I was trying to figure out where some of the other people that I admire that might get to know candidates better might sit or say\nAre you trying to tell me I was supposed to completely discard good people like Mike Huckabee like Rick Santorum like Ben Carson like Ted Cruz like Rand Paul suicide automatically oh and there are plenty others we had a very talented group\nOf men and women running for office each and all and there are different ways\nI mean they all added something they all had something that was that was valuable\nAs you know
