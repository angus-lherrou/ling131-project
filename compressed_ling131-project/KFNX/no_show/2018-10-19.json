Gary on W. N. T. W. in Virginia Line to what does this mean seven eleven\nAnd you hope are right this time last on all of their program I told you Donald Trump you got an expert in that state\nSo let's start with that but let's go into your eleventh thing\nNumber one there's two ways to look at number eleven number one that way they we use the number two the way it pops up now let's go to the first\nNine eleven happened the love at first plane hit the world trade Centers for nine eleven happened two hundred and fifty fourth day of the year two five forty was eleven the twin towers looked like an ... number eleventh standing side by side they both have a hundred and ten stories Oklahoma City happened for Nineteen Nineteen Ninety five\nFor one nine one nine Ninety five after the thirty eight are innate adds up to eleven first bomb went off at nine oh two ... and then executed Timothy McVeigh for on the eleventh\nSo basically what is going on here because obviously that's not a coincidence\n[laughter] yeah I can understand that the numbers have five racial energy that people who are in power are very aware of very aware of this now if you think I'm lying ask yourself why World War one and then at eleven eleven at exactly eleven o'clock it in South by a shock to tend to be five they waited till eleven\nOr hold on show what seven cycles of eleven plus two of my last book shutting number Lebanon the New York times list your mind mean for me\nIs that what it means to my mind is what it is and basically what it is is that you were having an emotional impact on people with a lot\nThat's what it basically breaks down to you have to understand that when average you see the number eleven whether it be or whether Charlottesville when they made sure that event happening on the eleventh or they have this like the figures\nOr it doesn't matter where you go with the the number eleven is going to touch people emotionally I'll give you an example of how this works um about a line\nLet me interject for a minute my friend burning ... who was a promise\nShut Jesse says Dr ... the average the number eleven is considered a master number is the most powerful neurological vibration remember you spend vibration he said simply state of the double one is the number of awakening when it shows up at the notes that a catalytic ...\nMean for me well it's not what it means to my mind is what it is and basically what it is is that you were having an emotional impact on people with a lot\nThat's what it basically breaks down to you have to understand that when average you see the number eleven whether it's the weather Charlottesville when they made sure that event happening on eleven or they have to say the figures\nOr it doesn't matter where you go with is the number eleven is going to touch people emotionally I'll give you an example how this works um about a line\nLet me interject for a minute my friend Vernon ... who was a promise\nSaid this he said Dr Savage the number eleven is considered a master number is the most powerful neurological vibration remember you said vibration\nHe said simply state of the double one is the number of awakening when it shows up at the notes that the catalytic the message is being relayed which will serve to inspire eliminate motivate\nAdditionally seven is a number of wisdom knowledge in in a reflection therefore seven cycles of eleven only magnifies that concept of awareness which sets in motion a change of or a breakthrough for you my best learning what do you think about that\nWell I I Would agree with a lot of that and the way you can show again the way you verify this if you look at the way they do not want average everyday people do what they do their store called seven eleven all around the world after Savage so obviously those two numbers go very well together\nThat's generic that's a generic statement what does it mean with regard to my my numbers eleven coming up all the time\nNot generic at all because the only way to verify this stuff actually work it's a look at the people at the top of the game and see how they're actually doing things\nSo yes they're doing things under eleven energy but the what your friend told you was only the positive side there's negative side says number eleven to\nThat's why al ... was formed on August eleventh that's why it hit New York on nine eleven that's why they hit Madrid, Spain for eleven that's why I had moved from India after eleven so there's two sides of the coin Savage hanging energy\nSo what are you saying\nWhat I'm saying is that if you are touching people's alive with your words you had a gift for writing and that's exactly why your folks are reaching number eleven it's not like New York times and manipulate and lift up the number that's coming out because you're having the most emotional info\nWait a minute the book before Trump's before God said the reason was number one on the New York times list that's another one on one than the Lebanon eleven so waiting for instance average first of all I predict stunning results for the podcast venture he says you'll get more or less this from other age groups\nThat

dramatically you may be significantly overpaying open enrollment is now and it's the best time to maximize your savings\nWhat does that mean disadvantage tell me what does it mean\n... if it means that they don't have as many resources that parents are not as educated\nAlso in other words a kid who comes from a family where the parents kill themselves to be educated and to keep the kid in school they should be punished now\nNo I'm saying this is\nWhat you are you saying yes you're saying automatically because if a kid comes from a household where let's say there's no father which by the way it's not even a racial thing anymore let's say there's no father at home it's a single parent and let's say a there he's poor and he lives in a terrible neighborhood\nHow do you explain all of the poor whites who came out of tremendous poverty\nAnd yet excelled in school how do you explain that\nNo I I I think the third thing that happened afterwards I realize that I'm fairly\nYou know that there was a time at Harvard that Jews were not permitted into Harvard the you know that\nThis was something that at\nSome level let me just explain that I've studied this in great detail\nThat was a time the Jews were prohibited from entering harm or did you know that\nI flew into that yet\nAnd yet some kids will let him because there was so brilliant their scores were so high there was a genius was they finally let them in\nOkay now we've turned around where you're at the stupidity or the higher your chances of getting in now\nYou know my friends stop with the words like homelessness to me to me homelessness has no meaning that's a left wing phrase to make you feel guilty and the other word is disadvantaged\nWhat do you think every person in this country was white has an advantage you believe in white privilege\nNo ... that's why this would help poor white kids from Appalachia and ... you know in other words if you're thinking you're increasing the way that you could for their relative uh children in school with they grow up and\nYou're making a good point but how ... that\nI think it's fair\nNo that's like saying being a big fish in a little pond as opposed to being a small fish in a big pawn exactly right so you're saying take the big fish from the small pond\nAnd then when that kid who thinks these great from Appalachian because he got straight days in a high school of a underperforming or a poor performing kids winds up an elite college so called they're on those ... such things anymore unless they're in the hard science as the rest is all trash\nUnless you're a hard science has no such thing as an institution that's better than the other\nAll of the others mishmash of direct\nIn plain English but let's say you take that kid who was number one in Appalachian high school and you put him into a so called Ivy League school and then he ... he faces kids who've been studying since they're one year old\nHell hell hole\nIf you're making a good point but how fair is that\nI think it's fair\nThough that's like saying being a big fish it a little pond as opposed to being a small fish in a big pond exactly right so you're saying take the big fish from the small pond\nAnd then when that kid who thinks he's great from Appalachia because he got straight days in a high school of a underperforming or a poor performing kids winds up and leave college so called they're on those ... such things anymore unless they're in the hard science as the rest is all trash\nUnless you're the hard science has no such thing as an institution that's better than the other\nAll of the others mishmash of direct\nIn plain English but let's say you take that kid who was number one in Appalachian high school and you put them into a so called Ivy League school and then he ... he faces kids who've been studying since they're one year old\nHell hell hole improving yourself at a young age rather than trying to get social justice for his forty years old and ... and he doesn't\nYou're assuming you will is you're making an assumption that because you let him into that elite school is going to become a fair minded person\nI've seen the opposite I think that people were given an unfair advantage to become worse because then they expected their whole life so then he gets out of a Princeton and Harvard or Yale or whatever and then when he goes for a job then he goes into the corporate world and then what does he demand you hire me or elsewhere I'll show you\nKnow no one can\nCan you ask anybody in the corporate world what they have to put up with with kids would come out of the schools who use the very same tactics they used to get into the schools in the corporation they will sue ya what the drop of a hat everybody knows this\nThe thing is people listening to and saying how dare even say it I Know what goes on in this country what should I hide what's real\n\nWell we disagree on this one\nI say no don't get any won a special advantage either it's equal to everyone or it's not equal at all is that simple you know there's no such thing\nAs a reverse racism\nThose words don't have any meaning either it's racism or isn't racism so if your school to Asians are whites because they're doing too well that's racism\nAnd you know I thank God the Asians finally sued this has been going on since Nineteen Seventy eight\nBut no one who's ... listen to the show they're too busy working\nA four and five forty seven to eight to now before I take a break\nI Can't wait for the podcast come January\nCan I tell you a bit about it we had a big part cast meeting this morning of a team of sixteen people it's so it's going to be amazing here's how it's going to work the show is going to be live this first hour on the stations that carry me\nNow some stations will not carry me not because the ratings are and I am and Norman's ratings\nBut because we're going to be going into the cycle of the election and liberals are running some of these stations they're taking me off the air that's the way it is I don't care what they tell you that's what's happening okay but the rest of your we'll get we'll hear the radio show for an hour and then anybody can hear\nThe podcast for free there's no charge for it anywhere in the world at any time\nAnd I expected it will be one of the largest broadcaster in the world and so all predictors indicate that\nIt will become one of the most important part cash on the planet\nAnd if you don't believe me wait until January you wait and see what's going to happen\nSo one way or the other the gatekeepers are going to go whether it's at Harvard or on the radio business\nIt's that simple they can try all they want they can destroy any stationed in the world and get away with it but you know what if you have the truth the truth is going to set your free\nKB T clean line seven go ahead please\nYes Hi good afternoon Dr Savage long time listener first time there um I just wanted to call and let the federal deficit for it but then after it's quieter on time going back to the early nineties when I applied to go go\nCast for free there's no charge for it anywhere in the world at any

please\nYes Hi good afternoon Dr Savage long time listener first time last year um I just wanted to call and say hey we left the social justice lawyers but then after is quite a long time going back to the early nineties when I applied\nTo go to the medical school I was cold and ... by a Chicago medical medical school located in the Chicago area that I call it didn't fit the demographic at the time uh and I was I was five eight ...\nI'm I was what I I think part of the reason why I'm so attracted here and listen to your compulsively is because\nI like I like to pulse of listeners that's a good that's actually made my day the more the more compulsive listened as I have the better\nAs a well rounded individual as I you know a chemistry nature I majored in a second nature and a foreign language I stayed on an extra\n[laughter] why it was a woman chemistry major probably was near near straight A's and they said you don't meet the demographics\nI cannot make their demographic and it was clear why demographic they were talking about and it\nWell I Wonder what I Wonder what Obama's SAT scores were to get into Harvard does anyone know\nI Know there was an FBI investigation of Kavanaugh's junior high school records is a great school records as nursery school records but to this day we don't know if Obama even took a course and passed them\nI'm sure they don't feel like\nI'm waiting I Will say that she got straight days in in in ... be asking the public he was pretty good at throwing the wind\nYeah what did you what did you do with your life ... after your rejected by this medical school because she went to white\nEye I ended I ended up going to different medical school in the Midwest and ... from my medical school class\nOr as more of a show it's a success story in a way\nIt yes yeah yes but it left you when the moon in your stomach and your heart didn't it\nBut yeah you know your chest and say I work and work and work and I see people and if I start just on the admission process to professional school whether that law or medical school it continues on and when you go to apply for residency\nAre you kidding of you've taken a look in the in the hospitals when you go and what it looks like now like a third world nation\nYes it does and I\nAnd I roll over and I don't know whether it's Obama Osama bin Laden or a savior coming to the treatment\n[laughter] yes and not to mention the fact that there\nAre now we don't have a suspicion ah basically with an association with hospitals anymore as independents physicians are all\nGrown up here you are telling

cook I can taste the difference between the food cooked in one frying pan and another I usually use non skip for example nuns get bans I use I the reason the convenience whenever last night I pulled out I'm a little weird with stuff I had a frying pan about two years ago I never use the none none of non scared\nI like to say things they're gonna find things I bought that will never used in my life I don't know why buy them if I'm not using them\nI buy like a beautiful frying pan so I don't have the nuns skin\nSo I hooked on that last night the food taste different tasted better\nYou know I didn't taste I don't know what I think the skins the nuns skin plastics are breaking off into our food there's no question about it no matter what they tell you it's like bottled water I got to tell you this I was drinking\nI should mention that brand let's say a plastic bottled water for years because I didn't want the fluoride and I didn't want some of the other stuff in the in the tap water right\nAnd you know you get used to it but you don't realize you're drinking plastic so my son says no no you can only drink bottled water from bottles he sends me cases of and I love him he loves me so much I'll tell you the truth I Can't go back to the plastic Warner anymore the minute I put it through our mouth tastes plastic and it's not psychological I could take the plastic and the water\nDoes it makes sense they put the water in a bottle seven thousand miles away it's just to the bottom of a ship\nThe plastic breaks down in the hold of the shift that in the warehouse then in the truck\nOf course you're going to take plastic if you've got to find so I mean I guess the different things like the frying pan\nSo out of the frying pan into the fire so to speak\nSo it's not a political statement on making it all just like I'm not blaming anyone say the communists did it a Bernie Sanders didn't do it to me the pope did make the frying pan just thought about that are just talking on the level of like a cooking\nI could do a whole park is I'm cooking someday\nYou won't believe what I made last night I\nKnow you don't want to hear something that I see doing this again\nIt was so good I took two portions I intended to eat ... one portion\nAnd then I you know what is the weather change so I got out a bottle of red wine I had in the closet for many years at twenty eleventh hit and they'll oh I Can't touch that stuff red wine in the summer I had a smashing migraine the minute it gets cold and it gets to getting cold out here now hot days cold nights every or October the same yeah global warming every October like clockwork\nLike clockwork burning hot days and cold nights nothing changed I live near the water as it got up one millimeter and all the years I've lived next to it but do ask some schmuck at Harvard of global warming the sea levels are rising they never been down to the see\nThe former mayor of San Francisco never rode on the bay\nBut

communist light country\nUm or they were lightning the restrictions on property ownership for their people yes economic growth yes there is a growing because they produce items and do they have a mandatory pay scales and restrictions yes but so do we\nDo we they're producing something we're giving them money 'cause we're getting products\nEveryone says oh what are you pro China an anti ... no no no I'm against anybody that's using our money using our goodwill misusing our military power and I have no problem with the country I don't have to agree with every inch of their policies\nTo want to have an open free trade system with them that that's different because I Believe once people are exposed to liberty once people are exposed to prosperity and property rights they will demand that\nI recognize what is the enlightenment and where are the enlightenment from from Europe\nIt's from it's the concept of that lack articulate it so well it's what the foundation of our country I Want that to spread not through military force and I think when you expose the country to prosperity it will spread\nAnd I think you can trace back where China started and where it is today and see that that that our trade with China and other countries by the way we only make up Seventeen percent of Chinese trade\nAll the nonsense out there like they only exist for us know when it when it's a big piece Seventeen percent they're going to do what they do regardless of our tariff policy\nThe point is do you believe in freedom for the citizen or do you just want to mandate it through certain corrupt ... countries and none more represents a corrupt ... and Saudi Arabia but let's go to the phone lines David thank you\nThey will demand it I recognize what is the enlightenment and where's the enlightenment from from Europe it's from it's the concept of a lack articulated so well it's what the foundation of our country and I want that to spread not through military force and I think when you expose a country to prosperity it will spread and\nI think you can track back where China started and where it is today and see that that that our trade with China and other countries by the way

regardless of our tariff policy\nThe point is do you believe in freedom for the citizen or do you just want to mandate it through certain corrupt ... countries and none more represents a corrupt ... and Saudi Arabia but let's go to the phone lines David thank you so much for calling the Joe Walsh show how are you\nGood good you know I wanted to go beyond just term limits and just scream it this way let me just say real quickly go have a six term ... or ... for congressman return for senators plus if you're married a lobbyist\nAnd you are the numbers on your calls at the end of your term for you after you are dumber Congress and I live in Washington and at her with her thirty mile race and you set up your lobbyist for twenty year\nWell here's here's here's where you and I agree David to me the only restrictions in this country should be on politicians and the thing about when you're when you are a merry a lobbyist that's a little different than what Dick Durbin did which was he was married and then his wife became a lobbyist and you know you wouldn't believe\nWhat the batting averages of her clients who hire her to get something done and the fact that gets done what do you think it is\n'cause I'll tell you what it's better than by cops batting average that's for sure\nSo and then the idea about term limits of course there should be term limits but why would they term limit themselves to pay package cut their hands off\nCourse they don't why would they turn limit themselves when they have the best job in the whole world they literally do do less than zero have targeted special interest that pay them for their benefit then at the end of it you know what they get called honorable and the pension\nAnd they could do whatever they want why would you leave that\nWhy would you leave them so the different as we need to change that we need to change it all limitations in this country shouldn't be on you and me and what insurance policy you want the silver platinum and they shouldn't be announced it should be on them\nAnd some of these things need to start with the money because you know what the article in the Drudge Report was today on the on the top article Democrats raise a billion dollars ... billion one billion dollars\nI mean I Know it's not conservative anymore it's not a a fundamental principle of Republicanism to want to limit the money to the politician\nBut I Do let me say right now the absolute only limitation in this country should be on the politician because the idea that we let Mitch McConnell make forty four ... four Seventy four million dollars and his father in law become the greatest shipping mogul in China and we pretend these on my team\nIt's crazy to me crazy\nAnd it doesn't stop David I don't recognize the thank you so much\nA kid do me a favor give me a Andy blind to Andy thank you so much for calling the Joe Walsh program I appreciate it\nA shot are you doing good buddy [noise] um I I wanted to figure out about ... agreement is\nOh I Love it stealing a write up opening notorious feel it I Love it man\nThe the local municipality\nI I just moved out of a little out award Charlotte cornfields and sure this big developer wanted to move in or only\nYeah we're in there and have to be relieved of the taxes you pay\nTwenty three years and and\nThree dollars ... it's all about\nWell in China and we pretend these on my team that's crazy to me crazy and it doesn't stop David I don't recognize the thank you so much a kid do me a favor give me a Andy blind to Andy thank you so much for calling the Joe Walsh program I appreciate it\nA shot or you don't go by [noise]\nUm I I wanted to figure out about ... agreement is\nOh I Love it stealing a write up opening notorious feel and I love it\nMan the the local municipality I I just moved out to a law out award Charlotte cornfields and sure this big developer wanted to move in or only\nYeah we're gonna have to be relieved of the taxes you pay\nTwenty three years and and\nTwenty three dollars ... it's a lot\nOf the ... getting bigger because every day or and more and more accidents on interstate eighty mainly right where all these trucks are going off and on the interstate to go through this thing or moral federal court\nAnd oh it's going to be all these hundreds of millions of billion dollars\nHere's the thing and here's what you gotta know Chicago Illinois in particular the entire state for the you know that's what I mean Chicago's you been doing this for decades Illinois is not doing it because the reality is they can't get economic growth without giving the money to do\nSo in other words they're giving them twenty three years\nOf no property taxes now what's killing the average Illinois and his property taxes are ... so you get this company in and we listen promise I promise we won't make you pay those taxes for twenty three years not only that we're going to give you sweet percentage deals on the loan you need\nNot only that we're going to make sure that there's no real restrictions in variances in different things other people have to do it because we are going to make sure you come here because we want you to create jobs\nBut when you do the math what you eat that Illinois has subsidize any pretend growth there is no real growth there is only the illusion the the a Potemkin growth that Illinois pretended has because of its fail you failed policies\nPeople who can do and they leave\nNo other people are tethered here through love and affection and family obligations and they can't leave\nBut how does Illinois it proceed and and fake the the the the pretend the illusion that it's a it's a state that's running okay they give money to targeted industries in people that's why if you're an independent taxpayer you want to get your taxes lowered the easy call the right clothes\nCall up the right call go to a bird go to Mike Madigan hire their law firm and you can get it done and that's the thing to remember is that failed socialism is the most corrupt of all governments because it what it does is it takes those politicians and it makes them guides and that's why they sell it\nWhen you say you can't beat it all these politicians can't recognize this oh no no no no they recognize it and they like it\nThey recognize it and they want to put mustard on it they love it because it makes them gods and it makes you slaves that's why if you read one book in your life make it the road to serfdom by Hajek because what he warned about Seventy five years ago it was what you wake up to in the morning\nHe ... he warns you do not ... with socialism for it is a cancer that metastasize is of which no host can survive none not the Soviet Union that Venezuela not Chicago 'cause that's the other thing recognized we pretend there's an election going on\nReally is there an electric they're Seventeen version\nOf all governments because it what it does is it takes those politicians and it makes them God and that's why they sell it when you say you can't beat it all these politicians can't recognize this oh no no no no they recognize it and they like it\nThey recognize it and they want to put much there that it they love it because it makes them gods and it makes you sleep that's why if you read one book and you're like make it the road to serfdom by higher because what he warned about Seventy five years ago it was what you wake up to in the morning\nHe ... he warns you do not ... with socialism for it is a cancer that metastasize is of which no host can survive none that the Soviet

community and we saw all of the things exploding the cost of schools the cost of healthcare but one of the things I recognized as a young kid\nIs well that shouldn't exist anyway\nSo I don't want to use immigration as an excuse to protect American failed socialism\nThere shouldn't be public school I'm Sorry kidding [laughter] I Know a lot of people out there benefit but it shouldn't exist your

shouldn't pay for your health care we should pay for your kid's school\nAnd I would just interject by saying it specially\nThese days you know going back to what you're saying earlier about socialism being taught where do you think these kids are getting these ideas are getting hot and like that you know capitalism is right there it's just a recent article coming out up I'm teen vogue magazine

immigration as an excuse to protect American failed socialism\nThere shouldn't be public school I'm Sorry kid [laughter] I Know a lot of people out there but if it but it shouldn't exist your neighbor

college admissions consultant who serves primarily Asian Americans but also a white Americans\nAre my first point is that basically white students actually set the standard for admissions at all the schools from Harvard to Berkeley\nAh there's actually an admissions formula where points are assigned for your grades your test scores and your accomplishments or what happens is that a Asian Americans when they look cute though that a score to for admission are penalized during the process actually at points subtracting from their overall score\nFor being for being too smart correct\nOr so that was there and sort of reverse IQ in other words Harvard or using a reverse IQ to admit people dumber you are the better off you are\nHow well you have to understand is that true purpose of affirmative action and these quotas they're the true purpose is to make sure that a white liberals maintain at at least a plurality but ideally a majority on campus because if they don't have to have the numbers\nThen we will reached a tipping point where white people no longer want to go to school for like Harvard and the old up like Cal Tech in Berkeley were basically there are dominated by Asians and not because Asians um\nHave necessarily a ... of everything but white liberals no longer want to go there because they don't feel like they're in the majority anymore\nSo what are you actually saying there is there are there isn't discrimination against Asians\nThere is discrimination against their agents for is that what I'm trying to say that Asians actually have the highest benchmark the highest standard of all the races followed by white there the standard basically events mark\nAnd blacks Hispanics Native Americans actually at points added during the process of admissions to their formula\nRight well that's what came out during that look the trial now in in Cambridge the Asian American suit Harvard and found out that they are being top bloated ... against them their scores have to be higher to even be considered\nA higher and higher than any of the ... that's the that's the main point and the purpose\nThere are dominated by Asians and not because Asians um have necessarily are the best of everything but white liberals no longer want to go there because they don't feel like they're in the majority anymore\nSo what are you actually saying there is there are there isn't discrimination against Asians\nThere is discrimination against their transfers that when I'm trying to say that Asians actually have the highest benchmark the highest standard of all the races followed by white there the standard basically the benchmark and blacks Hispanics Native Americans actually at points added during the process of admissions to their formula\nRight well that's what came out during that look the trial now in in Cambridge the Asian American suit Harvard and found out that they are being top bloated ... against them their scores have to be higher to even be considered\nA higher and higher than any of the race that's the that's the main point and the purpose behind that again is not for diversity but to make sure that white liberal do not fall into the minority because then they would reached that tipping point right just like we have white flight in the cities and yes white flight here in northern California\nWhite people no long no longer want to live in neighborhoods that are what predominately Asian\nSaying with the colleges so Harvard and Yale\nDamage your white people don't want to live in Asia neighborhoods does that affect\nEver have you ever seen neighborhoods in Fremont Cupertino San Francisco where all the white people go where the public school\nHow wait wait a minute how come Nancy Pelosi and fled yet\nBecause first of all she's a grandmother\nAnd second of all her kids if they go to school for grandkids I should say we'll go to private white high schools they won't know\nIn other words it doesn't apply to our\nCorrect\nSo what what do you think needs to be done to make things fair for everyone\nWill obviously the mission formula has to be a thon apply equally for all races you can't have a penalty for being Asian and a a points just for being black or Hispanic Native American the way it is today and we have to let\nThe ... the urine and missions consultant so let's look at Harvard for example or yellow printed in the same thing applies to all of these schools have subjects that are extremely difficult that you can't fake\nWhether it be astrophysics for organic chemistry or things like that are you telling me that the kids who admitted with these rigs scores are able to compete in those classes\nHit the nail on the head they don't major in physics or electrical engineering\nOh so what do

not a refugee anymore you have no right to enter the United states and I was really just started working at all\nWell and and aren't you glad that the Trump decided uh because it's a you know he's actually going by the laws that are already on the books but as I understand it it was the Obama administration that said oh when it comes to persecution we're going to include economics and gangs and

problems together are based on the numbers I've been able to\nFind about five or six thousand of those Seventy two thousand died because of abuse of\nA pharmaceutical drugs the kind that come from a legitimate companies are and the other Ninety percent die because of street drugs\nLike heroin that comes across our borders and there is a real connection to the borders and I thought we'd get Derrick molds on who's a former special agent in charge us a seat of the United States Department of justice drug Enforcement Administration in the special operations division and he's involved in a documentary called not in vain\nA dark welcome to the program\nHey how are you great to be on the program\nI I'm doing great but I you know I don't happen to have a heroin addiction and frankly I haven't had anybody in my family\nAt least that I'm aware of who's had that but I I Know of some you know for some folks I'm acquainted with who've lost kids they've lost family members because of addiction to heroin an addiction to pharmaceutical drugs\nAre I Want you to tell my audience you know before they go see not in vain this new documentary about this connection because for a long time I've emphasized that your former agency the da says it about Ninety percent of that heroine comes across the border from Mexico so part of the solution seems pretty self evident doesn't it\nYeah no exactly and so the public needs to know first of all we have not only a public health crisis but we have a national security emergency because these Mexican cartels\nThat adopted poison all over the country is what's killing people yes you are right now there's a low percentage of pharmaceutical pills that are actually killing Americans right now that that\nYou know for some folks on the queen did with who've lost kids they've lost family members because of addiction to heroin addiction to pharmaceutical drugs\nAre I Want you to tell my audience you know before they go see not invading his new documentary about this connection because for a long time I've emphasized that your former agency the da says about Ninety percent of that heroine comes across the border from Mexico so part of the solution seems pretty self evident doesn't it\nYeah no exactly and so the public needs to know first of all we have not only a public health crisis but we have a national security emergency because these Mexican cartels\nBetter dumping toys in all over the country is what's killing people yes you're right\nThere's a low percentage of pharmaceutical pills that are actually killing Americans right now the vast majority is being killed from the mix to solve this potent center and all of a synthetic drug coming right from China and the labs in China and then mixing it with everything\nAnd large the thing is is that it's not just somebody that's addicted on heroin it's a college kid that things taken the Arab world pill is going to keep 'em alert in this in the class in class and stay focused but what they don't realize is the pills\nAre mixed with pencil and by the way for the view is one kilogram of fencing all can kill about five hundred thousand adults because it only takes two grain to milligrams\nOf ... to kill an adult but we have a we have a much larger issue laws because you know another thing is these terrorist groups like Hezbollah\nThey're tapping into the criminal networks to their funding and their resources we had a case a couple of years ago when I'm On June was moving to a hundred million dollars a month to support Hezbollah and he was moving the proceeds furloughs that is a\nCartel here so we have a very serious problem and the American public just doesn't understand it can impact anyone of us if you look at not in vain Marron Greg who's Twenty years old she was a\nBeautiful young girl who had very much you know love their family passion polite typical kid you know playing sports he was a capital of the golf team and lots of friends and then her brother finds it that\nBecause she got a ticket and then she went out on to you know by some of this stuff and it's it's mixed with whatever was in the particular you know\nPackage you she she bought but the point is is they don't know what that Getty\nAnd that's the issue Mexican cartels do not have you know train cameras that are actually caring about quality control they care about making money and grow in their business and the price and the scary part Lars is the fact that China\nIs developing all these chemical compounds and dumping it on our country and China is a communist country so you know what better way to disrupt the Americans by you know then by killing their their their children and bike you know destroying their communities and so we have multiple facets of this problem\nThere Scott I'm Talking to dirt mall choose a former special agent in charge of the dia de da de ... take the kind of efforts that that this country does to try to interdict

export and these cameras that they hire their their very clever because they know what the controlled substances are so they know the molecular formulas and they change a little bit of the formula so it's not even like technically illegal and so\nFacets of this ...

cameras that they hire their their very clever because they know what the controlled substances are so they know the molecular formulas and they change a little bit of the formula so it's not even like technically illegal and\nSo the U.S government the department of justice the DEA has had several meetings recently with China to try to get them to understand\nThat this may not be illegal but it's destroying lives all over America so there has been some increase cooperation but lost honestly it's really not it's nothing to brag about I mean the pope the politics\nThe politicians will make like everything's moving down to write at but it's a bunch of BS to be honest with you from my standpoint I mean they're not aggressive enough with them it is China\nIt's a very complex situation I don't plan to be a Chinese experts but we do know and you're listening and snow that China's a really really big national security threat to our country and this is just another piece of it you know they're the hacking of computers they're stealing our identities they're going after a financial\nGrades and I lecture grades so you know dumping poison in our country\nIs just a side thing but one note I Want to tell you you know when we went after these Afghan heroin traffic is for a long time we actually had a few of them say\nSelling heroin to the west is like a jihad against the west are making millions of dollars and we're killing Americans so this is the same concept in my opinion on that this is partially all what's going on depending on you know who in China is actually sending at all well\nMay be good about what they accomplish if they can manufacture the drugs cheaply and the trench Chinese government turned a blind eye to it and allows it to happen there not only damaged the United states they have is incur tremendous human costs as well as financial cause\nAnd all that cash from producing this stuff flows back into China one way or the other which is good for trying to because ... and the soup financially so they they get to ... to hurt their biggest competitor the military as well as economic competitor and they get some of our cache of the same time it's a win win and I\nI call it a two for one special laws I mean they win every which way and and by the way the Mexican cartels are just in it for the money and they're making billions of dollars as you know and they're right on our border and\nThere's so many illegal here in America right now involved with the cartels different aspects of the cartels distribution a you know whether it's the ... elections the

communist light country\nUm or they were ... lightening the restrictions on property ownership for their people yes\nEconomic growth yes there are growing because they produce\nItems and do they have a mandatory pay scales and restrictions yes but so do we ... we they're producing something we're giving them money 'cause we're getting products everyone says oh you're pro China on it they said no no no I'm against anybody that's using our money using our goodwill\nMisusing our military power\nAnd I have no problem with the country I don't have to agree with every inch of their policies\nTo want to have an open free trade system with them that that's different because I Believe once people are exposed to liberty once people are exposed to prosperity and property rights they will demand that I recognize what is the enlightenment and where the enlightenment from from Europe\nIt's from it's the concept of that lack articulate it so well it's what the foundation of our country and I want that to spread not through military force\nAnd I think when you expose a country to prosperity it will spread and I think you can track back where China started and where it is today and see that that that our trade with China and other countries by the way we only make up Seventeen percent of Chinese trade all but not out there like they only exist for us\nKnow when it when it's a big piece but Seventeen percent they're going to do what they do regardless of our tariff policy\nThe point is do you believe in freedom for the citizen or you just want to mandate it through certain corrupt cobalt countries and none more represents a corrupt ... and Saudi Arabia but let's go to the phone lines David thank you so much for calling the Joe Walsh show how are you\nGood good you know I wanted to go beyond just term limits just scream it this way let me just say real quickly go have a six term ... for for congressman return or senators was if you marry a lobbyist and you are the numbers on your post at the end of your time\nAnd I think you can trace back where China started and where it is today and see that that that our trade with China and other countries by the way we only make up the Seventeen percent of Chinese trade all the nonsense out there like they only exist for us know when it when it's a big piece Seventeen percent they're going to do what they do regardless of our tariff policy\nThe point is do you believe in freedom for the citizen or you just want to mandate it through certain corrupt cabal countries and none more represents a corrupt ... and Saudi Arabia but let's go to the phone lines David thank you so much for calling the Joe Walsh show how are you\nGood good you know I wanted to go beyond just term limits and just the frame it this way let me just say real quickly go ahead of six terms ... for for congressman return or senators wash\nIf you're married a lobbyist than you are the numbers on your post at the end of your time plus you can I ask you are dumber Congress you cannot live in Washington sent out her with her thirty mile race and set up your lobbyist for twenty year\nHere on the Internet ears were you and I agree David to me the only restrictions in this country should be on politicians and the thing about when you're when you a merry a lobbyist that's a little different than what the ticks urban did which is he was married and then his wife became a lobbyist and you know you wouldn't believe\nWith the batting averages of her clients who hire her to get something done and the fact that gets done what do you think it is because I'll tell you what it's better than Ty Cobb batting average that's for sure so and then the idea about term limits of course there should be term limits but why would they term limit themselves\nTo pick package cut their hands off course they don't do what they term limit themselves when they have the best job in the whole world\nThey literally do do blacks in zero have targeted special interest that pay them\nFor their benefit then at the end of it you know what they get called honorable and the pension and they could do whatever they want why would you leave that why would you leave that so the difference is we need to change that we need to change it all limitations in this country shouldn't be on you and me and what insurance policy want the silver planting them\nAnd they shouldn't be announced it should be on them and some of these things need to start with the money because you know what the article in the Drudge Report was put in as a top article Democrats raise a billion dollars ... billion one billion dollars I mean I Know it's not\nConservative anymore it's not a a fundamental principle of Republicanism to want to limit the money to the politician but I Do let me say right now the absolute only limitation in this country should be on the politician because the idea that we like Mitch McConnell make forty four fifty four Seventy four million dollars\nAnd his father in law become the greatest shipping mogul in China and we pretend these on my team that's crazy to me crazy and it doesn't stop David recognize a thank you so much\nA kid do me a favor give me a handy line to Andy thank you so much for calling the Joe Walsh program I appreciate it\nHey Sean how you doing good buddy hey um I I wanted to figure out about fifth agreements\nLovett stealing or right up opening notorious feel and I love it\nMan I think the local municipality I I just moved out of a little town ... garlic cornfields and sure this big developer wanting to move in orange point\nYeah we're hearing you could be relieved of the taxes you pay\nTwenty three years and and\nTwenty three here is known to exist it's on\nNow the ... getting bigger because every day or hearing more and more accidents on interstate eighty mainly right where all these trucks are going off and on the interstate to go to the existing in our model that our point\nUm\nUm I I Want her to figure out about ... agreement\nLovett stealing or right up opening notorious feel it I Love it\nMan I think the local municipality I I just moved out of a little town ... garlic cornfields and sure enough this big developer wanted to move in order to point\nYeah we're hearing seem to be relieved of the taxes you pay\nTwenty three years and and\nTwenty three dollars no Texas it's on\nNow that's the trouble getting bigger because every day or hearing more and more accidents on interstate eighty mainly right where all these trucks are following off and on the interstate to go through the existing in our moral butter on\n'em and oh it's going to be all these hundreds of millions of billion dollars\nThis and here's the thing and here's what you gotta know Chicago Illinois in particular the entire state for the you know that's what I mean Chicago's you've been doing this for decades Illinois is now doing it because the reality is they can't get economic growth without giving the money to do\nSo in other words they're giving them twenty three years of no property taxes now what's killing the average Illinois and his property taxes Africa access so you get this company in\nAnd we they lifted promise you I promise we won't make you pay those Texas for twenty three years not only that we're going to give you sweet percentage deals on the loans you need\nNot only that we're going to make sure that there's no real restriction variants isn't the first things other people have to do because we're going to make sure you come here\nBecause we want you to create jobs but when you do the math what you saw that Illinois has subsidize any pretend growth there is no real growth there is only the illusion\nThe the a Potemkin growth that Illinois pretended has because of its fail you failed policies people who can do and they leave the other people are tethered here through love and affection and family obligations and they can't leave\nBut how does Illinois it proceed and and fake the the the the pretend the illusion that it's a it's a state that's running okay they give money to targeted industries in people that's why if you're an independent taxpayer you want to get your taxes lowered the easy call the right call\nCall up the right to go to a bird go to Mike mad to get hired their law firm and you can get it done and that's the thing to remember is that failed socialism is the most corrupt of all governments because it what it does is it takes those politicians and it makes them guides\nAnd that's why they sell it when you say you can't beat it all these politicians can't recognize this\nOh no no no no they recognize it and they like it they recognize it and they want to put mustard on it they love it because it makes them gods and it makes you slaves that's why if you read one book and you're like make it the road to serfdom by Hajek\nBecause what he warned about Seventy five years ago it was what you wake up to in the morning\nHe ... he warns you\nDo not clued with socialism for it is a cancer that metastasize as of which no host can survive none not the Soviet Union that Venezuela not Chicago because that's the other thing recognized we pretend there's an election going on oh really is there an elect their Seventeen version for the same freak\nSeventeen versions of the same nonsense and then spread it out to the state you got seven foot stupid Laurel and hardy of failure\nYou got router and Pritzker ooh what's the big difference\nAnd I are the ones who got a wife that's very involved the other one's seems like she doesn't say much I'll go with the quiet wife because it's\nStan gods and it makes you slates that's why if you read one book and you're like make it the road to serfdom by Hajek because what he warned about Seventy five years ago it was what you wake up to in the morning\nHe ... he warns you\nDo not ... with socialism for it is a cancer that metastasize as of which no host can survive none that the Soviet Union that Venezuela not Chicago 'cause that's the other thing recognize that we pretend there's an election going on over there in LA there's Seventeen version of the same freak\nSeventeen versions of the same nonsense and then spread it out to the state you got seven for stupid Laurel and hardy failure\nYou got router and Pritzker whoa what's the big difference\nAnd I the one's got a wife that's very involved the other one seemed like she doesn't say much I'll go with the quiet wife\nBecause it's the same policies that same bend inspired borrow that same nonsense not accountability and it's the same collusion and corruption because if you're sick a Democrat lobbyists that has to go take a look Nancy Kenny is five foot two or three hundred pounds of corruption all wrapped in a trench coat that's what you get\nBecause it is the most corrupt system you've ever seen because that's the only way it survives the fake success if kids tip

everything he's earning seasons now and you know opening to the economy are quite good it was the one thing now although already a third of those companies reporting earnings and said is costing money raises a concern is terrorists just last week you know\nFor BMW they said these Arabs are costing them literally hundreds of millions of dollars so as the president is literally celebrating and bragging about and all the money that is coming into treasury show that's our money or the tax dollars looking to celebrate if\nHe wouldn't admit it to you so he's a liar Peter Navarro is a lighter\nIt yeah and it's it's funny and you can colored hair of a tariff but it really is just the tax and he has been tremendous slogans about how you know it's terrible for working at the tax on China just have to go back to be a shot and you know inflation is now a rising at\nThe highest rate in six years I Believe that there\nAre a lot to do with that I mean the whole point of tears to raise the cost of goods that we buy and you know shouldn't have sworn it sounds so it's a terror can out there and in the in the in terms of economics but it just comes to why should you pay more for

inexpensive I grew up my mother raised me every penny choose to carry around a little red thing to make sure she wasn't embarrassed by not having the money or per se I ... I knew what it was like to have next to nothing and needed a bargain on things\nBut yet the beauty of our system of capitalism itself\nIs that it provides with you for you options and value\nAnd the son of a guns are determined\nTo not only take it away but to profit from your choices and pretend it's government six that's see that's the thing because Trump's tweet of tariffs money is flowing into the treasury that taxes paid by some of the people who can least afford the ...\nAnd Peter Navarro could not or really would not answer your question\nAnd it's a it's hot and you know we're already seeing it and and if people say oh come on now it's funny ... you only have you have to only battled Democrats because Democrats went on to say oh come on it's an extra one or two percent and you can afford that now it's been Republican\nRepublican come on it's just a little bit more you could afford that you're absolutely right it's those who can least afford it uh the extra taxes in

those who can least afford it uh the extra taxes and the weather is\nOr tried to pay for it and you know sure we're already seeing it in something like washing machines you know that was one of the earliest tariffs that the president could on an importer washing machines prices are up you know between Fifteen and twenty per se\nHow he's talking about ... four hundred five hundred dollar I you know\nSo I look I have money and that's a lot of money\nLet's do that Jesse Livermore and step back and take that one example that you just ... so the washing machine goes up well who who goes to laundromat put the poorest the people behind us around us so now when the laundry when the machine goes up what is the laundromat do\nIt raises its prices so your literally patch through in an increase to people who are struggling minute come in\nNot only that you may be preventing somebody who's poor\nFrom getting that new item now you force them into a laundromat so just that one single item what I hate about people who are at least people around us that are telling us don't worry this was a good policy they're ignoring the ramifications of these terrible we all know where this really dissent Nineteen Thirteen anymore we know what's gonna happen\nYeah yeah I mean the end and you don't need to go to back into history and Sean I mean just go back to two thousand to ... you know President Bush tribe is try to an import tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and what was what he found was that unemployment decrease unemployment\nSlow for a period of time but they didn't stop at all and in fact there was tremendous job\nLoss and all those other ancillary a at ... industries as you said in it but it it it comes down to any like any intervention into free people's lives it ends up hurting and making costs of getting the more expensive to keep out stay out keep a free people free and stop manipulating with what we buy and and where we shop\nAnd you know what's funny is you pick that example of what was Wilbur Ross doing during that time Wilbur Ross was the guy who had the aluminum had the steel he's the guy that was guaranteed profits through his connections to Bush right so there's a corporate ...\nThere is a diabolical thing nature to this this isn't patriotism to me this is a diabolical corporate ... this is where the true special interests love these policies it's Americans feel what's the first thing they did after Trump or is this there are employed by the terrorists they raise their prices\nIn fact they get afford to shoot commercials now for

Illinois was was one of the first towns where I'm at that time illegal aliens Mexicans in particular came\nThere was a small community of Mexicans and they were welcome there and we welcome them there for the most part and they came up one of the things that we saw happen was that all of our documents started to have to be printed\nIn Spanish and it was a tremendous cost to this little community and we saw all of the\nThings exploding the cost of schools the cost of health care but one of the things I recognized as a young kid\nIs well that shouldn't exist anyway so I don't want to use immigration as an excuse to protect American failed socialism there shouldn't be public school I'm Sorry kidding [laughter]\nI live in a community called ... ... in ... Illinois was was one of the first towns where I'm at that time illegal aliens Mexicans Baylor came there was a small community Mexican\nAnd they were welcome there and we welcome them there for the most part and they came but one of the things that we saw happen was that all of our documents started to have to be printed\nIn Spanish ... and it was a tremendous cost of this little community and we saw all of the\nThings exploding the cost of schools the cost of health care but one of the things I recognize that a young kid\nIs well that shouldn't exist anyway so I don't want to use immigration as an excuse to protect American failed socialism there shouldn't be public school\nI'm Sorry can I Know a lot of people out there are benefits but it shouldn't exist your neighbor shouldn't pay for your kid to go to school and if you believe in freedom and he believing liberty you would have rejected it at a premise because it's also hard to argue why your neighbor should we pay for your health care we should pay for your kid's school\nAnd I would just interject by saying especially\nThese days you know going back to what you're saying earlier about socialism being taught where do you think these kids are getting these ideas are getting tight like that you know capitalism is right there it's just a recent article coming out from teen vogue magazine talking about the end of world poverty you need to and capitalism yeah stuff is being taught\nIn school which is exactly you know in these teen magazines apparently now I'm so when if I ever have kids do I want to send them to a public school and they're just going to be indoctrinated with basically socialism nonsense\nSo let me tell you I Do have kids I have two teenagers ... my wife and I wish I'm a regular guy real estate broker type of food on the table I own a little cigarettes are but I Am a real estate but it was hard sometimes sometimes I'm leaning month we have never never taken our kids are put them in a public system of anything we pay that extra money you wonder if she'll complain about\nAn average into it when they went to grade school was like seven thousand a year and a lot of money yeah but you want to know something to public school waste twice that\nBecause they don't waste their money they waste our money it's always easier to spend somebody else's money than yourself\nIf you have kids I got news for you out there you have an obligation to that kid it's not your old neighbor who already raised escape Vietnam the kid but let's not use law the weapon to extort on 'em and that's the problem so when you argue about immigration do it on an intelligent level where you're not arguing to protect\nAmerican failed socialism you're arguing on principles and when you really dissect it you should be a principled\nAmerican my name is Shawn Johnson in federal law\n\n\nAre you ready to grow up the free ... program Congressman Joe ...

nutritional support\nAddressing that very challenging so someone someone stressed out you know we can't do anything about what is stressing you out you need to talk to somebody you need to bring some balance to life and I really mean that sincerely because stress is a killer but the toxic effect of it the feeling of it\nNutritional supplements like what we do with a hen fusion stress can help to support the negative feelings or effects of it and\nHelp to give you that balance and you know without the dating you know because a lot of times what people do when they have stress they just want to relax and fall asleep I just want to like sedate themselves and kind of just ...\nThat you know what imagine if you could have all the energy you want but not feel stressed out that's kind of the goal is to give you that daytime non sedative kind of balance and just awesome feeling and that's where him fusion stress comes into play\nNow it comes in at night when\nWe all do this we lay in bed\nStressing out about what we have to do tomorrow what we didn't finish today oh my gosh did I leave the did I shut the garage to lock the doors that I Do whatever whatever whatever the scenario whatever list you're making in your mind is what sometimes interrupts our body from relaxing enough to fall asleep properly\nAnd saw him fusion sleeps takes the beauty of what's in him in our in our whole food hemp complex and we combine it with another nutrient called pharma gather\nThey just want to relax and fall asleep I just want to like sedate themselves and kind of just ... that you know what a match and if you could have all the energy you want but not feel stressed out that's kind of the goal is to give you that daytime non sedative kind of balance and just awesome feeling and that's where him fusion stress comes into play now it comes in at night when\nWe all do this we lay in bed\nStressing out about what we have to do tomorrow what we didn't finish today oh my gosh did I leave the did I shut the garage to lock the doors that I Do whatever whatever whatever the scenario whatever list you're making in your mind is what sometimes interrupts our body from relaxing enough to fall asleep properly\nAnd so him fusion sleeps takes the beauty of what's in hemp\nIn our in our whole food hemp complex and we combine it with another nutrient called pharma gather in pharma gathers more natural form of ... the amino acids gather it helps to relax the mind it's not a sedative it's simply something that helps to relax the mind and stops those overwhelming lifts from being made so that when you try to relax\nYour mind is also going to be relaxed so that you can fall asleep properly and allow the normal process of sleep to take place and what does that lead to it leads to waking up in the morning refreshed\nAnd not feeling overwhelmed or lethargic or even somewhat drugged up for hung over from whatever medication or product you took that helps you sleep see some dating somebody as forcefully putting them to sleep helping someone relax properly so that you fall asleep naturally is the right way to do this and that's what we're going for\nAnd you know when it comes to discomfort those aches and challenges that we all deal with we know that ... has been studied in this area no question with all these valuable nutrients but then there are certain ... and one I loved to bring up is called beta ... and that's a\n... a ... not a lot of people talk about but works with the ... system\nThat helps to support you know healthier inflammation response and there's actually a lot of really good research on it and it's something that's natural in our products because we have a complete Turpin profile and ...\nCan happen on profile as well as a mega profile and so on we look at this as we like to call the whole food him complex so we really tried to approach the products in a way that helps to give someone support it's not meant to treat mitigate or\nYou know do anything with disease states and so forth in fact you know you don't cure disease by taking a supplement\nYou know you know it's so much more complicated you need medical care you need to make sure that you have someone in your corner from a medical perspective that can\nThat can monitor and help you when you have those challenges but nourishing the body from a food or nutritional perspective is a valuable tool and equipping the body so that it can be powered so that when you do go to a medical professional and so on your body might be in a better position and that's the whole goal is to keep your body nutritionally supported\nSheets and I also want to you know asked you to its we also have your digestion in yeah I have you with us Idaho and if they know that are in there and again it's keeping yourself and talent so many people's so off now you make me from him\nHe was in I guess is that an enzyme that used to not in their plane toilets\nUm I been on your radio show several times um with Dr Dan and stuff like that and so um I also own the company ... which is a probiotic company and we we you know some of the things that I share with people intimately is that I used to be the chief science officer for a country like vitamins I was there for Fifteen Years I designed\nI don't know probably about three hundred of their products are so I'm very passionate love that company very deeply there an amazing amazing company\nBut in two thousand eleven um I unfortunately fell ill with a challenge and my dad justice system and it was a very serious challenge now my products didn't cure me at all\nThe ... you know the nights that are in there and again it's keeping yourself and balance so many people die in snow off and now you make a great from him fusion I guess is that an enzyme that used to going on in their plane to our listeners that going on\nAbsolutely um I been on your radio show several times um with Dr Dan and stuff like that and so um I also own the company ... which is a probiotic company and we we you know some of the things that I share with people intimately is that I used to be the chief science officer for a country like vitamins I was there for Fifteen Years I designed\nI don't know probably about three hundred of their products are so I'm very passionate love that company very deeply there an amazing amazing company\nBut in two thousand eleven hum I unfortunately fell ill with the challenge and my digestive system and it was a very serious challenge now my products didn't tear me at all not at all I had to have medical intervention because it was very very serious in fact none of my products even existed at the time\nBut the reason why I developed all the products that I did was because I was inspired by what took place with me and hoping that I could encourage others to understand if they take better care of their digestive system of this physical system ... system in their body they might quite possibly deal less with challenges in their life because\nI Will tell you I Believe disease starts in the got and I believe that\nThe guy is a very intuitive environments in fact the gut brain connection is very key and we know that and there's a lot of really good research\nSo the spirit of is that with him fusion digestive we took\nA half of a capsule of microbial in Colin support and partition did one of the capsules while also taking my five porno which was our first product with him fusion and combining the two together you know you have a large number of what they call C B to receptors in the gut\nAnd these are receptors in the ... system and so what's really important about this is that in order to restore balance not only from good bacteria like probiotics which is what's in the ... digestive specifically biscuit dough bacterium primarily\nYou also support the digestive system by supporting the ... system and so this fusion digestive really helps to give a one two punch in helping to support that just of health and that's why we did it um and it's very very key so many people deal with digestive challenges of all kinds and so all the\nTime yeah absolutely and so you know the whole idea was that while if I could tell somebody to take parochial and Colin support and the him fusion five four no that's like the perfect Colombo but for that person that's unwilling to take more than one supplement I combined it in one so that it made a deficient an\nEasy as best I could still the best way to do it would be used parochial and Colin support them in ... and five porno that is the best way to do it it's what I Do personally however for that convenience sake confusion digestive was created\nHey so we had a question can and should go back to sleep\nUm fusion product that you have here I'm just\nCalling to ask you know she has another in her nineties but we have and that's pretty much the only health and she had and they just put her on a mild sedatives tiny she's been happening but it's kind of knocked out for a couple of days since she was when I was a product that would be beneficial to her\nOn that for anybody I think that was you know question a lot of people I I don't want to feel you know what will be knocked out for a while so you know what can you do you think about that one for her\nHere's the deal obviously I Can't ... comments about the a fit because that's you know she should definitely be under the care of a health care practitioner and so forth\nUm and and always looking at something to that effect I Will tell you that you know it is not uncommon for people to really stressed out a little bit when their heart is giving them challenges and so you know some of the things that can come as a result of that are definitely challenging and so I understand why a doctor might because of the circumstances prescribe or do something with the courage to a sedative or something\nI asked you know she has a mother who is in her nineties but with a thin and that's pretty much the only health issue she has and but they just put her on a mild sedatives for some anxiety she's been having but it's kind of knocked her out for a couple of days so she was wearing if this is a product that would be beneficial to her\nI'm asking for anybody I think that was you know the question a lot of people ask why don't want to feel you know one will be knocked out for a while so you know what could you do you think about that one for her\nWell here's the deal obviously kids ... comments about the aphids because that's you know she should definitely be under the care of a health care practitioner and so forth\nUm in in always looking at something to that effect I Will tell you that you know it is not uncommon for people to really stressed out a little bit when their heart is giving them challenges and so\nYou know some of the things that can come as a result of that are definitely challenging and so I understand why a doctor might because of the circumstances prescribe or do something with cards to a sedative or something to calm them down but you know sometimes those are ... die out of the pain related drugs or other types of drugs that are mild or even more severe tranquilizer type effect from\nYou know I Will tell you this um I Can't say what a product like this would do in conjunction with a cardiovascular disease that's illegal you can't really talk about that but I can tell you that when dealing with stress\nUm our stress formulas designed\nTo give you an herb that has been scientifically studied ... it has been studied in human studies to give people I'm somewhat of an effect of release or relief from\nThe toxic effects of what stress does to us\nAnd so it has somewhat of a calming effect but without being sedative and when you combine that with balancing me into a ... system can be a very valuable tool whether or not it fits for this particular person you know in a situation like this as much as I Want to give those answers I always fall to\nYour most copartner that I don't mean from a dictator perspective copartner with your health care professional\nTo get good advice on what makes sense for their protocol I'm not a believer that we should ... people were just 'cause they're stressed out I Believe that we should take a different approach but I always leave it to the hands of the doctor who do best file so\nSo is it properly and respectfully\nYeah no it's a great answer you know we always say that you know we don't treat diagnosis or care you know ... but we get fat trying to educate people and help them to make the best decisions for them and love 'em to collaborate with you know other providers because I Do believe it's a team approach a hundred percent of health so yes\nShe and I

I Will give you some credit for one thing there was no World Series hang over these guys are really a great so you they they were right on top of it they got you don't get to where you are if you don't win but Boswell they represent\nTwo years in a row is it's pretty amazing it really is not done every day and\nBut bought Boston get this year some numbers you want some numbers she might be some celebrities in numbers when Boston is ahead after eight innings take ask what the record is one hundred and one one hundred and one and then yeah\nOne hundred eleven what Iraq although we're trying to get to the Celtics you got to get to him early and hold them back that's about as impressive as they'd get it really is they had the most wins in the regular season to representing the American league for a reason\nWe talked about that that division the Yankees had a hundred Tampa Bay head over Ninety and that wasn't enough to win the division that was insane at the numbers the well he was saying that over a hundred as well there were three oh yeah it's over a hundred but I Wonder if they had those numbers let's go over to the other side there let's talk about the ... the Dodgers are looking pretty good here\nYeah it's been an interesting series there have been a lot of sub plots slug outta man which I Do yes I Do not have that but a council who is used to be a diamond back and he's been with Milwaukee\nSee when Boston is ahead after eight innings take ask what the record is one hundred and one one hundred and one and then yeah\nOne hundred and eleven what Iraq or trying to get to the Celtics you got to get to them early and hold them back that's about as impressive as they'd get it really is they had the most wins in the regular season to represent the American league for a\nReason we talked about that that division Yankees had a hundred Tampa Bay head over Ninety and that wasn't enough to win the division that was insane at the numbers the lower Houston out over a hundred as well there were three oh yeah it's over a hundred but I Wonder if they had those numbers let's go to the other side they're less about the ... the Dodgers are looking pretty good here\nYeah it's been an interesting series there have been a lot of sub plots slug outta man which I Do yes I Do not have that but a council who is used to be a diamond back and he's been with Milwaukee organization he's doing great things he's been starting his relief guys you'll have started to go for maybe two innings\nElders as long as they can and then he'll literally put six seven different guys in\nIn game five he started weighed Miley for one batter and now Miley is going to start tonight uh-huh so he's the fourth pitcher in the modern era oh start to postseason games in a row\nToo in a row yeah so I counseled ears might get council put in Mali so Roberts could set his line up okay and if you're sitting in a South Park and if they did yeah he pitched a Ballenger then brought in a right hander\nBecause we had our adjustments for a left handed out and just going to take it sure okay I Believe they can\nAll right so we will live with that because I think it's going to be the Dodgers in Boston I Hope I I Do like he's just that one step below that the Dodgers just got a well there you\nKnow Milwaukee's an exceptionally if they win they'll learn it they they will ... there are a great team I I just think the Dodgers have a lot of firepower they seem\nTo play to the level of their competition yeah when they should I think they're better than Milwaukee but they're not displaying the power that they did earlier they're not as patient at the plate yeah they're not I am not agree\nWith that uh I agree with that okay so we're looking at Boston Boston at the Dodgers which is the opposite of what I picked but that's okay let's get on there and see them play some football ... S C I think played Stanford a good game last night they seem to a short one day or late thank you\nYeah I I was ... I was at game and it just appeared as though they weren't out of it I don't know if there's a disconnect between her him and his coaches in his coaches and the players are very undisciplined team they made a lot of mistakes and you're ... you're playing the Stanford team you know exactly what you're going to get a physical\nA Sanford had a couple of bone had mistakes as well but they had one good quarter the third quarter they wound up one of the game twenty to thirty I mean I don't know what age you can take away from this game\nThey've got the best receiver and the country and Stanford literally shut him down you're not supposed to happen\nNow they doubled him throughout the entire game and they'll get better harms going to do All right I I've had it feel\nGood I Hope he has the patience that's all I'm going to say because he's not dealing with grown men now he's dealing with kids that's right that have extra curricular activities on their mind they've gotten academics on their mind so it's up to these patient\nYeah All right sounds good let's go through some games on the weekend I'll start with the big blue and little brother a big gala Jim horrible we every ... yes and um\nHe has yet to beat Ohio State or Michigan State but I don't know it's it's closed collectively as the best team that he is coached their defense is by far and away the best defense he's had a little\nThat officers pretty good ... good runner you got pat shape Patterson back there and you've got some good receivers now I\nI Know that they just have to we said all the times you don't put the ball on the carpet no stupid penalties just go into East Lansing and do what you do and keep the quarterback\nTara game and they'll get better harms going to do All right I I've had it feel\nGood I Hope he has the patience that's all I'm going to say because he's not dealing with grown men now he's dealing with kids that's right that have extra curricular activities on their mind they've gotten academics on their mind so it's up to these patient\nYeah All right sounds good let's go through some games that we can start with the big blue and little brother a big gala Jim horrible we every ... yes and um\nHe has yet to beat Ohio State or Michigan State but\nI don't know it's it's closed collectively as the best team that he coached their defense is by far and away the best defense he's had\nA little that officers pretty good ... good runner you got pat shape Patterson back there and you've got some good receivers now I I Know they just have to say it all the time she don't put the ball on the carpet no stupid penalties just go into East Lansing and do what you do and keep the quarter back on the bench\nKeep that Korea I kind of a well and keep keep your quarterback off his duff if\nMichigan plays Michigan State likely played Wisconsin they will win the game ... one heck of a game that I could not believe how well\nThere's not as much at stake you know what happens when the boys from East Lansing in Ann Arbor get together and he said he's ready they could be both one in eight and zero in\nAnd you'd have to worry that have on our absolutely did have the greatest game on earth but I'm of course you know I'm going with my blue\nI'm sure I I I'm going I'm right there with you I think if they play their game and ... as I'm ready mentally and they burn out uh-huh you know if you get all your emotions out early and then you just play your game yeah the when\nI'm pretty good on upsets why did the west Virginia I Would say gay because that was off of the week at a number to call another one and I know it's it's not because I'm so prejudice against Ohio State which I Would not be I Would always be very fair and loving\nUm which is ally but they're going into ... and I think it will be ready for them if anything I I'm looking at a good game I really am they're only open every day when\nYou get a good game but not for sixty minutes I think so though I think the reason they'll get fired up something could have happened well I think it's closer because they got let down emotionally when Nick ... stated that he's dropping out of school yeah and it's going to rehab on his own I I thought I was getting regular ball program he's dropping out of school yeah and that could really\nAre mostly target these guys were asked to cook so I'll go is that what are they needed ... votes against Ohio State it's something like that where unexpectedly below let your team down but it's next man up\nIts next man about I'm sure so letters the urban Meyer which is you know that's when my wife shops urban Meyer um he'll have that team ready though I think it will have to pay but I'm looking at that just that little bit of an upset a cabinet it's possible that here comes another game now Nebraska Minnesota and I think the Bradley if their first game\nThey just got I watch I came last week they went to ... they do they really really well and they ... they had it had all the I think it was ten points are asking you ...\nAnd that's just a got a darn right there in ... Minnesota will see I don't know any more because I just feel so bad for those kids okay but I I vote for him every week now even though when I was a kid I Would never ... you'd watch my mouth all the help of ice melt anything positive about Nebraska\nThat's right here we go there we go on this is what game I think worth watching Auburn an old miss oh yeah I just think that is going to be a good have our favorite by only two points and and and their ... and they're going to the old mess they always play hard\nGames over all those listen we're right in the middle of division right when you see those games are going to be brutal they're going to beat each other up it's going to be able to play a good game Auburn it's been a roller coaster played well they played poorly and they're certainly not as good personnel wise as they have been in the past so we'll have to see what was\nGoing wrong with that and yeah okay I'm a couple of other quick ones do you feel like Arizona snore that are faster I Utah usa that should be\nBecause I just feel so bad for those kids okay but I I vote for him every week now even though when I was a kid I Would never ... you'd watch my mouth all the way up a vice that anything positive about Nebraska\nThat's right here we go there we got this is what game I think worth watching Auburn an old mess oh yeah I just think that is going to be a good gave our favorite by on a two points that ad and their ... and they're going into the best they always play hard\nGained all those listen we're right in the middle of division right when you see those games are going to be brutal they're going to beat each other up it's going to be able to play a game Auburn it's been a roller coaster played well they played poorly and they're certainly not as good personnel wise as they have been in the past so we'll have to see what\nWill go along with that and say okay I'm a couple of other quick ones do you feel like Arizona snore that are faster I Utah usa\nThat'd be a good game to Utah tough you know is a tough to Utah put her on a very good Stanford team is the game at the coliseum or is it in Utah it's an Utah wow a se better be ready because they're Utah tough\nI'll do what I think I I so agree with that but I ... I think it's more I Want the jets when they're ... I think it's more I Want to just what now let's go to the four games that are the tough games are going to be the fun games New Orleans at Baltimore while I was on his but still at Baltimore deeds\nEx it's it's much better I don't know what the weather's going to be like in historically New Orleans doesn't play as well away as it does at home is through a there's an energy level that's different but if I wanted to have anybody in my back that would be Drew Brees Kamala or I mean they got guy\nThey got guys say how do they really got guys\nI'm a real one real quick thing to we were talking about Christian McCaffrey a whole lot I Know his his little brother Luke ... is a quarterback and Michigan correct yes yes he's been he's a good runner too had another brother played at Duke away my whole family kept freezer everywhere everywhere let's go to another Carolina at Philly\nI'm expect they attacked down drag out yeah if I Am\nIf Caroline it doesn't get bud hurt early by the success of Philadelphia Philadelphia in the past has been a slow team but this year they've gotten off when they play well they've gotten off really fast Hi Caroline has got to keep it close you know\nWell Caroline's kinda the same way they get off pretty quickly to here in Oakdale camera on that score before you start\nHere's the deal I'm so glad that they did acquire a guy like Christian McCaffrey has\nThe Kelvin Benjamin trade still hurts them now they've got your boy from Michigan and I don't you stay out of that budget so there that's all he's been making some numbers they're going to need to put everything together because Philadelphia's tough and they're just gonna keep rolling I mean they've got ... ... is the guy that will just come out and have a good game two or three games so I like Philadelphia and\nI like Philly and escape because it's at home to this is another one I I'll take the home team in a heartbeat when I see that the match up now here's this going to be interesting Dallas at Washington yeah and I think it's a Sunday night game if I'm if I'm not I believe\nPhiladelphia in the past has been a slow team but this year they've gotten off when they play well they've gotten off really fast Hi Caroline has got to keep it close you know\nWhat I was kinda the same way they get off pretty quickly to here in oak hill camera on that score before you start\nHere's the deal I'm so glad that they did acquire a guy like Christian McCaffrey has\nThe Kelvin Benjamin trade still hurts them now they've got your boy from Michigan and I don't you stay out of that budget so there that say oh he's been making some numbers they're going to need to put everything together because Philadelphia's tough and they're just gonna keep rolling I mean they've got ... ... is the guy that will just come out and have a good game two or three games I like Philadelphia and\nI like Philly and escape because it's at home to this is another one I I'll take the home team in a heartbeat when I see that the match up now here's this going to be interesting Dallas at Washington\nYeah and I think it's a Sunday night game if I'm if I'm not I believe so yeah and I don't watch Dallas I still think we only lost by less than a field goal but I think Washington is ready for these guys this year I think these guys\nAre played on Washington's reading another divisional game debt where they just I mean they hate each other it's got to be one of the worst I think the bears and the Packers are the raiders Broncos this goes right there the cowboys ... um and the rich get\nWhy it's like you know you have those guys that are always in there the cowboys last week played the most complete game I've seen them in a in probably several years I mean they put her on a very good Jacksonville team they never let them back in the game\nAs equal Eliot played well jak played well ah the little receiver from SMU played well\nI had shades of Russell Maryland and Hollywood Henderson coming off the line that way they were handling that line they got ... adds a big boys and\nYou know they've they've they've got guys at a really really I mean really aggressive that defense is playing very well could be weeks in a row I I liked Dallas in\nDallas yes and I like Washington the home team but but I Will never forget the doomsday defense that they had their though well\nThese low there was a guy that was such a great these guys are are really I mean I Can't stress enough they're really aggressive or J. Smith I think is one guy and then they have a league or the linebacker when he's healthy So Jon Lee yeah so I mean Dallas has got guys\nThat they have guys let's go one more let's go to the Monday Night game the giants at Atlanta now horrible\nI feel so bad for sake one Berkeley\nI I really do um he's the only guy and I I can say this was certainly he's the only guy that is playing like a pro I'm fat comes at now back him as a child he'll answer here and now he's got his buddies shepherd involved and now he went after you lie to extremely talented receivers they're great oh how to read\nBut everything else is off the field back I'm actually came out and said listen why don't you just take me for what I Do on the\nField and not often feel well because you're off the field stuff overshadows you're under achieving a ... I ... on her ever understand that the ... that are like that don't understand is going to have a short career with a smaller market team or New York\nJust doesn't have the talent ... has no time to pass the ball I mean he dumps the ball off a lot yeah let's have held if they didn't have sake one Barkley I don't even know\nWhat they would do with their office I mean say going back they had a just an incredible game last week uh I just don't want this young man to get hurt or I don't want him to be mentally deterred because he's listening to what's going on in that locker room just keep your head down and play your games help the coaches are instilling that end it because he's far too talented\nAt I hold back on learns from desert Brian because a lot of people didn't want does probably because of the outfield activities well all the yelling and screaming and hollering and\nHe's still unemployed if I'm not mistaken as he is still a little less let the matter is a good way\n... on her ever understand that ... that are like that don't understand\nIs going to have a short career with a smaller market team or New York\nJust doesn't have the talent ... has no time to pass the ball I mean he dumps the ball off a lot yeah let's have held if they didn't have sake one Barkley I don't even know what they would do with their office I mean say quote mark they had a just an incredible game last week uh\nI just don't want this young man to get hurt or I don't want him to be mentally deterred because he's listening to what's going on in that locker room just keep your head down and play your game they hope to coaches are instilling that because he's far too talented\nAt I hold back on learns from desert Brian because a lot of people didn't want does probably because of the field activities well all the yelling and screaming and hollering and he's still unemployed if I'm not mistaken as he is still a little less let the matter is a good way receiver can't take that away no he's a formidable receiver you still want to Iran or\nThe juice is not worth the squeeze and like that's what back in mid better understand is that people will get tired of your antics in a hurry\nNow this isn't about you it's about coaches it's about a ... it's about\nTheory it's about getting it out if you want to be part of the the program than than keep your mouth shut and play football if not you're going to find yourself on another team\nOkay we have less than a minute left but the my thoughts on what's happening to the jaguars\nI'm either getting out physical about all of a sudden\nI mean they were playing good I mean that was playing\nReally good teams yeah that's what they really are playing so good I mean when you go play Kansas City you're not going to have a cake win a game you know ... yeah I have a two year they will they overlooked or they overlooked Dallas so they went in they went into Eighteen to your diet as they were going to have a field day intimidate some guys and it turned out to be the exact opposite plus\nBlake Bartels you're seeing his human side\nAs we're good weather going away but it was out without for net there they can establish that run so therefore you've got to try and establish everything other than that it's extremely difficult to do\nOr their defense is still just fantastic but they're on the field way too much and that's the common that that's that's a crime is bringing a league I don't care how good you are\nIf you don't balance if you're a ... I mean because deep into guys would come off the field St guys you got to get it first down yeah at least we got to sit down I had to catch your breath you gotta kinda got especially the third and fourth tours man I mean you need a blow because that's when everybody else's\nYou know trying to get down to conditioning you you wonder how condition these guys are lord knows they're making really

he put why king there to wave at everybody and act like he was his twin brother\nAnd then he he was walking Castro's they well they were yelling at me and I was going back no weeds Joaquin but that nobody really that [noise]\nOh man I Would have thought it was there as a foreign policy analysis oh my word but yeah that he they are legit the\nAlexandria Ocasio Cortez equivalent\nMan\nSo that's the thing if you if you ask questions and apparently you are conducting a whisper campaign\nAnd then you have the story a\nYou have what me there was in the we're spending it s\nHere's some here a couple of other questions that I'm really curious about\nAnd I think it's worth asking\nWhy I think that these are nobody nobody wants to really ask any of these questions\n... a rite of of this\nAnd I think that again it's not a whisper campaign when you're trying to find out information\nFor instance there was a there's German media were saying that he was actually not just a journalist that he was actually secretly this activist or or this operative\nAnd that he was a because of his association with the Muslim Brotherhood this was a German media was reporting via PJ Media that uh and he was in his laments that he wanted to replace the Saudi monarchy with a modern Islam is ...\nThat he was bitterly opposed to their approach to the state of Israel\nAnd he ... he backs Palestinian and transient intransigence which we know it back Palestinian cause he tweeted once you're America you're nine eleven is our twenty four seven\nWe know that that's not even up for debate that came I actually had the tweet saved so he\nUh that was from his Twitter account\nThe center for security policy dug into it was looking at you know there's a lot there there's there that's why there's so much caution being used and drawing conclusions about all of this because the intelligence tablets meant I just don't trust them with the information that's coming from it and I definitely don't trust Iranian apologist so\nI mean I don't know if they're ... and I don't know if that's off\nIt is but here's the thing if he was a Middle East operative\nDoes to their approach to the state of Israel\nAnd he backed up he backed Palestinian and transient intransigence which we know it back Palestinian cause he treated my dear America you're nine eleven is our twenty four seven\nWe know that that's not even up for debate that came I actually had the tweet saved so he\nUh that was from his Twitter account\nThe center for security policy dug into it and was looking at you know there's a lot there there's there that's why there's so much caution being used and drawing conclusions about all of this because the and tell us tablets meant I just don't trust them with the information that's coming from it and I definitely don't trust Iranian apologist so\nI mean I don't know if they're ... and I don't know if that's off\nIt is but here's the thing if he was a Middle East operative why in the world would you have\nWhy would the Washington Post hire him\nAnd the New York times this is what I'm ... the New York times about cars showed him\nAfter a successful career as an advisor to an unofficial spokesman for the royal family of Saudi Arabia he had been barred from writing in the kingdom even on Twitter by the new crown prince\nSo in the United states he reinvented himself as a critic contributing columns to the Washington Post Palin asks why would oppose enable a former spokesman for the Saudi royal family to reinvent himself a contributing column\nThe New York times describes him as a quote political Islam is to quote forged a personal bond with President ... ... of turkey why would opposed to use as a columnist and Islamic pal of ear to one\nAnd the New York times also added that according to show the zone friends he joined the Muslim Brotherhood they said that he had stopped attending Brotherhood meetings but acknowledged that he quote remained calm conversant and its conservative Islamic and often anti western rhetoric which he could deploy or high depending on whom he was seeking to befriend in quote\nThat was the New York times that was saying this by the way\nThat wasn't and I have the link I had the story right here at the Rand just on the fourteenth\nSo that's not conservative media carrying out a whisper campaign\nThat the New York times to their credit legit asking some questions\nOr or put in some information out there and a lot of individuals are wondering well then why does why why would the Washington Post hire this guy\nI think that's a good question\nAnd just that right there by itself makes it a lot more complicated than just the crown prince wrote a couple of columns by some duty to in life and decided to kill him\nI mean let's look at this from another angle\nIf the crown prince was aware and I seriously I'm Sorry but I just highly doubt\nThat his that people if people within his inner circle were involved I just highly doubt that those individuals acted rogue\nI've just really don't believe that they did\nAnd if so\nWhy would he go to this drastic\nTake this drastic undertaking\nAnd build it links\nTo kill a guy in broad daylight\nWhen you know there's cameras everywhere\nHe goes into the dang consulate\nSister did he goes to the Saudi Arabian consulate and turkey and its stand bowl\nAnd then you have what are your other\nWho's always with you know the crown prince he goes in there shortly after\nThat's pretty brazen\nNow you could say it's because he just really doesn't care I don't think it's because he really doesn't care because he has gone on the charm offensive for the past several months\nI think that there's at some point he thinks that I think the I\nI Do think that to a\nWhy would he go to this drastic\nTake this drastic undertaking\nAnd build it links\nTo kill a guy in broad daylight\nWhen you know there's cameras everywhere\nHe goes into the dang consulate\nJust did the he goes to the Saudi Arabian console and turkey and its stand bowl\nAnd then you have what are your other\nWho's always with you know the crown prince he goes in there shortly after\nThat's pretty brazen\nNow you could say it's because he just really doesn't care I don't think it's because he really doesn't care because he has gone on the charm offensive for the past several months\nI think that there's at some point he thinks that I think the I\nI Do think that to a\nTo a particular extent I think he\nHe doesn't care about repercussions\nHe just kind of shrugs it off\nI think that after this charm offensive\nThere's more than than just\nThere's more to it than that\nBecause you don't go to this you don't go to that the fact that this length\nGo all over the United states\nAnd you know show how you're really didn't\nUnveiling reforms\nWomen are driving your rolling back some of your your other regulations on you know say Christianity and other things and you're you're really taking a stand against Iran you say you support a a ... the state of Israel I mean that's huge in the Arab world in that region that's huge\nSo why would you go to that Lincoln have all of that carefully orchestrated to screw up like this was there a sense of urgency was there something else happening\nI mean that's just one in the world led to that and I think that's the big question\nBut this idea from the media that this is a conservative whisper campaign is really stupid\nBecause this was in New York Times that we're saying that he actually was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nNew York times isn't a conservative publication they hate me for crying out loud they run a profile of me I actually like to report I thought she was much more professional than some of the other local nut job to try to do pieces on me\nAnd end up writing fans thick\nAnd talking to people that you haven't seen since third grade but okay\nBut they're not even though there are biased and they make mistakes\nI don't think they're going to run something like that unless it was the worst\nThat's it and they're not a conservative publication so power\nThat that the narrative saying that it's a whisper campaign\nAnd I'm not saying that oh well he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood so that means he has to die\nThere's something else happening here\nPeople are to their

the last six months decided to become more pro Israel this isn't real reforms is more pragmatic politics and this guy was standing in the way of that with a Twitter following up to three million was starting to write more and more critical against the Saudis and they probably wanted to contain him\nWith that and the and that would make sense for the New York times had a ... it's just a few days ago where they wrote about his membership in the Muslim Brotherhood which is why I thought it was so weird that the Washington Post that it was\nConservatives that we're conducting a whisper campaign

and he was very much into political Islam and he was very much more extreme than\nSome of what was being promoted in the charm offensive by the Saudi crown prince and you just touched on on doctors after you just touched on\nA one of the other point I was going to ask you was whether or not that charm offensive and and all of this reform that we hear being discussed with the Saudi royal family and with Saudi leadership and policy if it was real reform or if it was more just sort of\nUm a way to to survive politically and you answered that for me\nYeah I mean NBS there's no more real reform or than to show the is according to the Washington Post contrary to what the Washington Post said two months ago because show he was writing about how the caliphate\nIs real the Muslim Brotherhood

they care what the human needs who were being massacred by the Saudis now all of a sudden the elites in Washington care about the human rights abuses of the Saudis went for eight years we couldn't get Obama's dimension once the name of a dissident in Saudi Arabia that we've been working to help\nThe I mean the reality is is that\nWe should change the way we're approaching hold them accountable we should not end arms deals but actually start to hold them accountable and the reason we shouldn't and the arms deal is that's a balanced against the Iranians there is nothing more\nBackslapping that's happening now than between the minister of foreign affairs and Syria and Iran and turkey that are cheering on ah the the\nDecrease in the stability of between the American and Saudi relationship\nYes and and and that would explain why all of a sudden it as you mentioned how that nobody really said anything about the president's silence the previous presidents silence and all of these ... and\nI and individuals that you name to our wrongly in print and I they haven't really said anything about them the or that the previous administration silence of it um but ... and those are all the same people that attacked everyone else that wanted to end that\nSafe to deal with Iran they seem to the apologies for Iran and I see them standing and exploiting the situation as a way to try to position I ran a little bit better do you see the same\nAbsolutely and that's the whole thing if you look at the the Ben Rhodes a you know\nFriends are what are they doing they're trying to find any way possible to resurrect on Obama legacy that wasn't about feeding a terrorist states Iran that was feeding a genocide in Syria and elsewhere to sort of resurrect stumped type of semblance of of rationality wish there wasn't any\nOf the Obama carry approach and now if you see secretary Pompeo trying to rebuild the relationship with the Saudis and tell them what's going to come if they show a picture of him smiling and all of a sudden that becomes a bizarre a photo op when in fact Carey was smiling with\nWith dictators tyrants in Iran and to run and Egypt and elsewhere and nobody thinks anything about that and it's just that in the yard to double standard I have to tell you\nIt breaks my heart as an American to see our values trampled on\nIn the name of sort of revisionist history\nBecause all they're worried about is the Democratic party's legacy under Obama rather than actually the real values and and here you have a Washington Post editorial board putting out an op ed things that we are trying to destroy a man's history and I said I might pod cast if I was the disappeared tomorrow\nI Would hope that my critics would continue to be critical of me because it's dishonest to all of a sudden become lying eyes of somebody and lie about them after they die when in fact you're just soldering their entire service in this guy's writings was anti\nDictators tyrants in Iran and to Ron in Egypt and elsewhere and nobody thinks anything about that and it's just that an yawned a double standard as to tell you\nIt breaks my heart as an American to see our values trampled on\nIn the name of sort of revisionist history\nBecause all they're worried about the Democratic party's legacy under Obama rather than actually the real value is an end here you have a Washington Post editorial board putting out an op ed things that we are trying to destroy a man's history and I said I might podcasts if I was to disappear tomorrow\nI Would hope that my critics would continue to be critical of me because it's dishonest to all of a sudden become lying eyes of somebody and lie about them after they die when in fact you're just altering their entire service and this guy he's writing was anti Israel anti western he was not part\nOf the secular liberal democratic movement of the middle east is just a lot\nNow last question for you Dr gesture and we're talking to doctors any jobs are here on them where we appreciate your time so I mean obviously we we can't have allies or or or anyone with and we are associated\nBehaving like that we don't want them to behave in a way where they're killing people in broad daylight and they really don't seem to worry about the repercussions of it how should the administration handled is with Saudi Arabia so as to not destabilized that relationship and then give Iran a leg up and go and and and further empower them\nI think we do a little more than we did for example the Russian when they use the chemical weapon and assassinated individual in the u._k.\nWe basically told them number one we put sanctions against some other wealthiest individuals in Saudi Arabia so that we have them pay a price where it hurts which is in the oil industry number two we demand that they're released prisoners that we know we've been asking for their release Canada just that a conflagration with\nTheir foreign minister and the Saudis where they ask for rape better we will lead ... really\nSay that you know what if you guys really didn't mean to do this then released these older prisoners so that you can at least show that you're heading towards some liberalization\nAnd third I think we hold them accountable with transparency into the future about not only human rights but about thing you know what we're going to stop doing the operations in Yemen are there are some American planes being used there I think we tell them that's enough stuff do you know that we're not going to tolerate that any more though with the third part of it\nThere you know doctors any jets are always such a pleasure to talk with you I appreciate your expertise on this end for bringing some ... and bringing some perspective and or

here today is Damon Janice who's the developer of the lifestyles discovery appraisal software and a game and as I said before we went to break up like you just walk through and tell people the multitude of things that the software does for you\nI think another over the yard and you'll be really interested in and if I wanted to share that with you I went back and I did aquarium that database or a couple of months ago and over the last ten years that we've had the uh appraisals offered there have been two million evaluation\nSo why why it alive and and then I when I started going up and you're talking about twenty minutes before we had this topic of the valuation now take like a minute or so much out there so I calculated it about fifty nine years of productivity with all of the evaluation that people have been doing a\nPretty cool [laughter] ah I'm so so what does it\nReally from over the years which made the program even harder to make it clear but it makes them more powerful so what you do is you go and you enter an address the subject property address that you want to evaluate\nAnd it takes ... crunches numbers for a couple of seconds and that brings up a screen that shows you what the failed value for the property\nAnd a confidence level associated with that amount of shows do you rent value purpose what you've written before and the confidence about those are the first to the commission have and most cases\nWhere you can just go with those numbers now there's also a teacher or\nI calculated it saved about fifty nine years of productivity with all of the evaluation that people have been doing a\nPretty pretty cool if Iraq [laughter] um so so what the system does it\nActually really simple years which made the programming harder to make it simpler but it makes them more powerful so what do you do is you go and you enter an address the subject property address that you want to evaluate\nAnd it takes an crunches numbers for a couple of seconds then that brings up a screen and it shows you what the sales by us for the property\nAnd a confidence level associated with that amount of shows you you rent value as a puppy or what you rent before and the confidence about those are the first two bits of information that you have in most cases\nYou can just go with those members now there's also a feature where you can look at detailed comfortable so you want to see what all the properties are similar to the subject property how much they spoke for in the last three or six months and it shows you all that information\nUm and and occasionally you want to go and if the confidence is low on sale or wins I Want to go and watch those details but most of the time you don't even need to do that 'cause they pay to get\n'em and then what also happen if a priest fills out the cash flow calculator and\nUh and all you need to do is put in like ... rent and you want to but again based on that valuable you stop at what price you want to\nWhat you plan on purchasing the property for you put those two pieces of information and the calculator crunches all the numbers\nAnd end up at like instantaneous but very very hot so what it tells you how much cash out of pocket\nIt will require to purchase property and that depends on your financing whether it's a conventional loan or hard money around at private financing whatever it handles all those scenarios they'll tell you how much money is going to take to to purchase the property\nAnd then it gives you poor pieces of information and they tell you if it's a\nGreat deal or not and that is it it shows you the unreal I've kept from Jamie you'll have your annual cash flow and then it will tell you you're percent return on the capital gains\nPercent return on the cash flow and so once you have that information\nOr which again it just takes just a few seconds generate very very fast um when you you can say okay that looks like a really good deal I Want to move forward with it or\nIt's not and I'm just going to go check the next property so you know you can you can run through the snake in detail in the morning when you're a breakfast and this term really quite can just stay on top of that and he gets a feels\nSo once you have the evaluation of course it's been keeps track fall out of all that and uh and you can um you can go back to the previous evaluation of what you bad in the numbers and\nUm you can make copies of the evaluation is we can export them into a Pdf file them into your real estate agent\nUh can um do all those kinds of things you can add notes evaluation of and you can remember here that we're making\nYou know it's a really come a long way to solve the problem that we had in the past\nWas that we couldn't get the correct information now we're not only getting the information you're giving us a percentage of accuracy or how does act as a software program come up with a suspected percentage of accuracy\nYeah it's really interesting because the data that's been years comes from a multitude of more sort of like a ... the MLS you know there's some other data that's available there's public information there's private information that companies\nWe can export them into a Pdf file them into your real estate agent uh can um you can do all those kinds of things you can add notes the evaluation of and you can remember here that we're making\nYou know it's a really come a long way to ... the the problem that we had in the past\nWas that we couldn't get the correct information now we're not only getting the information you're giving us a percentage of accuracy or how does act as a software program come up with a suspected percentage of accuracy\nYeah it's really interesting because the data that's being used comes from a multitude of sort of like a ... the last\nYou know if some of the data that's available there's public information there's kind of information that companies house so the data providers that we're using are collecting all of the nation and depending on the source it's more reliable or less reliable and so they have\nA an evaluation model that it's kind of an algorithm that goes that based on all of this\nInformation for this particular property law signed up for them and it reminds me of something I Want to mention wrote quite a lot of people got below order to do their evaluation because they'll have like a sail value on a ...\nYou have to be very careful with that because their data is is very problematic I had a subscriber emailed me out about a month ago\nAnd he said you're you know I spoke discoveries showing you the property is worth a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and the oil is telling you it's worth a hundred and eighty thousand dollars and I went and I looked at the comparable and there's no way that property is worth a hundred thousand could all the comfortable for\nA hundred and Fifteen hundred and thirty thousand dollars\nAnd so you know the softer space on making a huge mistake and going and pay too much for a property but I dated at his own party and I'm confident that fine to the sale value and the red\nValue is so helpful because you know when you get like a Ninety five percent confident on the wrist by all of your debt and you don't have to worry about that it was a very powerful\nYou know I remember reading an article once and it was a long time ago so don't remember the exact percentages are so I welcome you to look it up on the Internet to verify what I'm saying a for everybody's lifting but I had read this article where just below had gotten the suit\nBecause people were making decisions on a data that wasn't an accurate and ... had to come back and part of the risk to she wants to admit\nThat they were like only Ninety they're they're like Ninety five percent inaccurate in other words if they said it's worth a hundred and ten thousand dollars\nThere is a Ninety five percent chance the wrong not right but raw some candidates are now and go about no I don't know if that meant they were wrong by one dollar or one hundred and five dollars he bought what I'm saying but it was Ninety five percent of the data was wrong that was just blew my mind\nThat I probably should looked at a price state that but I'm I'm well become you look it up and see how close I came to that\n... but I think I heard about that and\nIt's a it's been a problem and and and then my you know when we were evaluating that project a year ago and I was starting to get data from different providers and I was working at the landscape I with the parents to MLS pay there we can occur to you know all these different sources\nAnd and below was consistently and you know off of what of what the numbers but I was saying\nBut he just has to be real careful I mean I I professional investor should not be used any free data\nWe should look at a price state that but I'm I'm welcome you to look it up and see of course I came to that\nAre ... but I think I heard about that and\nIt's a it's been a problem and and and then my\nYou know when we were evaluating project a year ago and I started with that data from different providers and I was working at ... if I were to Paris to MLS pay their fair to you know all these courses\nAnd and below was consistently you know off of what the numbers that I Would think it'd be really careful I met\nOne you find that the the meaning that we talked about of Ninety five thousand dollars but if you look at the people from fifty sixty sixty one in other words not a whole group of working class people right now but only people from fifty sixty sixty one the last five years quote unquote\nTheir average or they're mean as a hundred and twenty four thousand dollars\nI'm Sorry a hundred and

I just said the story earlier we all pretty much there's somebody in everyone in every family probably that has a a child with a disability so right to number down before he does seven three seven eight one zero eight you can also check her out on my TV show this weekend Saturday\nEleven to noon on channel seven eight the TV you can check her out there too um okay let's go back and chewing treatments did they have for autism\nWell the treatments that they have are typically working on behaviors they have speech and language therapy that's very helpful\nUm it it's really important to start those therapies\nAs soon as you can so identifying the child is so important and so I you can get help through education through your doctor or through a psychologist\nSomebody that can steer you in the right direction to make sure that your child is the value waited and identified so you can start those treatment so you said that you\nHave a plethora of a of um ... resources as well as someone listening to this and they feel comfortable there listening to you and they said you know I'd like to call her to see she's a specialist has them on which they call you and you can help direct them as to maybe we're\nToo uh they've all or who to call because they need to be assessed and is that correct\nThat's correct they would need an assessment to make sure because\nThere's lots of a disability butter similar I think I Am all the time [laughter] so\nUm so they would need in uh the assessments then to identify the child and ah they're welcome to call me at any time I do have um numbers people that they can reach out to you know neural psychologists and\nDoctors that you know specialize in autism and it's just we have to make sure they have the right um\nDisability identified so that we can create a program that's appropriate for them\nSo the number again is foray into ...\nSee he's a specialist in his ... on which they call you and you can help direct them as to maybe where to a ball or who to call because they need to be assessed is that correct\nThat's correct they would need an assessment to make sure because\nThere's lots of a disability butter similar I think I Am all the time [laughter] so\nUm so they would need in ah the assessments done to identify the child and ah they're welcome to call me at any time I do have um numbers people that they can reach out to you know neuro psychologist and\nDoctors that you know specialize in autism and it's just we have to make sure they have the right um\nDisability identified so that we can create a program that's appropriate for them\nSo the number again is foray into seven three seven eight one zero eight therefore locations throughout the states\nThey're they're it's K. through twelve which to understand that it is K. through twelve and the website is flax flex it\nAcademy dot com and also online you can go up there and you can see some of the resources that they have but she loves to talk to people they love to help you are all about helping them have the resources that they need and of course the children getting the children the help\nThat they need to get through school mhm on really easily\n[noise] absolutely absolutely it's all about it's child centered you know so everything is based on their needs\nLet's say the child medication and I don't know whether they do all that I feel I'm assuming they might write and are there and do you have like you know a way that the child can still be in school and be taking the medication\nWhat are what is the day look like well you know they could definitely\nIf they need medication we are going to make sure that that somebody is there to provide that for the students we sometimes have students that have a medical challenges and for some reason or another they art can't you know come to a school so we will send a teacher to their home to work with them as\nWell wow see that's what the flexibility is all a pig [laughter] flexibility that we're talking about here right oh let's talk about that even if they needed to file needed to stay home\nYou can actually work with them still because they would be the teacher just comes to them exactly so there's no ifs ands or buts about it if you're looking for your child to get through school in a very easy way this is the answer\nRight and we also have teachers on line so sometimes um children have such severe anxieties that they don't want somebody to come to the home they can't go to school so we have teachers on line that can work\nWith the child is wow that's awesome so they're really there for you to make sure that your child gets education that it they need as well as making it flexible as possible for them in every way shape or form gosh I Wish they did this for everyone\nYou know 'cause when I was a kid uh-huh and I'm a lot older when I was a kid I you know\nWell a lot of us probably had even he had a autism but we didn't know it you know you know they didn't do that they didn't look at that those years ago they said your kids in trouble all the time get it out of this you know yeah it goes way it was in those days\nUm and now it's wonderful because these children can get so much more right out of ... education and all of that so um the option you help them at let's talk a little bit about this to this is important to\nTuition how does that get done and how does that they pay for this tuition well\nThey can pay you know privately themselves but we also have usa funding and uh the STO scholarships so you know or the parents don't have to pay out of pocket that they can apply for that\nI was a kid uh-huh and I'm a lot older when I was a kid I you know\nWell a lot of us probably had even had a autism but we didn't know it you know you know they didn't do that they didn't look at that those years ago they said your kids in trouble all the time get it out of this you know yeah it does the way it was in those days\nAnd and now it's wonderful because these children can get so much more right out of an education and all of that so um the options you help them at\nLet's talk a little bit about this to this is important to\nTuition how does that get that done and how does that they pay for this tuition well\nThey can pay you know privately themselves but we also have you ever say funding and uh the STO scholarships so you know or the parents don't have to pay out of pocket that they can apply for that USAID funding and then it's\nPaid for and so that's another thing that they have this uh financial aid in such a way forward right as well\nAbsolutely so again they love to talk to you they do consultations with everyone the website again is flex its academy dot com their phone numbers foray do seven three seven eight one zero eight it's K. through twelve\nAnd it is the answer it's it's really the answer for you know these ... these parents that have their children that are miserable mhm or not going to school because they are miserable here it's just want to leave my home because it's better I don't even know if\nThey're allowed to do that or not but I'm sure they go through that\nYeah a lot of parents will pull their kids out and try to home school them but it's frustrating because they don't know the standards are what curriculum to use\nSo this gives them an option and all of our teachers are certified and so you know they get top notch education you know and uh we're meeting the standards and [noise] you know so I just want to make that clear and we only have three to four kids to a teacher\nLet's talk about ... so it's really almost one on one practically\nWell and if a child does need one on one we will provide that but typically we like to keep all more in a group so that they can practice social skills and we do a\nA once a month we do a social event and so we might go to the Sioux\nA something that the whole family can come to so they can practice of social skills as well\nAgain this is not just for you it might be someone that you know I Want people to understand I think this is so very important\nFor people to to share these things that you're hearing on here that's what it's all about and may not be you but you certainly might know someone and what this is a wonderful academy that you've made and I know a lot of people listening which they had a school like that when they were kids who go to because you really work with them and and the kids excel\nExactly they do um because you know any child that could have somebody work with him on one and one on ones can excel because you know you you have that attention there immediately reacting to what the child needs\nBut even in a small group of three to four students it's they they get that individualized attention that they\nNeed and like you said it's good for them because they need that that's one thing that they do you have tours to people can they come in\nAnd he flew let's talk about that too okay they can call and set up an appointment and we're happy to a show them what we do\nAnd uh you know come out and see if they think that might be a good fit for their student\nYeah now again they have for locations one is in Yuma the other one is on the west side the east side it's coming up soon and in Tucson and also on line again if you even need your teacher to go to the home they will even do that you can start off with one on one if that's the need of the child more than you\nYou have that attention there immediately reacting to what the child needs but even in a small group of three to four students it they they get that individualized attention that they\nNeed and like you said it's good for them because they need that that's one thing that they do have tours to people can they come in\nAnd he flew let's talk about that too okay they can call and set up an appointment and we're happy to a show them what we do and uh you know come out and see if they think that might be a good fit for their students\nYeah now again they have for locations one is in Yuma the other one is on the west side the east side it's coming up soon and in Tucson and also on line\nAgain if you even need your teacher to go to the home they will even do that you can start off with one on one if that's the need of the child more then you've got three to one which is perfectly op perfect as far as I'm concerned as well um and what would be your final words that you would want to tell them today\nAnd it's spelled H G.

you\nOkay so we have to talk about this too because one of the first things I think that people that are dealing with when they have skin issues their weight and all of that is their hormones yeah let's go backwards started we want as we started the beginning but really right now this is really the start of it All right it is I had\nSo we do bio identical hormones and pellets and so what the doctor does is he will give them an injection of light a cane and their hips so that's how they feel it's just the shot and then he makes a small incision\nGerman frack that everyone's getting entered into when both you or a man if you know to get something for the holidays the number is six so to to seven seven five three six nine and toll free it's one eight six six five to ... eleven hundred and everyone's getting entered into when it's a two hundred and fifty dollar value free to you\nOkay so we have to talk about this too because one of the first things I think that people that are dealing with when they have\nSkin issues their weight and all of that is their hormones yeah let's go backwards started we want as we started the beginning but really right now this is really the start of it All right\nIt is I had yeah so we do bio identical hormones in a pellets\nAnd so what the doctor does is he will give them an injection of light a cane and their hips so that's all they feel it's just the shots\nAnd then he makes a small incision and puts a pellet and that's the size of a grain of rice under their skin what's great about that is that your body takes what it needs when it needs that instead of taking a shot or a\nHill or rubbing a cream on of the same amount every day your body knows what it needs when it needs it\nSo the more cardiac output you're stressed you're exercising you're going to drum or about hormone and it treats all kinds of different things we have patients in their thirties and patients in their eighties it helps with libido energy\nYeah yeah but but here you know it's funny as the rate that the banks were charging six to eight months ago the rate we're at now so our rates are so much lower than the banks that were still doing loans under five percent even though all the headlines say race or you know five to five and a quarter so\nYou know it's one of those great times for us that we're broke or not a bank you know it ... with all the regulations all the Dodd Frank all the government changes over the last ten years it's the best time to go to a broker another bank because we have options talent that different or we have an option [laughter]\nWe well every you know we get we we have a lot of people coming into our office now I don't like to use the term but begging for mortgages they're I I don't want to say they're desperate but they're begging they're hungry okay that's a better word hungry we use hungry there\nAre a lot of banks were hungry for mortgages so what are they doing during lowering the rates they're trying to fill you know their portfolio and they need mortgages so the rates will be a quarter point even more uh even lower than you know the banks have point worth and some of the bank so it's a it's a big deal\nThat we're live on Facebook so we can also that after the show I see I thought you were staring at a little bit the last time yeah that you were on that we're not taste so everybody hates listening you can also just for me and that's what I did want to say something you know\nJust that uh right now it's it's a tough time to get a mortgage very very confusing you know even for us some days we we scratch your head at some of the policy some of the guidelines that that we have to deal with but we have the ability to go to you know different\nIs there I I don't want to say they're desperate but they're begging they're hungry okay that's a better word hungry we use hungry there\nAre a lot of banks were hungry for mortgages so what are they doing they're lowering the rates they're trying to fill you know their portfolio and they need mortgages so the rates will be a quarter point even more uh even lower than you know the banks have point where some of the bank so it's a it's a big deal\nThat we're live on Facebook so we can also that after the show I see I thought you were staring at a little bit the last time yeah that you were on that were not paid so everybody gets listening you can also this is just for me and that's what I did you want to say something no\nJust that uh right now it's it's a tough time to get a mortgage very very confusing you know even for us some days we we scratch your head at some of the policy some of the guidelines that that we have to deal with but we have the ability to go to you know different banks in and find you the best deal so it really is\nAnd now it's quite a bit hauled out are okay to have to go yet where your guide yeah exactly we talked about last yeah exactly\nSo have you found that to be the case for for most people that's what it is that you know that's different and that's what I liked about that that's the difference\nBetween the old days the old days it was all about the new closing costs to be honest it was now it's more about they just want someone's hand to hold and that's what we're there for you know to guide them behind it it's a difficult process nowadays\nTo get them the best deal yeah and that's something I talk about that okay all kidding aside one of the thing I don't know if I can do that came out try but one of the things that you do that I think that's really neat to is that when you are get somebody\nYou close your mortgage and you find a better rate yeah that's something that you do and I and I don't know that everybody does that\nYeah so somebody you know I had someone the other day that we we put in a loan last year and you know a few months ago I forget what it was but we put them in a mortgage their credit wasn't the best we can solve there's a bunch of debt and guess what their credit scores popped up\nSo now we're getting hungry so last time we were beggars never choose last time we had a low fight go score we had to find the best program given that cycle score\nBut now we get to really shop it and say hey one of those hungry banks at walk in how 'bout four point seven five no closing costs can you do it and this guy's got to use her you know not you know maybe seven twenty five ... scores now better scores now he's in better shape\nAnd so we do that for them we lower the rate again no clue you know closing costs you pay for the appraisal title underwriting so\nUm sometimes when you know you need to you you got to do two step process and so if you start paying closing costs that can get really expensive ... you know most multiple refinances so if you can keep the cost down or go no ... that's a better way to do it you make sense it if you can lower rate for free it just makes sense\nNow you could check them out its five star ratings
