neighbor which of course is banned by the\nJewish people in the Old Testament banned in the Christian Bible but it's not been by Charles Schumer and Dianne Feinstein in fact the entire Democratic Party seems to be run on a the tenant that you know by all means necessary that's a tentative communism\nPulling WABC is calling he claims to be a Muslim are you really a Muslim people\nOh no but I just I'm sort of on the corner and I just five ... five ... find out what they say\nAnd the water's look around and say about bearing false witness against my neighbor\nIs very simple if your neighbor is aimed for you though you're blessed by out of the ... that it was\nSo you mean if if you're not a non Muslim you can lie about them with with impunity\n... if you're in Laughlin and like\nI I got it now if you're a Muslim and you make up false charges against an enemy who's not a Muslim that's okay\nThat's fine if you're blessed by\nNow but what does it say let's let's stick to the other point one if a Muslim the famous another Muslim with false testimony watched the crime\nPunishment put it this way is that ... or the ... is a woman who is being raped for instance you need for men to a

the punishment [noise]\nWe don't know what what do you have to drive in Nineteen sixty five votes where I get for the rest of your life\nBut I don't like what are\nWhat will have to look it up a self I can verify that\nUh\nWe got great cause I'm not I'm not groping there's no grope there's no grow up I think I Need to lighten it up a bit we played Obama from a one way he says I was a thug I did illegal drugs I drank I drank six packs before going to school and somehow that didn't stop him from becoming a president\nWhile I've been waiting to do this I have I've just taken the salts to avoid the same thing here is my favorite gal Dianne Feinstein today on the FBI report listed they're complaining she didn't get a chance to read and listen to her oh two\nCandidly what we review today and the very limited time I was there I had to leave his ... his heart and\nI had the opportunity to review some but not all of it it looks to be a prime of an incomplete investigation well hold on wait a minute you didn't have time to read\nIt but you know it's incomplete uh the reporters incomplete and you didn't read it though\nSo here she is against first she destroys the man publicly now she acts like clean old Diane and uh it's it's an incomplete report\nAnd although the Democrats agree that the investigation should be limited they didn't say it should be limited actually they should that should be limited but not really limited and the way you know so now they're saying the reports incomplete and it's not a legitimate report listen to the next one in the next clip you\nKnow three Democrats agreed that the investigation so should be limited not agree that the White House should try\nSee if the ice handle only not\nOr said public testimony in last hearing it's a substitute for interviews by FBI agent holy ... stack\nOf dirty clothing you Kavanaugh has been subjected to three FBI investigations along\nThe road to becoming a federal judge [noise] how many investigations have applied to Dianne Feinstein or Charles Schumer [noise] for the alleged ties between another senator and radical Islam\nHow many FBI investigations count them zero [noise]\nSo yes America has made up its mind they definitely have seen the enemy [noise]\nHow many FBI investigations calcium zero [noise]\nSo yes America has made up its mind they definitely have seen the enemy [noise]\nWhy what Trump with twenty five choices you know we had twenty five people nominated him to be put up for the Supreme Court vote he only chose this guy a Bush man no less a Bush man not from the collar hurry but from\nThe Bush administration a Bush fan of uh Florida\nWhy did he pick cabin or liberal judge to begin with\nLook look what he got what this guy nothing but what heartache why didn't he picks the woman judge who was more qualified than Mr cabin or\nDo you think they would have subjected this woman through the same thing they did the cabinet no because she's a woman they couldn't have accused of rape or sexual harassment the most they could've says well she's not qualified because she's a you know pro life\nThat wouldn't have stopped it so ... so and in many ways Trump fell right into their hands incidentally I Know you don't want to believe that many of you under the false assumption that he knows everything nobody knows everything he's just a man like you\nVery bright great memory very strong we support him but he's just demand never forget that\nSo he made a mistake and picking cabinet amongst the twenty five so that becomes the next question for the political thriller called Savage Nation\nWho is it in his inner circle who steered Trump to picking cabinet over all the other judges so far as it oh no one's asked this question accept me for the last three weeks\nAnd I think it's a combination of the old guard in the federalist society as well as a certain individual in his inner circle who likes to display herself\nIn front of men on a fairly regular basis oh yeah there's someone in there who I have really bad feelings about when I was ushered into the president's\nAh the oval office of the time I visited April high point in my life it's a big moment I'll

it was almost like a bird of prey flying out of the office he was the last one in there before I met the president\nShe flew right by me like a like a dark thing flew by me my almost made us squawking sounded as she flew by my question is did he push it she and her people along with the federalist society the neo cons in order to that Trump up for a fall I don't know who did this\nThis is not even a cabin or get in this horrible\nHorrible horrible experience for America is something we could have avoided had he chosen amongst the twenty five choices the woman judge who was equally if not more qualified\nSo who is it in his inner circle who was probably a the leaker and be the the the ... the ... of the ship in the wrong direction or we'll never know\nWe can't know those things were just the little people\nWell that's a good question I just raise and I don't have an answer for it I'll be honest with you I Wish I did but I I've suspicions that's all I have\nThey really should hire me

F. P. M. C. P. A. as a masters in tax\nI'm a registered investment advisor so really all I Do is talk about money all day long and I've been talking to my clients about this for at least for years and the thing that I Would talk to them about what's going on with the federal government one of the largest line items on the federal government is the interest\nAnd as the interest rates have been very very very low um it's still had six seven eight hundred billion dollars of deficits which I had to explain to my clients\nThe government was not bringing in enough money in taxes to pay the bill which included the interest which meant they had to borrow money to pay the interest\nWhere are you talking about our government now under Donald Trump this is just this is federal lonely yes this is\nThe way I Want to get this just saying our government right now is is printing money to such an extent that they have to borrow money to pay the interest\nYup every time there's a news article where there's a deficit the deficit means they are not bringing in enough revenue to pay the bill and wondering\nSo in other words weight would let me just summarize for the people who are listening\nWe complain bitterly under Obama and the liberals when they tax and spend we said oh the Democrats stand for tax and spend well now we have an administration that stands for spending spent today on one hand cut taxes and they spend more than Obama did and you're saying that the the dislocation is so great that what's going to happen is what I Want to know\nWell I Will tell you what I'm Talking to my clients and they would say so what does that mean I Would say if you want to see what it's going to look like look at Greece does anybody know with Greece looks like as an economic powerhouse\nNo tell us what what was it a more weight how 'bout on our own hemisphere how bout of Venezuela could we go as bad as that\nYeah they're all the same I mean huge economic inequities when you're just not paying your bills and you're borrowing in your buttering and you're borrowing eventually and has a real economic consequences\nSo why don't the wise men around Donald Trump tell him about this like missed the call why don't they tell them that\nWell I understand the real world of politics and I understand that the politicians first job is just to get reelected ... that I Do not understand is don't these politicians have children don't they understand the world that they are creating for their children that's\nWhat I what what is that what is the world that's being created right now what will it looked like give us give us if there's a an economic a severe economic downturn and what does it look like\nWell I don't want to go as a as a volatiles riot but\nYou know you'll eventually reach a point where people have had enough\nAnd they're going to go there had been bread riots in history in our own country we had riots over food when we had the great depression newer riots people starving in this country\nWell I can tell you what's gonna happen probably in in ... in the short term is people don't understand how social she currently works\nThere is no real savings account and Social Security or money just goes into the general account and then when the benefits are paid it comes down to the general accounting right when Social Security was first started you had eleven people paying the benefits\nFor the one beneficiary now you have about two and a half people working to pay the benefits of the beneficiaries and one of the\nWhat what ... what about all the people faking disability on on the disability racket in America what about all the drug addicts about what about all the oxycontin addicts don't work who's paying for all of this we are the taxpayers\nIn our own country we had riots over food when we had the great depression there were riots people were starving in this country\n[noise] well I can tell you what's going to happen and probably in the short term is people don't understand how Social Security work\nThere is no real savings account and Social Security or the money just goes into the general account and then when the benefits are paying a comes out of the

oxycontin addicts don't work who's paying for all of this we are the tax payer that's\nTotally if you take a look at the statistics of who's actually paying taxes for the very interesting statistic about\nThem the ... the tax money where the the left is talking that they want the rich people to pay more taxes but if you look at the statistics the risk the top five percent\nAre paying more as a percentage of the federal tax revenue for paying more now than they did Twenty years ago\nThat's right and the top one percent and and the top one percent which is everybody in the media\nThey make no mistake about it all these wild left us during the top zero one percent are paying most of the taxes of the country that is if they're paying legitimately and I can't speak for anyone else I Will tell you right now I'm paying more taxes on the Trump tax plan that I did before at the you know that living in California\nWell let me tell you my\nTaxes went up in other words on the Donald Trump's so called tax plan as a Californian it doesn't matter that on a conservative or a libertarian whenever you wanted to find me I'd go try to find me I I Wish you good luck\nI'm paying more on the Donald Trump's tax plan that I did under Obama's did you know that yeah well what's really ... biggest and so it was everyone in New York even if their concern right wing because because you cannot deduct state taxes from federal anymore\nSince fifty percent of the population doesn't even work\nAnd another large percentage are illegal aliens who pay no taxes and people don't even care\nThe underground economy is so big right now people don't even know anything about these things but the so called tax plan that was supposed to be a great salvation for me as a Californian a is such that I'm paying more taxes than I did before did you know that does anyone who really you're not allowed to say anything about it oh hush hush don't say that\nAnyone in New York that what I'm Talking about any ...

deliberating a verdict will come out any time the city is bracing itself for this verdict\nUm there are companies all over the city or who were sent locked down a safety instructions\nBecause again I'm telling you the way this has been set up and you know how these things work look\nJust like the whole Brett Kavanaugh saying it should have nothing to do with the me too movement it should have nothing to do with\nUh all other women the only thing that the Brett Kavanaugh thing had to do with was did Brett Kavanaugh I'd do it did he do it it was about him and it was about Dr Ford's allegation this whole thing here\nI either a jury finds officer Van Dyke guilty of murder or they don't\nAnd we accept the verdict now you can protest till the cows come home but you know you know what's gonna happen if if for some reason officer Van Dyke is not found guilty of murder Chicago's gonna move well beyond protesting\nSkin to move into dangerous territory rioting and looting and the like let me go to Jim hate Jimmy\nBay and I'll take it one step further the studios every business owner at least a twenty four hour heads up the verdict there's rage and ask them to be announced at a specific time because we have to prepare our best officers but they don't get trashed birds and looted now\nAny up take it a step further and in short of first degree murder\nInvoluntary manslaughter

first of all um I could I screwed everybody knows what that is that were\nI Would explain it for audience\nYeah [laughter] well it's the sex counterpart a bit of a lift Audrey we're critter women

name it is an attack on any man in America that tries to make it and then what are your thoughts are if you can still spend about your books and I'm more folks you can get when you're concept during

sexist counterpart a list of a much larger than any other word hatred\nOf women hatred of men um and it's an ideology it's not just a an emotion that's not just a feeling it's a it's a a well thought out\nIdeology political ideology or what your past from one generation to attack the U.S still um and\nThis particular ideology uh\nComes directly out of Marxism\nUm although it has um the preachers also of 'em right wing ideologies sector is not system\nNamely that the evil is not so much I'm\nA class or an economic class in the marks distance but also um what amounts to a race or [noise] you know people were born with\nUm biological characteristics in this case um y chromosomes right\n[noise] so uh my colleague and I Katherine young who wrote these books with me [noise] um have spent about Thirty years looking at the various ah um\nCharacteristics of feminism as a political ideology now our field is religious studies and ah\nWhat we're interested in oh at least for was the ... of the ways in which political ideologies function as what we call secular religions in other words they have a they they can they um [noise]\nAllow people to have a sense of meaning and purpose in destiny they have moral code\nOr they have um [noise] ah they they can for identity [noise] um\nAnd they use very similar means they have ... events they have pilgrimages they have marchers in demonstrations and all these things really are rooted in a particular kind of religious ideology\nUm so that's the background um\nAnd what we find I'm going on today literally today a is a very disturbing I'm kind of\nI Would say religious revolution [noise] um the people who are um I'm not talking about ordinary people who could believe\n... either ... or for but the people behind the the movements to ah the people who are really spearheading me to for example of what this is all part\nUm they uh their ideology is\nBy now explicitly or a Revolutionary War may want to destroy one civilization or replace it with another\nUm and they began by describing a key institution of any society which is the family mhm ah so all of this is a going on not\nWould have religious revolution um the people who are\nUm I'm not talking about ordinary people who could believe either ... or Fort but the people behind the the movement the uh the people who are really spearheading me to for example of what this is all part um they\nOr their ideology is\nBy now explicitly or a revolutionary when they want to ... Roy one civilization or replace it with another um and they began by destroying a strict key institution\nOf any society which is the family mhm ah so all of this is a going on not felt much behind the scenes anymore you know when Catherine I began our research\nUm to find people actually outer ring or this kind of ideology or you had to look hard\nThey found ways of explaining it and getting around it and using all sorts of very elaborate um theories that metaphors and uh\nUm and they they they hid basically behind this phenomenon called post modernism right which in the academic world are sort of\nA bit has prevailed for about Thirty years um and give coverage to ideology basically post modern us they're saying that there is no such thing as truth there's only our recruits were there for\n'em and so all these things are are coming through a hat they're all out of a closet as it were um\nAnd no pun intended no pun intended [laughter] they're they're out there [laughter] right [laughter] ...\nHow people writing articles in the Washington Post for example called uh why can't we have been right now by cutting of overt miss angry was very\nUm where until about three or four

as a fact told him of all of us\nIt's really nothing new this happened in New England\nIn the sixteen forty era and tragically it's happening again\nAnd it's an example of the hysteria that is driving the political narrative today\nThe hysteria that began\nOn college campuses by a group of radical psychotic feminists\nKilling the patriarchy\nHas now a poison the entire body politic\nSo I'm going to ask you again holes in your opinion benefited most from the capital persecution\nNow many of you would think it's going to be a knee jerk reaction for me and said Republicans did\nBecause the base has been agitated by this\nI'm not so sure as a matter of fact\nI Know two very successful\nConservative women who've always been conservative not recently they didn't just recently voted for Trump they'd be conservative since they young youngsters and they're not happy with Kavanaugh would you believe that I was actually shocked to learn that\nThey don't like them they think he was angry I said what

angels I'll be gone there\nThey're practicing that warm ups\nWhat else appeared in Germany during that into war period\nHomosexual lesbian bar suddenly popped up and German cities I Know I'm not supposed to make a point of it but they did\nBut mainly in Berlin and by the sprays I got to keep 'em down on the farm after they've seen Berlin\nWell look at all the green haired girls at UC Berkeley er at Columbia\nThey all basically farm farm girls would come to the big city and suddenly they're wild and free\nMost Germans were shocked by this but then the leaders were not\nIn the past Germany had glorified motherhood and fatherhood\nAt a glorified mothers' duty to the father land\nBut said why my years glorified ramping sexuality free expression ... the accent of women\nAnd so the liberal why more government\nWas so akin to what we're having in America today\nAnd people felt good about it prostitution was criminalized drugs what wrapping laws against venereal disease were dropped\nJustice in America would dropping laws against using heroin now\nFirst they called an injection drug use now in San Francisco there actually giving junkies drugs to use can you believe this\nWhat else happened at a wine or a public\nThat is akin to what's happening in America today\nWeakens police authority\nRamping lawlessness arose because the liberal agenda led to weaken\nCriminals subtly proliferated\nCouldn't buy firearms\nPeople were not allowed to have firearms\nWell I can give you some more examples and then there was a backlash\nAnd people felt good about

authority\nRamping lawlessness arose because the liberal agenda led to weaken\nCriminals subtly proliferated\nCouldn't buy firearms\nPeople were not allowed to have firearms\nWell I can give you some more examples and then there was a backlash\nThat's what I'm Talking about the backlash said this liberalism arose right now for example it's a direct parallel to the ... Republican Germany and uh you have groups like on the far the Berman cowards are put on black masks\nBeat people up kicking girls in the street\nAttacking police breaking windows most of them are punks who go back to college teaching jobs or God Knows where they are\nWith impunity but we had the same thing that the world has seen the same thing in Germany and the into war period with the communist exactly the same thing you don't know that the brown shirts of Hitler we're we're a reaction to the lawlessness of the\nCommunist I don't think you understood this most people have it backwards now don't don't trust what I'm saying and Sam glorifying the brown shirts I Am simply giving you a piece of history and lessons for mystery remember when I said many times those that do not know history are condemned to repeat it I Am telling you it's showing\nWhat do you think I killed myself riding mass hysteria for\nBecause I'm trying to send out a warning to the world of where this will lead\nAnd I see what this really\nSo just like on the far today and the Occupy movements up today which are lawless and violent the analysis of today\nEgged on by Nancy Pelosi says we're all just raptors same thing there to the communist weren't given the green light\nTo attack anyone they wanted as they were attacking the Republicans now senators no one stops them it's as though we're powerless to protect ourselves from these where I'm at so and the Germans said enough is enough so what happened was a lot of ex military from World war one\nAlong with tremendous money from the aristocracy that was still in Germany\nThey had secret cells emerge\nAnd they put together some of the toughest men in Germany\nAnd they formed units coal brown shirts\nAnd they started beating of communist in the streets that's what happened I didn't say it should happen there don't condemn what I'm saying you don't want to know history you can be more on if you want you can be the biggest more on an earth but I Am going to tell you the story\nThey get to this story is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford it will buy stock mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next what worries me next\nThe brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc in Germany and the people cheered them\nYou know that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder\nAnd they shared the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute\nOf reality what I'm telling you\nMore on an earth but I Am going to tell you the story\nThey get to this story is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford it will buy stock mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next what worries me next\nThe brown shirts went out in the streets with

take the lawlessness and the disorder\nAnd they shared the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute\nOf reality what I'm telling you\nThe average person cheered on the brown shirts and some more men joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown shirts\nBut what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies\nAnd opposition from the right wing the larger a liberal society grows so grows with it the right wing that you and I said\nAnd so that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong Costa left with like you to think he's Hitler the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever imagine and so we had a little bit of a backlash we have a charismatic leader\nHe

additional background check was done by the FBI at the request of the Senate Judiciary committee and the president of the United states\nThey've looked at it and said yeah this was thorough and now at this point the Democrats are trying to come up with some other reason to delay the confirmation or we think Saturday morning by the Senate voting is going to vote to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nMy friend Andy McCarthy joins me now contributing editor at National Review and\nFormer federal prosecutor Andy good to have you back on I Want to get your take on on what's happened the last few days we've had the FBI do the traditional background checking and ... those who've read it say the report shows\nNothing new that would change our impression that was left after last Thursday's a testimony by both judge Kavanaugh and ... for\nWell thanks so much Lars there's nothing surprising about there being nothing new because\nThe allegations were obviously very thin and that's saying a more than they probably deserve so it's not surprising that there wasn't anything to collaborate them and it's not surprising to hear Democrats now complaining about the process\nRather than talking about the allegations because this has never been about anything other than the light you have forty nine\nDemocrats who do not want to have a fifth reliable conservative votes on the Supreme Court so what this has always been a bad is trying to push this beyond the midterms\nSo that the Democrats hope that they will take over the Senate and to defeat a cabin on the numbers the same way the Republicans were able to defeat\nMerrick Garland on the numbers all the rest of it as just hocus pocus to get to that point and the sad thing is that they didn't care about destroying a guy or in order to pull this off\nAnd in fact I think they vowed that even if he's confirmed they plan to try to impeach him but I I looked up the history there's only been one Supreme Court justice ever impeached isn't there\nThat's correct but\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand that this was transparently political and I doubt historically that it would count for much\nUsually Andy I ask you legal questions because your background is a federal prosecutor the guy with the blonde shake in prison for terrorism and handy by the way is the author of the grand jihad how Islam and the left her sabotaging America and he was a great example of it but let me ask you a political question do you think\nThat the Democrats by behaving in this way I mean it was actually referred\nTo as a demolition derby today\nThat it was a scorched earth policy that it was you know search and destroy mission was one of the descriptions I think John Cornyn throughout and Senator John Cornyn trout today\nDo you think that Americans average Americans who don't follow this closely as we do are going to look at this kind of behavior and be turned off by it to the point where they might change votes as full\nWell I think laws if you look at it as I understand it if you look at for example the\nThe polling that we're all looking so carefully at of the Senate races where you have these Democrats in red states Democrats in states that Trump won in in some places very decisively who are trying to hang on what we're seeing\nIs that there's been a shift in the sense that the party\nOut of power and in this case that the left with Trump and has been very animated and we're told you know very excited about the idea of of voting against\nTrump or sending a message to Trump in the midterms I think having overplay their hand with\nAh with with Kavanaugh what they've done is awake and\nThey usually more than a party in power for the midterms in mid term elections all all of that energy and enthusiasm so I think we're seeing some indication that what you describe exactly is what's going on and people looking at this and they're frightened by it\nAnd that means that that they miscalculated when they\nFirst calculated maybe we can take him out with an anonymous charge of the last minute that didn't work so we'll do a name to charge were Dr Ford's name\nHas come out Christine Ford and that didn't work so then we'll throw in a Debbie Ramirez which was even weaker case and then we'll throw in Julie sweating it which is by my read a gigantic mess because she's got\nAll kinds of of other baggage she brings weather and then as they did that\nAnd they started as you say to turn people off and and and both do that turn off Democrats and wake up Republicans and now I guess Heidi Heitkamp has come out and said she's going to vote against Kavanaugh\nAnd that might just not you might literally remover in North Dakota which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world because she's given her opponent a real boost\nYeah I think I think all of that is right and I think laws that it just goes to show what a monumental miscalculation they've made because I think with respect to professor for\nMost people even if they thought that she was wrong were of a mind to at least credit her good faith that you know was sincere or even if she was in ... not not particularly credible and I think by the time you get to sweat neck\nUm it's so preposterous people now look at it and where they were originally willing to credit people's good faith on the left they now see that this was a campaign as as Kavanaugh says it was it turn this whole\nIdea of advice and consent into search and destroy and they they were willing to destroy this guy's life destroy his family destroy his character over Supreme Court seat and I think people should lightly be frightened by that\nFunny all those Twenty years after the phrase the politics of personal destruction was use I think it will inappropriately to that trend\nThat she was wrong were of a mind to at least credit her good faith that Jim was sincere or even if she was not not particularly credible and I think by the time you get to sweat neck\nUm it's so preposterous people now look at it and where they were originally willing to credit people's good faith on the left they now see that this was a campaign as as Kavanaugh says it was it turned this whole\nIdea of advice and consent and just search and destroy and they they were willing to destroy this guy's life destroy his family destroy his character\nOver Supreme Court seat and I think people should lightly beat fight by that\nFunny all those Twenty years after the phrase\nThe politics of personal destruction was used I think it will inappropriately to best friend or a real a real creep and Bill Clinton or where you'll rape is somebody who really had done terrible things to women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat time of

well two out of the three undecided Republicans have already well they've looked through much of the report maybe not all of it and they have called the FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh and his

join the conversation welcome back to the Lars Larson Joe well we've heard some of the reaction from some of the Senate\nLeadership did say that they believe that all the Democrats are trying to do now is delay and delay and delay we've also heard that some of those who managed to read the investigation of quick additional background check that was done by the FBI at the request of the Senate Judiciary committee and the president of the United states\nThey've looked at it and said yeah this was thorough and now at this point the Democrats are trying to come up with some other reason to delay the confirmation or we think Saturday morning by the Senate voting is going to vote to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nMy friend Andy McCarthy joins me now contributing editor at National Review and\nFormer federal prosecutor Andy good to have you back on I Want to get your take on on what's happened the last few days we've had the FBI do the traditional background checking and ... those who've read it say the report shows\nNothing new that would change our impression that was left after last Thursday's a testimony by both judge Kavanaugh and ... for\nWell

been about anything other than the light you have forty nine\nDemocrats who do not want to have a shift reliable conservative votes on the Supreme Court so what this has always been about is trying to push this beyond the mid term\nThat would change our impression that was left after last Thursday's a testimony by both judge Kavanaugh and ...\nWill thanks so much Lars there's nothing surprising about there being nothing new because the allegations were obviously very thin\nAnd that's saying a more than they probably deserve so it's not surprising that there wasn't anything to collaborate them and it's not surprising to hear Democrats now complaining about the process\nRather than talking about the allegations because this has never been about anything other than the light you have forty nine\nDemocrats who do not want to have a theft reliable conservative votes on the Supreme Court so what this has always been a bad is trying to push this beyond the midterms\nSo that the Democrats hope that they will take over the Senate and can defeat a cabin on the numbers the same way the Republicans were able to defeat\nMerrick Garland on the numbers all the rest of it as just hocus pocus to get to that point and the sad thing is that they didn't care about destroying a guy in order to pull this off\nAnd in fact I think they vowed that even if he's confirmed they plan to try to impeach him but I I looked up the history there's only been one Supreme Court justice ever impeached isn't there\nThat's correct but you know I Am going to write about this for the weekend Lars but there's all kinds of norms that we've always relied on\nThat are no longer\nThe kind of norms that you can absolutely thank God I mean I Hope that's right and I hope that um that that we maintain the tradition that judges can't be a it can't be impeached\nUnless they've engaged in some kind of a misconduct or use their offices abuse simply by\nYou know there's all kinds of norms that we've we've had that are no longer\nYou know you you've had two or three generations of students\nWho've been told that norms are basically instruments of oppression that they that the establishment uses to keep them down and deny their desires and deny their policy solutions and the like and I I I just don't know how much we can rely on them anymore\nI just wonder because I've been to explain my audience and I think you back me up on those and told me if I'm wrong that if they attempted to an eight member court he would've effect to be effectively made a lot of the tightest decisions for foreign effectively and know it would've neutered the Supreme Court to a large extent\nBut could they get the same effect if they decide to try to introduce articles of impeachment against judge Kavanaugh\nAnd and by doing I Would still be able to function as a Supreme Court judge wild that nonsense was going on\nI think he would because he would just put his head down and continue\nTo do his job which is one of the reasons we should want him on the court I also think Lars as a practical matter the chance that Kavanaugh or any other Supreme Court justice is going to be removed is so remote\nOr as to be illusory that's not to say that you know like President Trump if the Democrat Scott ... majority in the house they couldn't impeach\nA sitting Supreme Court justice but the Senate would never remove them and everybody would understand that this was transparently\nPolitical and I doubt historically that it would count for months\nAndy I ask you legal questions because your background is a federal prosecutor the guy with the blonde shake in prison for terrorism and Andy by the way is the author of the grand jihad how Islam and the left or sabotaging America and he was a great example of it\nThe reasons we should want him\nOn the court I also think Lars as a practical matter the chance that Kavanaugh or any other Supreme Court justice is going to be removed is so remote or as to be illusory that's not to say that you know like President Trump\nIf the Democrat Scott ... majority in the house they couldn't impeach\nA sitting Supreme Court justice but the Senate would never remove them and everybody would understand that this was transparently\nPolitical and I doubt historically that it would count for months\nUsually Andy I ask you legal questions because your background is a federal prosecutor the guy put the blonde shake in prison for terrorism and Andy by the way is the author of the grand jihad how Islam and the left are sabotaging America and he was a great example of it but let me ask you a political question do you think\nThat the Democrats by behaving in this way I mean it was actually referred to as a demolition derby today\nThat it was a scorched earth policy that it was you know search and destroy mission was one of the descriptions I think John Cornyn throughout to Senator John Cornyn drought today\nDo you think that Americans average Americans who don't follow this closely as we do are going to look at this kind of behavior and be turned off by it to the point where they might change votes this full\nWell I think Laura is if you look at as I understand it if you look at for example the\nThe polling that we're all looking so carefully at of the Senate races where you have these Democrats in red states Democrats in states that Trump won in in some places very decisively who are trying to hang on what we're seeing\nIs that there's been a shift in the sense that the party out of power\nAnd in this case that the left with Trump and has been very animated and we're told you know very excited about the idea of of voting against Trump or sending a message to Trump in the midterms I think having overplay their hand with\nAh with with Kavanaugh what they've done is awake and\nThey usually more than a party in power for the midterms in mid term elections and all of that energy and enthusiasm so I think we're seeing some indication that what you describe exactly is what's going on and people are looking at this and they're frightened by it\nWell and that means that the they've miscalculated when they first calculated maybe we can take him out with an anonymous charge of the last minute that didn't work so we'll do a name to charge where Dr Ford's name\nHas come out Christine Ford and that didn't work so then we'll throw in a Debbie Ramirez which was an even weaker case and then we'll throw in Julie sweat Nick which is by my read a gigantic mess because she's got\nAll kinds of of other baggage she brings with her and then as they did that\nThey started as you say to turn people off and and and both do that turnout Democrats and wake up Republicans and now I guess Heidi Heitkamp is come out and said she's going to vote against Kavanaugh\nAnd that might just not you might literally remover in North Dakota which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world because she's given her opponent a real boost\nYeah I think I think all of that is right and I think lawyers it it just goes to show what a monumental miscalculation they've made because I think with respect to professor for\nMost people even if they thought that she was wrong were of a mind to at least credit her good faith that Jim was sincere or even if she was in ... not not particularly credible and I think by the time you get to sweat neck\nUm it's so preposterous people now look at it and where they were originally\nPeople often and and both do that turnout Democrats and wake up Republicans and now I guess Heidi Heitkamp is come out and said she's going to vote against Kavanaugh and that might just not you might literally remover in North Dakota which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world because she's given her opponent a real boost\nYeah I think I think all of that is right and I think lawyers that it just goes to show what a monumental miscalculation they've made because I think with respect to professor for\nMost people even if they thought that she was wrong were of a mind to at least credit or good faith that you know was sincere or even if she was not not particularly credible and I think by the time you get just sweat neck\nUm it's so preposterous people now look at it and where they were originally willing to credit people's good faith on the left they now see that this was a campaign as as Kavanaugh says it was it turned this whole\nIdea of advice and consent into search and destroy and they they were willing to destroy this guy's life destroy his family destroy his character\nOver Supreme Court seat and I think people should lightly beat fight by that\nIs funny all those Twenty years after the\nPhrase the politics of personal destruction was used\nWhat was that again what Donald Trump needed the votes to get a Senate confirmation for lighter Republican so he was forced to do that until\nAbout ... what what more did the you know that what more did the FBI need as Dr ...\n... where you can ask her to follow up questions a\nCrush on a long time what you don't want to know the location you could ask questions about it we had this kind of ... so what do you really don't have the I Can't\nTell over me Jerry I'm trying to be reason I'm going to keep my question short you keep your answer short\nShe was asked Dan where this happened she doesn't know where it happened you know when it happened or even what year it happened and she's not sure about any of that do you think of the FBI sat there and send its best aging in and said ask her again you know where that is the answer would change\nThe past so she knows more information and that's how I don't know if the north and she stayed at so we're we're pretty close we actually\nThere are questions like where exactly what time of place did this happen what time of year and the Republicans cut short questionable by that he loved us like why didn't the Republicans\nEven hold on hold on a jury Larry I don't like it when you ...\nHold on a jury of your life ... you know over ... jury ... I'm trying to be reason I'm going to keep my question ... you keep ... short\nShe was asked you know where this happened she doesn't know where it happened you know when it happened or even ... you were to happen and she's not sure about any of that do you think of the FBI sat there and send its best age and ended ... ask her again you know where this answer would change\nThe actually she knows more information than that how do you know ... to the north and she stayed at so we're we're pretty close we actually there\nWere questions are getting where exactly what time of please give us happened what time of year and the Republicans cut short the questioning by that he left us to do they brought in the Republicans\nCould you hold on hold on a jury Gary Hart and when you miss the facts the Republicans got five minutes at a time and they turned their time over to the professional sex crimes investigator for the Democrats each each of the questions on the panel got five minutes of the time they got exactly the same amount of time\nAnd and one of them spend all his time asking about sports and and about uh about what ... flying was in high school uh you know and what devil's triangle was which turns out to be drinking game just as he said so when you say the Democrats didn't have time to ask her word happen\nShe's been very clear and all the things you said ... her letter to find science in her testimony under oath to the Senate committee she doesn't know where it happened a jury\nYou realize how ridiculous ... say you've only the FBI had asked that question for five more times her answer might have changed let's go to another nice here now that's what we call my wife when the grandbabies around now welcome to the program\nAh high ...

did\nHe ... and I didn't I mean he hasn't been in politics she's been on the bench as a judge and it it operates a whole different way than what that hearing to the other day and the second thing is

Maltese for both men and women guess what you get\nUm and have but they have about a quarter the amount of elder very because as I say if you put the one point five grams of elderly concentrate on the gummy they'd be ... you know it'd be just too much um moisture content and they would hold their shape but it's a great option for kids their dose for children\nSo as the syrup you know for kids Thirteen and under they just take half of the adult do so these are really nice to be able to\nUse for the whole family\nAnd a half his age so I've actually already started taking these very immune ... my kids um and I love the fact that they're not too sweet 'cause I Know that some of the Disney taste really nice because they've got lots of sugar on them but I Know that they're not good for me either so I Love that you guys really kept the sugar content low in these\nWe do in fact we don't add any sugar what makes them we the only thing that makes them sweet is the fruit an apple puree that makes up the gummy so this is like grandma's old fashioned fruit whether these are not glucose\nSyrup gummy is Cain syrup gummy as tapioca certain companies these companies have\nA only apple and peach puree tapioca fiber apple and orange still packed and and that's what holds them together and they've got all the nutrients in them it's the same as the multivitamin gummy as we actually have to make them in Germany right now because nobody in the United states would manufacturing companies without cornstarch\nAnd so to get a guy that's made with only organic sunflower oil and then dusted and rice flower just to keep them from sticking together in the bottle\nWe had to find that we found this candy manufacturer confectionery and Germany that I'm just\nDoes things and that drove by the way they've got like a loop crew set type of mold was the ceramic lining and they use sunflower oil and rice flour\nAnd um and and so we've had to go to great lengths to get them made the way that we wanted them made\nWhile I Want to tell you that they'd been flying off the shelf we've only got a couple of them left and God Knows you know I\nI don't bring more bring more um but um we should we should we like to start taking like an everyday thing or should we just take it when we're starting to feel under the weather would what would you\nWell that's that's a great question I you know when we launched this line of course I had to go back and research all the herbs and and get refreshed on you know what they were all about and we all think of ... is being anti\nViral and I think a lot of times you reach for it when you have an upper respiratory tract infection and a cold or flu or for that reason\nAnd and while it's true that elder berry has been shown to be effective against a lot of the known flu strains and it's a really good bet you know if you're trying to decide vaccine or older Barry I'm I'm like I'm On the older very camp but uh what\nYou know maybe it's gone to a bacterial infection you get a sign of a little respiratory thing and then it goes to a sinus infection that's usually bacteria and oregano oil is great for that um so it's a really nice delivery system with a lot of uh servings I think that of six drop surveying and each bottle has\nTwo hundred servings so it's an amazing value but I Would remind people about oregano is that\nIt is an essential oil which means that the yield is very low meaning that you you get to use a lot of plant material to get a little bit of a central oil and think about those little half ounce bottles of a central oil it begs probably nine to eleven pounds of oregano leaves to make one half ounce bottle of central oil\nI just always try to remind people how potent this stuff is this is the defense system of the plant that you are using to your body's benefits and you don't need a lot\nRight a little bit colds a long way now how long long way you'd be yeah how long should you be taking oil of ... you know like on every day or when you're coming down with something you take it like three times a day or what would you recommend\nWell I mean I I think it's each person system is going to be differently sensitive ... well it does have antibacterial activity which means that it can disrupt your microbiomes so if you take the first six drops and you'll find that your God is roiling a little better you get a little bit of loose stool\nYou know you realize that it is disrupting your microbiomes so you may need to pair it with a with a probiotic for example\nAnd then um [noise] if you if you\nTake it for too long again it it it can be a disruptor to the micro biome so it's not a good idea to stay on it super long term you stay on it well you need it\nThen you take a break and keep up on your ... robotics and ... and restore you know the micro biome I I I feel that oregano oil ding us ... does it is it's just not something someone to say oh I'd take it every day it's so different to grind or or great or cutting sift\nSome fresh are dried oregano onto your food it's a whole different potency\nOh thank you for clarifying that number 'cause we just these questions everyday in the store so it's nice to you know what to um give them as an answer [noise]\nYeah and so we just had a listener call in and had a question for you um you know we were talking about the oil of oregano helping with bacteria and things now would that be helpful for someone with a I'm a huge by a Yunior tract infection or other infections like that\nYeah I mean I Know that people have tried to use it that way it's I think it's fairly non specific you know we know that cranberries really good against ... which is about\nPercent or two thirds maybe of all your tract infections um clubs yellow we know that ... has more specific for that the suit amount as is another one um you know ... kind of be a broad spectrum benefits okay um but realize that I'm\nJust with a central is I think about how the volatile compounds and how do you take it orally most of its effect is going to be\nA fairly local it's going to know it can really get into mucus membranes very easily like just as your swallowing it and and the guy\nUm I I don't know how much of it will make it into the bladder where it would have an effect on on bacteria but overall it does help immunity and I think that's what we forget it it's not just an on contact anti microbial it actually\nHas you know as all antioxidants do an ability to stimulate your own cellular defense mechanisms and so the heart of what a reading book does is to improve your overall immune\nAwareness your system kind of says wait a second we're sleeping we need to put out sometimes I mean to put out some you\nJust with a central is I think about how the volatile compounds and how do you take it orally most of it's the fact is going to be\nA fairly local it's going to know it can really get into mucus membranes very easily like just as your swallowing it and and the guy um\nI I don't know how much of it will make it into the bladder where it would have an effect on on bacteria but overall it does help immunity and I think that's what we forget it it's not just an on contact anti microbial it actually\nHas you know as all antioxidants do an ability to stimulate your own cellular defense mechanisms and so the heart of what a ... does is to improve your overall immune\nAwareness your system kind of said wait a second we're sleeping we need to put out sometimes I Need to put out some you know any accidents mean to put out some defense mechanisms here and see what's going on\nSo it kind of draws draws everybody's attention to the fact that they need to pay it needs to pay attention to something\nGot it so you know seeing as you're saying it can provide them a little bit or caused them to make you know irritation maybe is it something you could put on topic we then\nThat definitely definitely um I I I I like it and it's already on an olive oil so it can certainly be used on something that needs a little anti microbial protection topic Li yep even things where you get 'em\nYou know rashes or irritation there ... or psoriasis but the secondary infection of as a as a risk mhm\nSo you can do you know wherever you know ... something but it can get infected that you could use it and and the fact that it's already diluted it makes a nice little almost like a stop\nAnd I'd like to tell everyone to that my kinds organic from garden of life with the oil of recognition is organic so I always look for that feel and there was that seal of approval right on that box so it is organic so thank you for doing that amber so in\n... it's I think it's just so important so amazing\nAnd you touched a little bit about sleeping and you also have a really good formula that just came out and it's called sleep well because as you know when we're sick and under the weather or we need to get arrested in our sleep and sometimes when we were coughing and

seven this is not securities we're not talking the stock market there's crypto currency\nIt's regulated under IRS code for real estate anybody can do this over here you don't need a license with that said I'm not out there given advice either I'm telling you what I Do\nAnd and then I'm just telling the stories of what goes on with crypto currency but I'm Talking with a young man this morning about a trade fifty thousand dollar trite and I'm encouraging I'm always encouraging now listen here's been my philosophy for years you buy and you put your for dinner on\nYou do a little bit of maintenance but you're always putting your forget her on it's just like owning a home any body that's their own home and I've known plenty of them\nYou own a home you put your forget her on and say I'm going to live in this house for ten twenty thirty forty years for me I don't like to stay in them that long but let's say you're going to buy a house and you make a decision I'm going to have it for Thirty years okay while your kids are growing in may be going through college this honey\nOr wherever your partner is there say honey\nMaybe you're by yourself single parent I'm going to live in this house when I raised my kids wait till they get out of college before I even think are moving to I just want to keep steady that let's say that your thought gang during that\nThirty years have you put in for your forget around you're still going to mow the lawn paint the fence maybe New Rochelle new air conditioner maybe a little addition on maybe do a little remodeling on the inside new bathroom tile new carpet new kitchen new cabinet maybe your garage\nYou get the point maybe going to put it in a a seeming driveway\nMaybe going to put it in some flowers in the tree you get the point right there's always some maintenance there's always something maybe the washer and dryer glad that you get a new and maybe the water heater goes I gotta get new and maybe have some electrical problems are floods and he got to fix it there's always some maintenance that goes along with it the same way in our\nInvesting are buying over here and crypto world I'm just talking crypto\nBut I've always done that for just my personal cell\nYou always have to maintain what we have it always had help stamp professional help I have a professional broker as well as myself can't now\nWhich has to have some kind of maintenance goes on in there but you have the savings account and I've been really big on the savings account I'm not broke\nJust freak so you know I'm debt free personally debt free and I'm not broke\nAnd when I work with somebody I don't want them to be in debt I Want to know their background was called K. why I say this is one of the things why crypto currency is working so well and why people are making so much money why because you have to know your customer\nThe exchanges want to know who you are they ask you all kinds of questions\nThey open up the wallet they wanted\nWhat we have it always has help stamp professional help I have a professional broker as well as myself game now\nAlways has to have some kind of maintenance goes on in there but you have the savings account and I've been really big on a savings account I'm not broke\nJust freak so you know I'm debt free personally debt free and I'm not broke\nAnd when I work with somebody I don't want them to be in debt I Want to know the background it's called ... where I see this is one of the things why crypto currency is working so well and why people are making so much money why because you have to know your customers\nThe exchanges want to know who you are they ask you all kinds of questions\nThey open up the wallet they want to know where you're coming from what you're doing with the money they want to know and you have to tell him all the wise you don't get on and it's always helpful if you're truthful K that for the average Joe the average Jane who wants to leverage themselves and be leverage Joan LeBron James\nAnyway\nYou got to know what you're doing or wherever there's so much that can be made why would I leave money in a savings account I'm not against the banks I'm for them\nEspecially because they put a trillion and a half dollars one trillion six hundred billion into the block chain just this year alone to get it ready to roll out I'm telling you is coming faster than what you and that's why you want [laughter] a dog and the guy yesterday I said how about having a tear up by a money\nHe's an engineer he can understand that and then when I was\nTalking to this morning again to somebody else a young person young they're not even close to retirement age they're thirty some odd years away as it could you imagine having a ... by a killer by er at Terre by full of money\nIn their eyes lit up and they literally could couldn't talk they're like ... ... [laughter] I'm not making fun of them I'm just saying they could not like could not concentrate after that could not take\nA tear up by the money online money's digits\nBase the mascot American Express your debit cards it's all digits has nothing to do with the ah it's just digits on line okay this is the evolution of it so let's get back to the savings account you have your long term is how I laid out\nAnd I got a couple of extra time not going to talk about but long term\nThen you have your utilities your basic overhead food electricity et cetera what it would cost you to live then I have my payroll account\nThen I have my short term expense account that's for expendable\nFor you know stuff that I really want to get it's not in the budget and then I make a decision do I really want it can't afford it yeah well I got the little savings account for it and then I got my charity account I got a couple of more I'm not going to mention those but I got my charity care and that's the give because they don't want to give\nDo I see somebody and I go I Do not want to give them one penny\nBut I Know that God commands me\n... very careful here because I don't want to make got out of the liar in my life I Know God commands me to give\nWe're we have to I'm commanded by it and I'm commissioned to go out and do that so I have this little account even though I don't want to do it I Do it because I'm command in and on commission to do it\nEither if you\nFor you know stuff that I really want to get it's not in the budget and then I make a decision do I really want it can't afford it yeah well I got the little savings account for it and then I got my charity account I got a couple of more I'm not going to mention those but I got my charity care and that's the give because they don't want to give\nMy seat somebody and I go I Do not want to give them\nOne penny but I Know that God commands me\n... very careful here because I don't want to make got out of the liar in my life I Know God commands me to give\nWe're we have to um commanded by it and I'm commissioned to go out and do that so I have this little account even though I don't want to do it I Do it because I'm command in and on commission to do it\nEither\nIf you even get close to half of these little accounts like I have\nYou will be financially or set for three lifetimes like I Am I live in those of you know me and I've had a PIN house I would very nice homes and I've lived in the ghetto\n... as we lived in the penthouse we had houses in the ghetto we love the houses in the ghetto the people that we lived around were the salt of the great neighbors\nI'm Still friends with some of 'em over there I'm just trying to tell you is what you make your home wherever your home is going to be right paint houses to beg she wanted to be there but what I'm trying to say to you is if you live within your means\nI live well below my means and I have enough to live if something happens to me okay now listen so that's why you have those savings account but you have the savings account you take it I put it over into crypto that's how I started I put a little bit over here that's not really how I started I started by giving somebody some money [laughter]\nHe was mining will go from there that's another story but I took a little started\nAnd then went from there and I started trading old market gift wow look at that let's buy some more and then when it went up I said oh we went up\nI'm going to sell half of it and then took my profit because why it's not profit unless you have in your hand so I took my profits and I've set that aside and I put it in some of my little accounts there\nAnd build those up\nAnd then I took the money that I had plus some of the profits I left it\nAnd then I seen the dip again I go I think it's a good time to buy now there's a percentage of it that you leave and put your forget her on forever you just don't touch it\nBut if you're paying attention I mean if you're spending [laughter] if you're spending more than one hour a day watching TV or doing extra curricular activities outside of your work\nThen a person in my opinion should at least band\nHour on their financial future it's just a good rule of thumb I also believe in the mornings in the mornings I get up I expand once again I don't want him I got out a liar so when I talk about my higher power God\nGame I don't want to ever to make got out to be a liar because why because we're representative like live stream church over there they were so kind to me in in compound the other day\nFinancial future it's just a good rule of thumb I also believe in the mornings in the mornings I get up my band once again I don't want to make got out of liars when I talk about my higher power God\nGame I don't want to ever to make got out to be a liar because why because we're representative like life's dream charge over there they were so kind to me in in compound the other day\nEquals one point one one zero two to three e to the tenth\nPower of a ... that's how many ... are in one million bit and so the the engineer and I was talking to last night said\nI didn't even know that there was a pet or

Virginia now beat Notre Dame now I Am yeah now I understand it again I'm going to take them yeah I I taught her name's Luke\nLegit I mean I watch them play oh there are a jet they out Stanford Stanford last we should go\nThere they they were physical uh listen I didn't know they had that much team speed that they know the quarterback has shifted the running back as powerful in strong they got long white ride receivers it's very [noise]\nYeah I don't I don't think Notre Dame offensively has been this loaded in quite some time while I'm\nI'm Still going to call the upset or trapped game you know I I I just see that something in Virginia Tech strong down there all day\nYeah there's very rockets crowd but yeah you got a couple of scores on me take them out of the game and I think Notre Dame can do that are there the better team I think over the course of sixty minutes or you know everything we're\nNotre Dame scores personal shut the crowd up because that that happens down there yeah ... how about washing UCLA or UC apostle are set for you in a way I don't either I think\nWe're only going to war with our lives in Washington is on a mission after losing to Auburn they're going to crush everybody they got a tough uh they've got to play organ they got to play Stanford so they'll they'll look past UCLA but it's not going to matter 'cause UCLA just doesn't have the talent\nAnd I think they'll just ... I don't know I I'm just for some reason I like these kinda games because this next one I liked to Utah in Stanford I I just sat ...\nNo no no Stanford yeah at last week's game I feel sorry for Utah that's all I can say writes love is going to be healthy\nYeah yeah yeah it it's going to be a good way to find getting a staffer how about ... ... a couple of years ago we we kept talking about McCaffrey Chris yeah average wonderful he is doing the lights out he's just a lifetime run around at\nFifteen pounds he knows ... God given ability he's just a great utility player he's getting more touches now yeah he is and and that's that's what I wanted to talk about one more game mature to rank teams the red river shootout as yeah ... yeah Texas is a little big for their bread just\nI I'm just for some reason I like these kinda games because it's next what I like to Utah in Stamford\nI I just ... no no no Stanford yeah last week game I feel sorry for Utah that's all I can say ... love is going to be healthy\nYeah yeah yeah it it's going to be but it could be if I get a staffer how about ... ... a couple of years ago we we kept talking about McCaffrey\n... wonderful he is doing the lights out he's just light some run around fifty pounds he knows ... God given ability he's just a great utility player he's getting more touches now yeah he is and and and that's that's what I wanted to talk about one more game mature to rank teams\nThe red river shootout as yeah ... yeah Texas is a little big for their bridges\nI don't know about Aaron Rodgers one good hit nice guy I really believe\nThat he doesn't let you listen run the ball to Montgomery they've got guys he's got a good tight in and out one thing that he likes to me I mean grant\nBack there but now see I think the absence of Jodie Nelson still has an effect although it's a joy as Congress dropping all kinds of ...\nWe didn't have you guys did have Kennedy golladay you wouldn't even have a wind up no kidding they miss Shorty yeah that's the way it is over there and Roger is the best quarterback in the league is going to find a way to win and and that's what they'll do once on as what\nHe won't do that But Matthew staffer also find a way to win but we need to use carry on jobs and running back more we ... we get it wrong guy he could have done a lot more against Allison than even though it was a field goal that we lost by all that long ago a profit was the jets the Broncos better walk over these guys because that just the I mean that Broncos de will destroy them\nYeah here's the deal I said this before when they travel to Baltimore if you've got an early kick and you're traveling back he's the Broncos historically played bad the last time I think it was two or three years ago they went up to what they want us to Jersey and they did they did beat the jets who was really ugly but I think to leave out of late a interception or something okay\nYeah Denver can go up there if they play as well as they did a on Monday Night they should have no problem with the New York ... that was a good\nGame Monday Night then what really was a good game I Swear to God uh well let's go here's an interesting playing a game you had the Jacksonville Jaguars going to Kansas City go arrowhead stadium yeah and it costs about ... the role of a lifetime and it comes to an end on Sunday and I believe that too I think the jags would it be Kansas City\nJacksonville defense is is finding defenses we've seen in the last few few every position they're solid accolades gamble they got to all pros on the wings linebackers they got tough guys I mean they're really really good now Denver only had one sack homes but they rushed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow is getting his touches a Drew Brees what can you say the hall of famer yeah a little such back to their defense they show up whenever they want um\nYou would think that they've got to make some adjustments because they give up a lot of points I mean it takes a lot of games where they give up a lot of ... yeah it it it's exciting to watch\nUh for the game of football but if you're a stage than probably just grabbing your at every you know between the fourth quarter in the in the game because you just don't know what's gonna happen but I don't think I don't think Washington has the firepower to hang with them so I I don't uh New Orleans at home\nI I Would do it in the way they score points or last year when when the stakes are playing the lions and we were down by by thirty now\nWe're down by more than we're down like forty points and we were coming back and coming back and I was at heart failure and coming back and I still think the Detroit Lions played for any blood pressure medicine I Will ever need in my life and uh but do you well yeah because he comes back he keeps coming at\nA listen you're to raise your team as the talent uh\nI think I don't know why they but I like to say I think they're going to be fine I really do I I Would only coach for four games right listen they got a tough schedule you do you know they they looked great against New England and I know there was reason behind that but they somehow have to formulate that every week\nDoes he want to think like he's playing belly checked every week good well then instill that in your players are like ... and I get that offensive coordinator to get to to just cut loose a little bit so safe they just played differently and you could see it and they had success with that business model so why not use that as a week\nOr two you were mentioning coaches earlier map Patricia is totally different the gym called law you know as far as ...\nWell I had a more liberal and he's ... he's a lot moody or a ... he's a player's coach I think that they get matched Patricia they really\nDo I think they really liked them up there we'll see what happens on all that and we're going to go to break will be coming up and I'll tell you what and our final break we got first friday yeah at ... has a wonderful what we both have really\nGood I got to ... and then I've got a great one I found out about it about a month ago and I'm just going to rave about so\nCool and we got some really good

Andrew in his ability with words so that I Can't I Can't wait to see that for for that reason also\nYes well when I read Andrew script that's when I knew that I wanted to do it there's one scene in particular where God's nails defense attorney who's played by my favorite actor I'm In the defense attorney as cross examining a\nKind of a good abortion doctor Iran's very clean\nUp in a clinic or prosecution calls in order to contrast what she did with white guys no good at what God's nails attorney does is take her through the steps of what actually occurs in an abortion procedure and when I read that part of the script I just was like\nI didn't know any of this I did not know that this is how how it was done I didn't know I didn't know the laws about what makes that one legal and what makes what does no good illegal and when I read that I was just like this is information that\nI think everybody should know no matter what side of the issues are on this information hurt anybody you need to know and so that's uh that's one of the great things about it in the script is there's so much in it\nThat the people on either side of the issues and you can can can learn from\nYeah the ... and I and that is I ... I heard that from 'em and macaroni and failing Mackler who the producers of the some friends of ours as well and I remember talking with them about that when they were going to his trial and the they were in that courtroom and in hearing all of this\nUm and it really I mean obviously it it sparks something with and then to make sure that the story was not just told that accurately told\nAnd I just I Love the care that you and everyone had had taken because it with a film like this it would be so easy you know for for your contemporaries to say oh my gosh this is going to be a very ...\nVery political film there's no way but it isn't I mean it's just a as you were saying there you know we're in this this information can't hurt you\nThings that happened and and what was ... and why it was illegal this stuff that people should know\nAnd there were actual women in this that we're in this guy's care who lost their lives and who really suffered and they should get justice especially in the era of believe women and and it female empowerment you wouldn't want that story told and you would want to know how\nThis man particularly preyed on poor and disadvantaged women to enriching himself\nAnd and why it was allowed to go on I mean the fear in the political climate of the time back then cause them to to not inspectors Clinton for Seventeen years\nThe building or Pennsylvania is a time was a man named Tom Ridge and the Philadelphia or Pennsylvania or to health said that they did not expect\n... can't hurt you things that happened and what was ... why it was illegal stuff that people should know\nAnd there were actual women in this that we're in this guy's care who lost their lives and who really suffered and they should get justice especially in the era of believe women

still do harm in Pennsylvania ... fell\nSaid that they did not expect guys milk when it for that period of time because they got orders from the governor's job is not to inspect abortion clinics

in friends I Do know though that if I couldn't afford a doctor\nOr a garage I'm not going to be buying or leasing a Porsche or a yacht [noise]\n[noise] well getting back to you know here's some more conventional wisdom says you bring the man on a mission to retire America One version at a time when you go\nBack to the radio show today I'm going to share with you six reasons that real estate out performs other investments um any one of the six could be as good as some other investment\nBut the fact that this has all six of them at the same time makes it undeniably the most profitable investment you could possibly may so we're going to cover this through the show if you want to follow along the start with the first thing that most investments cannot do and that is called captured equity\nWhat does that mean that means I go out there and because of the market is so\nImperfect is the term I'd like to use\nIt's very easy to find situations where you can buy something below what its value is simply by below what its value is so you've got a guy and the gal out here the want to sell their home a holds out real good shape so it doesn't really qualify for Fannie Mae loan and let's say that the home is worth\nTwo hundred thousand dollars but there's ten thousand dollars with the repairs need to be made before Fannie made with lead on the home so you would think you'd bought a house for one Ninety but that's just not how it happens what happens is we go out there and we buy that house for a hundred and fifty a hundred and sixty thousand dollars\nAnd so we capture forty thousand dollars of equity\nCalled is captured equity now think about what that would mean let's say you go to the stock market and say I want to buy IBM stock or you want to buy Microsoft stock and you say okay I wouldn't buy two hundred thousand dollars worth of Microsoft stock what are you going to pay for this\nSo you've got a guy and the gal out here the want to sell their home or homes not real good shape so it doesn't really qualify for Fannie Mae loan and let's say that the home is worth\nTwo hundred thousand dollars but there's ten thousand dollars with the repairs need to be made before Fannie made with land on the home so you'd think you'd buy the house for one Ninety but that's just not how it happens what happens is we go out there and we buy that house for a hundred and fifty a hundred and sixty thousand dollars\nAnd so we capture forty thousand dollars of equity\nWe call this captured equity\nNow think about what that would mean let's say you go to the stock market and say I want to buy IBM stock or you wanna buy Microsoft stock and you say okay I Want to buy two hundred thousand dollars with the Microsoft stock what are you going to pay for this\nYou're going to pay two hundred thousand so go to your stockbroker and go no no no what I Want to do is I Want to buy two hundred thousand dollars worth of IBM stock and only pay a hundred and sixty thousand dollars for\nA new stockbrokers in looking at you like you're insane you're out in your mind it can't be done\nBecause they can't and any other investment that gets traded in open trading market that can't be done now you could do this if you buy used cars you can go out there by the causes for a ten thousandth the guy that owns it doesn't do that or needs money so bad is willing to sell cheap for three thousand\nBecause maybe it needs some repairs and he doesn't have the money to do the repairs that would be the same story of the house maybe you know even though the repairs only costs ten thousand maybe they don't have ten thousand that's why they're selling they're forced to sell and they're forced to sell below what is truly worth\nNet net net of the repairs necessary to do it so we're able to buy this capture equity well what kind of returns can you make a ... that's what really blows your mind\nLet's say for instance that we go out here and we buy a house and\nA two hundred thousand dollar house most two hundred thousand some real round numbers for radios easier we'd go buy a hundred thousand dollar house and we buy it for let's say sixty thousand dollars well we had to lenders they'll will end is up to eighty percent of after repaired value\nSo at the house is worth a hundred thousand after you repair it and do ten thousand dollars with the repairs and we can buy for sixty they will lend us up to eighty thousand dollars but they won't lend us up to eighty unless it's actually going to have that much in it so if we bought it for sixty do tend to repairs they would only lend to Seventy\nJust enough to buy it and do the repair so we'd have no money in the deal so what is that captured game which is thirty thousand dollars\nThat's a infinity number to put a dollar and say we invested a dollar into the deal we've now got a thirty thousand percent return\nRight it's just unbelievable now let's say that we had to twenty thousand rehab and we break even again now we have\nA we're in for eighty it's worth a hundred we make twenty thousand we make twenty thousand on his zero investment was put in a dollar and now we have a twenty thousand percent return you're not seeing anything like that go to the stock market you know I Want to buy stock\nAnd have you lend me all the money to buy it now that there are margins cows by the way there is such a thing uh but I think that they only lend up to Seventy five percent is what they do but the point is it's Seventy five percent\nAnd you have to put the other twenty five percent down you have to put that money and now let's talk about this house let's say for instance it's more of\nA less aggressive deal a um lower property elicit were buying a hundred thousand dollar house for eighty and we'll put ten and to make it worth Ninety it's worth a hundred after repaired value so\nNow we have a we're in for eighty\nIt's worth a hundred we make twenty thousand we make twenty thousand on zero investment was put in a dollar and now we have a twenty thousand percent return you're not seeing anything like that go to the stock market you know I Want to buy stock\nAnd have you lend me all the money to buy it now that there are margins cows by the way there is such a thing uh but I think that they only land up to Seventy five percent is what they do but the point is it's Seventy five percent\nAnd you have to put the other twenty five percent down you have to put that money and now let's talk about this house let's say for instance it's more of\nA less aggressive deal a um lower property elicit were buying a hundred thousand dollar house for eighty\nAnd we'll put ten and to make it worth Ninety\nIt's worth a hundred after repaired value so now we make ten thousand bucks ten thousand dollars on what well if we put ten percent down which would be ten thousand dollars that's a hundred percent return nothing about making a hundred percent return\nThe moment you by the piece of real estate now if we had to put twenty percent down that it would be a fifty percent return so would you go to your stock market and you guys a refiners play go I Want to buy something today\nThat I can buy\nFor eighty thousand dollars that's worth a hundred thousand dollars is the first of all he doesn't have that but let's say he could and shape but then I don't want to put\nAnything down\nWell we can't do that so let's say you have to put the twenty thousand down so okay I'm willing to put down ten percent twenty percent sort of twenty thousand dollars down to make it twenty thousand dollar instant gain\nThat's captured equity\nThat's a hundred percent return those guys you got to think about that so how does anybody any investment compete with a hundred percent return\nThe day you buy it that's got to think you just can't fathom it's the difference between the kind of money we make is real estate investors and the kind of money that you don't make\nAs not being a real estate investor and nobody even understand so they don't even get it it's not even brought up you never hear your financial planner ask you um as we get into some deals today would you like some instead games\nRight how would you like to capture some instant games to day there's no such\nThing they're not telling you that you find it put listen listen to me on the radio think cuckoo for cocoa puffs and then go talk to a financial planner and ask them to do for you what I'm telling you we do on a regular basis\nAnd see the guy can't even understand what you're talking about if he knew he could make a hundred percent return keep you out there making but he doesn't believe it 'cause he doesn't understand it and he can't do it that's the difference\nSo we started I'm gonna write that down here just for making no to myself no to self one hundred percent return captured act but if it's only fifty percent that's still pretty cool or it was only twenty five percent that's what we call what if it's infinity that's unbelievable right\nIf it's in the city\nNow we're starting to compare that to the stuff that you've got stock market goes up ten percent a year twelve percent\nYour wow that's a year and it's only ten percent this instantly as a hundred percent because there's not even close so as we look at the situation we're beating everything that you are going to do for the rest of your life\nCaptured it would've been only fifty percent it's still pretty cool what it was only twenty five percent that's what we would have been in the entity that's unbelievable right it's a city\nThat we're starting to compare that to the stuff that you got stock market goes up ... percent a year twelve percent of your wow\nThat is a year and it's only ten percent this just instantly as a hundred percent because it's not even close so as we look at the situation\nWe're reading everything that you were going to do for the rest of your life\nFive percent yes it's five percent higher return but percentage return increase is three hundred percent wouldn't you like to increase your profitability by three hundred percent\nVery simple getting the real estate get away from all these other investments you rent because real estate pays those kinds of the evidence now\nHave the time with this something that is really the six benefit but I Want to make it clear that this six benefit spread out and multiple different ways across each different benefits across the different games and that is tax wise\nIf you earn money from a CD or a money market account or a savings account or stocks that dip it in is taxable as ordinary income\nSo let's say you make\nTwo percent of that savings account you lose thirty percent of that now you down to one point see that'd be six off at one point four percent\nRight let's say you make four percent in stock devotees Nineteen thirty percent off of that and thirty percent of for seven and it's going to take you down to two point one to point two percent\nRight that's that's what happens which would taxation and so when you look at that\nThe spread in return is even larger because of the tax consequences of the way real estate gets taxed compared to other income and the way they get tax so you just you can see that to understand what it's all about so\nI said it's all the time how is it investment if there is a cash how is there an investment if it isn't cash thinking about that how was your investment if there isn't cash\n... now thinking about this also if you own a piece of real estate and you're on some stocks and the stocks go down you haven't lost anything but you haven't gained anything if you own a piece of real estate in the market shifts and the market\nTaxation and so when you look at that\nThe spread in return is even larger because of the tax consequences of the way real estate gets taxed compared to other income and the way they get tax so you just you can see that to understand what it's all about so I said it's all the time\nHow is it investment if there isn't cash how is there an investment if it isn't cash thinking about that how\nIs your investment if there isn't cash ... now thinking about this also if you own a piece of real estate\nAnd you know some stocks and the stocks go down you haven't lost anything but you haven't gained anything if you own a piece of real estate in the market shifts and the market value there was that goes down if you don't sell you haven't lost anything but you're still burning the distributions\nSo it's completely different\nIf you value of your stock goes down the amount of your distributions go down\nBut in the real estate world if the world's crashes and real estate values go down people stop buying houses\nAnd they start renting that's what happened in two thousand eight nine and continue to happen rents have gone up every single year since I've ever been a real estate idle seat rent decrees now I'm sure there are somewhere I mean but it has to be situational for example in Michigan Detroit\nWhen all the businesses went out of business that you know the auto dealers auto manufacturing lab is\nPeople left the city when people leave the city there's houses everywhere will then yes rents are going to go down and some houses can't be rented\nBut that's an anomaly you got to keep that in mind that to nominate it's not an anomaly in the stock market on any day week month or a year for that sucker to go down that just something that can do so casual by the way I was asked this question how do you retire if you don't have any casual\n... answer your phone number three appreciation\nWe all look at real estate against the stock market and the only number they count is appreciation\nSo their concept is is it real estate appreciates it like six or seven percent a year over the last hundred years and the stock market was appreciated by twelve percent per year over the last hundred years and by the way of making up both of those numbers but it's the kind of hogwash that they tell you\nAnd so most people when they buy real estate there they have this theory location location location they want to buy real estate in a good neighborhood because they think it's going to go up appreciate faster cause some bad neighborhoods don't appreciate all some pre she at one two three percent really good neighborhoods might appreciate six seven eight percent and some super hot air is a country might or subdivisions or\nCities or whatever some ... might appreciate as much as Fifteen Percent which would be just abnormal type of appreciation\nSo when they compare and they say to you that the stock market has always outperform real estate they're using only that one type of return which is appreciation\nNow something we can do that you can't do which is number four is something called forced appreciation forest appreciation is where\nYou take something and you can prove it\nAnd you force it to go up in value so we might go out there by the apartment complex for a million dollars renovated for a hundred thousand dollars and because of the renovations it's now worth two million\nAnd granted we put twenty five percent down on a million dollar deal putting two hundred and fifty thousand\nThese or whatever so I'm somewhat might appreciate as much as Fifteen Percent which would be just abnormal type of appreciation\nSo when they compare and they said you that the stock market has always outperform real estate they're using only one type of return which is appreciation\nNow something we can do that you can't do which is number four is something called forced appreciation forced appreciation is where\nYou take something and you will prove it\nAnd you force it to go up in value so we might go out there by the apartment complex for a million dollars renovated or a hundred thousand dollars and because of the renovations it's now worth two million\nAnd granted we put twenty five percent down on a million dollar deal putting two hundred fifty thousand dollars put it a hundred thousand ... up three hundred fifty thousand but we just made it go up and value to two million we've got a million wanted it that means we just made nine hundred thousand dollars on the three hundred and fifty thousand dollar does\nThat's a little shy of three hundred percent I don't see any appreciation like that type of British if you're going on anything but real estate\nWill take a short break here if you'd like to call in and interrupt this conversation we have two more whereas you can make money real

for a twenty four months you get moved into a Medicare plan\nUm there's to pass that you can take a to get Medicare um we spoke previously about Medicare a and B or we talked about see a little bit\nUh part D the drug side of it and I'm part D you stay on original Medicare or you need to buy a prescription drug plan and you can have a stand alone prescription drug plan that would work with the Medicare supplement plan to cover the twenty percent that a make or does not cover\nOriginal Medicare doesn't cover and then um you can also get a ... D plant inside the Medicare Advantage plan to call it an M. A. P. D. so the Medicare Advantage with the with a prescription drug plan built into it\nWell I'll tell you something but hey here's what the deal is okay there's a lotta alphabet in Medicare pay and people need to understand what they're doing there's a special day coming up and you want to talk about that\nYeah so the special day does October fifteenth it's the annual in Roman a date for Medicare so people can change their plans um people should have received what they call in and you'll notice that change uh in September it's called the a knock it'll it'll probably be spelled out in a knock butter stands for animals are changing the changes\nHappen inside the Medicare Advantage plans in the side of the prescription drug plan so they need to review your plan or or you call me and I hope to review that plan and do we find a plan either you stay in the play until you that that that's the best plan for you at this moment\nOr we find a plan that uh gives you better benefits are lower costs\nAnd your services are free\nCompletely free completely free carrier pages don't worry about it\nSo everything that he does is free for you he's a plus rated with the better Business Bureau and on top of that he has partnered with Jackson's carwash to you're going to get a free car wash from them at that valley why\nAs valley way that all their locations you attend one of our seminars we have to them coming up October fifteenth\nA with a brace health over at the the Denny's on the black ...

D It there's a one percent per month times the national average\nUh doesn't sound like a lot but I've had people be thirty six months late that's thirty six times per cent times of national average uh it's almost the amount of a premium for or what you're gonna have to pay for it and that's a lifetime Tony never goes way\nThis is a free service to you and you're going to get a free car wash along with it\nIn the valley why didn't he will continue the phone number six to seven seven zero nine zero six to he's a plus rating for the better Business Bureau check out his brand new website it is a B C D Medicare\nDot com and he is an advocate he got I'm Tania he is so passionate about what he does\nHow does this work this now with party let's talk about how it works\nAnd so part D um if you can only a a purchase a party plan through your private carrier or so these are um is not a party is not covered under original Medicare\nSo you have to purchase one or on the side that they call it a stand alone or you enter it through a Medicare Advantage prescription drug plan a combined in there so only through private carriers um which is all I represent all the carriers in the in the valley are pretty much all of them\nUm and so the way it works is that um there's the initial coverage so there's stages inside of a prescription drug plan a is a formula that all curious have to follow in terms of how they're built um there's a standard or so there's four stages inside of a prescription drug plan there is what they called the deductible stage\nUm the for two thousand Nineteen that's going to be four hundred and Fifteen dollars you'll pay the first four hundred Fifteen dollars an hour before\nUm the insurance starts covering a after that they go into what's called the initial coverage stage until you reach the remain neutral cover stage and you pay co pay\nOr for the prescriptions it depending on what type of a drug it is if it's at your one over to your five there now since you're six drugs they're moving into ... into chair sex drugs making a special category ...\nUm and so depending on what your level that drug is it could be a generic and be inside a church three you're going to pay about forty seven dollars forty five dollars a month for that\nSure one drugs either one from one to five dollars or sometimes ... so there are some co pays built into that so you stay inside the initial coverage ... until you reach 'em a dollar amount the dollar amount for two thousand and Nineteen is going to be moved up a little bit um so it's going to be three thousand eight hundred and twenty dollars of your spin\nAnd the carriers spin so the combined span of the total cost of the drug\nOnce you reach that limit you go into what they call the famous donut hole and you stay in the doughnut hole I'm basically you you start paying out a percentage of the cost for your drug\nDepending on what type of a drug it is if it's that you're one of our to your five there now some tears six drugs they're moving into ... into here six drugs making a special category ...\nUm and so depending on what your level that drug is that could be generic and be inside a church three you're going to pay about forty seven dollars forty five dollars a month for that\nSure one drugs can either one from one to five dollars or sometimes they're all so there are some co pay built into that so you stay inside the initial covered trade until you reach 'em a dollar amount the dollar amount for two thousand and Nineteen is going to be moved up a little bit um what's going to be three thousand eight hundred and twenty dollars of your spin and the carrier spent\nSo the combined span of the total cost of the drug\nOnce you reach that limit you go into what they call the famous donut hole\nAnd you stay in the doughnut hole I'm basically you you start paying out a percentage of the cost for your drug so are they fast forward the law believe a so that they was going to be waiting until I think two thousand twenty but they forward it\nWe're now you're you're percentage spin for a a brand drug is going to be twenty five percent of the total cost while you're in the doughnut hole\nAnd it's going to be thirty seven percent of the generic cos while you're in the doughnut hole and it sounds like it should be the other way around because generics generally cheaper but that's why they did it um so so for example if a\nPrescription drug costs June it's a brand new drug a hundred dollars you while you're in the ... uh the doughnut hole you it'll cost you twenty five dollars for that drug so you pay a twenty five percent of that drug\nUm so you stay inside what they called the a donut hole into your spin a reaches fifty one hundred dollars five thousand one hundred dollars for two thousand Nineteen I can be one tell\nIt could be it could be that these are not yet there's some that are pretty expensive some and these are prescriptions okay so you stay inside of their for until the fifth one or two hours and so um this is until your total spin or reaches fifty one hundred dollars is a once you reach get you one hundred dollars you go and what they call catastrophic coverage\nAnd in this phase of the prescription drug plan um you're going to pay the maximum of five percent of the total cost of the drug\nOr if it's a generic is three dollars and forty cents and if it's a brand new drug it is um three dollars and fifty or eight dollars and fifty cents my bad so uh so it so you can see just inside of one part of Medicare how complicated it\nCan I say I mean I was going in and ask you that when you're working with a client can marriage ABCD mhm right yeah and they're they're\nThey get to that point right you can help them when you when you're helping famine it's a free service for you to sit down and do that and you've got ten well once they are going now through the steel also help them because there's a lot to understanding that seems like afterwards as well\nYeah so we save save a lot of uh my clients' money in the prescription side of the the drug because there's the some of these drugs all these drugs are could be very expensive\nAnd so um I see people as much as five thousand dollars a year wow um I've had a lady who was on a hepatitis C program and I worked with her pharmacy um and hurt hepatitis C is expensive to to to church to help out um\nIt's a three month program foreigners stand and um it it costs about twelve to Fifteen thousand dollars a month just to deliver her the prescriptions and so we worked with finding her the right plan um that ... that pharmacy work to find her grant\nAnd um she needed a drug plan that would help cover the difference and so she basically of St yourself a lot of money over thirty thousand dollars um in terms of what these called drugs where the cost or so\nUh I spent a lot of time and I pride myself and making sure that uh when we review these plans whether it's a one drug or if it's a two twenty five drugs I've had people who are on twenty five oh a lot of people are\nAnd they protect people at the same time and that and that's kind of part of our signature we make them out of\nEr em eleventh we make out an eco friendly fabrics like ten cell bamboo cool best which are all much better than caught and because they were the sweat away from somebody a lot faster they dry quicker or they're just they're again eco friendly and they uh they're naturally anti bacterial and then we sandwich and a pharmaceutical grade\nUm filter in between the Internet or
