and that's\nQuite a thing I was just really impressed with her accuracy and being right on the money on everything and Kelly and that's exactly what would happen and when and we just a at a real good experience\nHigh solar tend to hear currently you're buying power from your company's paying\nThese cameras in all kinds of hurting real interesting I Want you to save money on a bill you're already spending too much and it's going to keep going up to get paid even silver bullet might get a little more me and then I come to your house panel you mean and how my ... year old power was leaving no more highly filming it gets\nReally might now he produced Ron Howard Taylor or go\nTo my website and Sandy Sandy ... if a tree\nTo the show everyone and happy Labor Day we candidates Labor Day weekend for everybody to have a good time and be safe that's all this important but it's still hot\nAnd we still have a solar Sandy it's here in Studio welcome back to the show tell everybody you are on a mission you been on a mission since I met you tell everybody why you're here so much\nWhy am I hearing so much because everybody has to fill everybody has the power bill that we all\nWe are all very frustrated especially this summer I'm seeing so many people that have pulled me listening to our show Carol\nI'm and I'm On different radio shows as well and my whole mission is because of my daughter\nFive years ago [noise] um that I wasn't able to help my own daughter pay her power bill due to an accident and then I had many years ago I myself was on a fixed income Social Security disability and when she reached out to me and said mom I really need help with my ...\nI said well honey I really can't help you that much with your ... but by the way how much does it\nAnd when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident and I said ... you have a little tiny house how could you ...\nBut he has a lot to fill everybody has the power bill that we all\nWe are all very frustrated especially this summer I'm seeing so many people that have called me listening to our show Carol\nI'm and I'm On different radio shows as well and my whole mission is because of my daughter\nFive years ago [noise] um that I wasn't able to help my own daughter pay her power bill due to an accident and then I had many years ago I myself was on a fixed income Social Security disability and when she reached out to me and said mom I really need help with my ...\nI said well honey I really can't help you that much with your part built but by the way how much does it\nAnd when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident and I said ... you have a little tiny house how is your purview however build these so high\nI sit there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and heart goes from a PS ... 'cause atheists and that's where people had some dues or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake ... let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nSecret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management let me talk about that would see on our built this thing called demanded a lot of people an ape you this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe ... team point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hardest time of the day between three and have him and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies in a monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest summer day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and they gave it an example before people were keeping the thermostat\nTo it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power from last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM\nIt is the hardest time of the day between three and eight PM and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies in a monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest some of the day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and they gave the example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\n... there's no place to go except to them on and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it\nSo the smart energy management the way to the analogy that people like like that I've been told is remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance\nMonday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay ... a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist don't matter when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing in the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when the hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for a home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars and forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rate plan is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal\nUm I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have an auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay for a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nUpset about it is ... ... it's criminal\nUm I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it it's a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS and as you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect\nYou anymore so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's going to continue to go up\nAnd now I've walked in my own power rate from my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars and a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them and I explain all this to them\nSo not only are you paying between seven and half a neat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying towards the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit of youth increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living more comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are gone to continue to go up they are never going to stop where they're at um\nIt it just it doesn't make sense for them they built in Ukrainian rates everybody should just call you just find out how to read\nTheir bill and then I don't know how to read their ... and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if you go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people who will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site ... I Do a rate I'm review and break it\nDown it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us\nThat have been hearing a four year year and a half and today there is out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to click on a time and then they go home now I understand what she writes and so no judgments but at the end of the day we\nHave an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here\nBreak it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half and then the natives out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to click all the time\nAnd then they go home now I understand what she rains and so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simply this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car\nAnd gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and the two fifty and that's essentially Carol\nI'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS ... great punch today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home we use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid for the power company\nCut that in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money well here's what we're\nGonna do we want to give out your phone number because everyone really should just give her a call she does a free consultation she's raised with the better Business Bureau I just found out at that out and uh her phone number direct it is six to three\nEight five zero eight two two nine she wants you to go up on her website it is ask solar Sandy dot com go to ... make sure it's ... dot com\nFilled out the kilowatt worksheet and she can help you save money on a bill that you're already paying way too much money on what are your final words for today you know\nIt it's the simplest is you know I really am on the mission and when I helped my daughter it was the first time in a long time due to my circumstances that I was able to do\nSomething really significant in her life because I financially wasn't able to help her but I saw the really big problem for her and it gave me\nA self accomplishment in it she was so ever so grateful\nThen she shared it with her neighbors and a lot of her neighbors did it because the than I was able to help them understand that my daughter was able to help them understand it\nSo now it's about I'm there to educate\nIt gives people the the information so that they can make an informed decision about their own power costs they wouldn't let somebody else choose their host what kind of payment they could afford for mortgage they wouldn't let somebody ... ... how much they could afford for car why would people\nUntil maybe since they just haven't got the information yet but let's get you with the right information you can make an informed decision about your power cause\nShe's valley wide it's no obligation free consultation to you out there she had lots of incentives to that she offers to everyone the number to call her direct it is area code six to three eight five zero eight two two nine go on that website and check out the ... ... feet it's asked sell solar Sandy dot com\nLook how much they could afford for car why would people and you know maybe they just haven't got the information yeah but let's get Hugh with the right information you can make an informed decision about your power\nComes she's valley right it's a no obligation free consultation to you out there she has a lot of incentives to that she offers to everyone the number to call her direct it is area code six to three eight five zero eight two nine go on that website and check out the ... seat it's asked sell solar Fannie dot com\nAnd it was going to continue to go up\nAnd I couldn't go back to nursing because of my back injury and my my medical um issues and I said you know I Wonder how many other people are needing to save money off their power costs and um and how how could I helped them\nAnd in and helping them getting the correct and accurate information as they did for my daughter and you know I'll go back just a little ways because I didn't do this then I was just doing this as a as a mom and grandma trying to help my own daughters for making sure all the questions were answered [noise]\nUm this was her home this is where she and my my children my grandchildren live\nSo I wanted to make sure you know everything was taken care of in a in a proper and correct way and so I left no stone unturned by making sure I did all the reading and all the research\nSo you know fast forward once I saw that this really worked for her and there was great saving for her producing her own power and she was paying significantly less for it I said how can I help others a benefit from it I have to interrupt you because there's a part of the story that\nYou're not telling and I want to tell it\nSo solar Sandy is all about\nChecking information because what it was is that she was with her daughter and listening to this person whoever it was at the time and said I'm not getting it I'm not you're not doing you're not answering what it is it I Want you to answer\nAnd instead of just saying I forget it I Will just pay the bill and whatever you were like I'm going to find out more and that's what she does she's a researcher more than anything she is and so you did that and you started looking at deep into it deeper yes and finding out\nThere is a better solution absolute and you found that solution and once you found that solution and you had her do it you said let's go with this has got a good idea to see that she's now saving money what you said I Want everybody in Hawaii\nHas to have it now um you said that's when you said\nI Wonder if a lot of other people probably don't\nThat she was with her daughter and listening to this person whoever it was at the time and said I'm not getting it I'm not you're not doing you're not answering what it is that I Want you to answer\nAnd instead of just saying I forget it I Will just pay the bill and whatever you were like I'm going to find out more and that's what she does she's a researcher more than anything she is and so you did that and you started looking into deep into it deeper and finding out\nThere is a better solution absolute and you found that solution and once you found that solution and you had her do it you said let's go with this has got a good idea to see that she's now saving money what you said oh yeah everybody in Hawaii has to have it now um\nYou said that's when you said\nI Wonder if a lot of other people probably don't get this kind of information so you started your own sort of business if you want to say I think I'm going to become the solar expert and you did not have been doing it for many many years it's not like I'm saying this on purpose I'm saying that on purpose because you know what\nA lot of people don't know the story and I love the story that you've been doing this for a long time like four years at least and so she knows what she's talking about she's now been on radio everywhere right television everywhere okay\nIf I don't know where else just because of me but that's okay we want at any about any of\nIs because the and it's true it's Carol you know I I feel like I have a responsibility to pay it forward and put this information forward because\nThe as nice as these and I'm fifty seven I'll call anybody under fifty a kid so sore if you're under fifty and listening but I found as nice as these young men were that were trying to explain it to myself and my daughter\nThey were not getting me to the answers and explaining it fully the way that I felt comfortable in moving how and having my daughter move forward with it\nAnd I I was frustrated and I'm sure there's lots of people that are listening to us and that have listened to us that say you know I ... and they've called me because of us talking just exactly the way that we are the people have had\nOther solar ... I'm not a solar cells person but they they they have had other solar salespeople knock on their door emailed them incessantly called them incessantly\nThat is not who I Am I have gone Under Cover with the electric companies\nI have um ... I mean you have no idea how many hours it is taking me to peel back all the layers of how\nThis works so that my family's the hopeful that I work with the work with me or saving the maximum amount and receiving the maximum benefits of going solar solar is not about just putting solar panels on people's Ruth it never really was but it's certainly not isn't now\nBecause the power companies have made it so complicated if you don't have the right amount of solar panels on your roof\nOn with the smart energy management and the the um on the right rape plan you could end up as being almost like my daughter ended up being a bad solar story you could end up being about Toy Story so I tell people that there are lots and lots of these solar sales people out there\nI'm not one of them I'm going to sit down I'm going to explain things to you I'm going to show you you have an option a continual wind power from the power company that bill is certainly going to go up and you're going to live more uncomfortable in your\nOf going solar solar is not about just putting solar panels on people's through it never really was but it's certainly not is it now because the power companies have made it so complicated if you don't have the right amount of solar panels on your roof\nOr with the smart energy management and the the um on the rate rate plan you could end up as being almost like my daughter ended up being a bad solar story you could end up being a bad story so I tell people that there are lots and lots of these soldiers sales people out there\nI'm not one of them I'm going to sit down I'm going to explain things to you I'm going to show you you have an option a\nContinue buying power from the power company that does certainly going to go up and you're going to live more uncomfortable in your home pork producer on power he left were between seven and a half and he has to do a lot of luck in your ... live more comfortable in your home more money in your own home in your pocket and not the the power\nCompany so here's what we're going to do are going to go to a break her ... when you can check her out on a website it's ... solar Sandy dot com and when we come back we're to talk about some really important stuff\n... ... ... ...\nYou are looking for TB Irene ... who had acted in generally cared about saving lives contact Arizona maybe our training during the ... you will work with someone who I never really been on TV I really feel like you had said like\nOne of the average with as many people as possible how inconvenient chimney above their class now how five year old would you for when you stop anyone go to W.

one more a Supreme pick\nPossibly too so uh because Ginsburg she should she needs to get out of there she can't even speak she so far gone\nReally she needs to go it's time for her to go but she's

with them they wanted to see if first of all they could break this man which they didn't they didn't break them they should have tried you know it it it broke\nHave to see his poor kids go through what they they had to go through but you know at\nAll so you had a slight was another joke we can get into him later on but my question to you ladies and gentlemen is we're going to go over some of this stuff but are there going to be any repercussions for Dianne Feinstein and her staff\nBecause you know Donald Trump brought up a perfect uh example\nAnd played it a perfect late at night over ... we didn't leak that did you if you look at her body language her body language alone they did it All right she also was the one that said here you get these lawyers\nThat believe me this was all on hit machine\nI couldn't get in I have a list of things do about the CIA we found out that the other woman\nWas a camper with right with an axe FBI so you you got a bunch of structure walking around your ... this week we had what that at that usually a sweat next she went on a in DC and made a fool of herself\nA hurt her ex soul man said she's a nut case you have the actual man of\n... a mess for saying she's another one\nYou ... ... you know what I'm saying you have this other woman saying the FBI\nTold her to\nA basically you know just change your ... you know think a little harder and that did you see what the hell is going on out here this is what this whole thing is leaving leaving Kaiser now nobody's bringing this factor up\nAnd I caught this and I forget who the hell I heard it was only one other guy and he's one of the guys and I can't remember who it was but remember how they kept respond to lead Lynn ties are as a man member even you know leaving Kaiser rolling Kaiser is a girl\nSo it's Ken's to tell you what the letter that they wrote she might not I mean because don't you think no matter what if Dr a doctor fraud but that's what that's the latest one everybody's calling her but a a missile sport I'm not even get a caller a doctor\nOr do you think of his stuff that I'm going to bring up to you you're again and uh but do you notice the type of people that she's associated with a ... that that should be a thing and you got this Monica McLean\nFactor up and I caught\nThis and I forget who the hell I heard it was only one other guy\nAnd he's one of the sharp guys and I can't remember who it was but remember they kept was going to lead Lynn Kaiser as a man remember even you know leaving Kaiser rolling Kaiser is a girl\nSo it's Ken's to tell you what the letter that they wrote\nShe might not I mean because don't you think no matter what if Dr a doctor flawed\nBut that's what that's the latest one everybody's calling her but a a missile sport I'm not even get a caller a doctor or do you think of his stuff that I'm going to bring up to you you're again and uh but do you notice the\nType of people that she's associated with a and that's that that she'd be a thing and you got this Monica McLean now tampering my question to you is\nIs they're going to be a repercussion is somebody gonna get in trouble if somebody gonna get basically Sabine at\nAt least the Congress for question because there has to be even ... I mean look at the charades that went on for how many weeks and it needs to have so we're going to go through this again\nAnd then you got you know my son Michael Savage my brother he's out there running around loose\nHe can handle this stuff anymore either I mean he's he's he wanted a me just like I did but I personally think this guy after watching him\nOr you don't want somebody to be honest with you that some hard right wing radical either so and after looking at his family and his daughter and his wife and how United they are this is a good family that's America that's\nAn American family so I have no problem I'm very proud of him I congratulate him and his family thank God this is at least over for tonight with the Democrat Party it's over\nUh like I said that you have that other idiot from Jersey is already a the senator or that complete idiot I Can't even think the ... name off the top of my head a he's out there well we we're not we're going to impeach start saying that\nMan I Want all these Democrats out there to go right ahead and continue to keep saying this stuff because what needs to be done is dismissed McLean needs to be arrested and on public TV and it needs to be it won't be brought up on CNN\nBut you know but the whole the\nWhole process was a joke\nEven during the voting today did you guys see the voting\nOkay during the voting you got protesters just yelling and going how are they getting past security booze paying security to believe me when I have security nobody get anywhere\nBelieve me thousands of people and believe me one person's not going to get past my security anybody security you're paying security nobody's getting so somebody's letting these people and\nYou understand is that what needs to be also looked into all this crap needs to be looked up and do you saw how Lindsey Graham he's the one that old everybody out you're damn right it was it was about time it's about\nTime that somebody stood up for this beautiful country it's about time somebody got the rats and stuff and shut that damn it machine down that communist group down that's what they are you go ahead you vote and vote for Christian sent him I'm going to\nSecurity to believe me when I have security nobody get anywhere\nBelieves me thousands of people and believe me one person's not gonna get past my security anybody security your band security ... nobody's getting so somebody's letting these people and\nYou understand is that what needs to be also looked into all this crap needs to be looked up and do you saw how Lindsey Graham he's the one that old everybody out you're damn right he was it was about time it's about\nTime that somebody stood up for this beautiful country it's about time somebody got the rats and stuff and shut that damn it machine down that communist group down that's what they are you go ahead you\nGo and vote for Christians ... I'm going to get into that one too late or raw\nBecause what I'm I'm a I'm Out in Scottsdale right now broadcasting and the bottom line here is ladies and gentlemen I'd come back into town I started reading papers in their Christian ... winning ... well I understand\nThat miss mix Sally has a sour plus\nOh we're talking space she's got a ugly mug All right I understand that she's got and and and I understand she's always gotta smuggle look and she's sometimes worse than the other one that I used to yell about\nBut she at least ... Congress person or the other one is nothing so that's what you have to look at but the bottom line here is\nI preach to you people how many for how many years that this was what was going to happen and send them a you know I can tell you that most of the people we can look and I'll go over this later on what you see in the whole thing but cinema is the one that could do the actual damage to the Republican\nOut here uh out of this whole race I Believe a lot of the other or Republicans are going to be fine but then a ma\nOr just because a lot of people just point blank don't like the way that makes Sally act the way she looks and the way she projects herself to you the\nAmerican voter and we'll get into that later on so uh did you mean it was on ... bowl\nTo watch that uh I didn't even I watched a couple of minutes of it I had to turn it off with that you really a ... a sweat neck I mean a complete liar her story changed\nAnd that's it now how come they're not investigating this how come that are born lawyers and being investigated how come he even still has a practicing law license I Will never understand she you have to go after people ladies and gentlemen how many times if I told you people\nOn this show that the way you continue in the way to be the left and to crush little asked OK is to continue to put these groups and sue these anti American groups\nPut them in court when these cases break them and continue to keep them in court like they do to us and until we get wise on that matter now we have the main court\nOur hands it's time\nEven harder we're not done slap them down I'm not even half way done they're black and blue they're going to be bleeding by the time I even think about letting up I'll be right back\n[laughter]\nThe way you continue in the wake you beat the lap and to watch little asked\nOK is to continue to put these groups and do these anti American groups put them in court when these cases break them and continue to keep them in court like they do last\nAnd until we get wise on that matter now we have the main court\nOur hands\nTo stand them up even harder we're not done slap them down I'm not even half way done they're black and blue they're going to be bleeding by the time I even think about what ... I'll be right back [noise]\n\nThat's what I Would rather take than just get guarded at this point in time and then maybe we'll find some other people down the road but I understand where you're coming from I just hope that\nThis whole or deal with the Democratic party through this nominee process has\nPumped you guys are ... just to go out and beat the Democrat Party I don't give a damn if they put Mickey Mouse on the car you go for Mickey Mouse if he's going to be a a Democrat and that's what I'm hoping it's going to happen even in California\nI mean they are uh did did you guys hear the latest one in uh San Francisco I gotta tell ya I was disgusted and a please are they now have an app\nFor your phone where you can take a picture of a pile of feces and send it to the bureau to tell them where it is so that's how I so I guess it's okay uh ... it's just getting better and better out there\nIt's a pleasure to come back out or your home town Arizona for God's sake uh let me tell you that they defeat sees the needles\nAnd they just don't care you have Tyson's going around out there you're going to have flag you're going to have all this crap going on out there\nBelieve me it's already starting up and I'm not going to go along with how it creates but you know uh when we get to where\nThey have to take a picture of deep deep in the street type apps through ... that that this is to stop and you wonder why we call it San Francisco\nThere's another example of a why the hell I Want to get the hell out of there so uh it's really out of control Feinstein it doesn't like I said it doesn't matter who they could and it'll be worse\n... ... it's just getting better and better out there\nIt's a pleasure to come back out of your home towers owner for God's sake uh let me tell you the ... defeat to ease the needles and they just don't care you have Tyson's going around out there you're going to have ... you're going to have all this crap going on out there\nBelieve me it's already starting up and I'm not going to go along with how it creates but you know uh when we get to where\nThey have to take a picture of deep deep in the street type apps through ... that that this is fixed up and you wonder why we call it San Francisco\nThere's another example of a why the hell I Want to get the hell out of there so uh it's really out of control Feinstein it doesn't like I said it doesn't matter who they could and it'll be worst\nAnd it gets worse because the point of the matter is I and also you have you're going to have the earring coming up I Want to see where cabin up rules on this California matter\nSo when we're going to find out about this suing of the uh uh California we're going to find out about that where the D. O. J. is doing what they are but the point of the matter is is that\nIt's time if you see out there even in these a\nA protest people are getting handcuffed and and shoved across the screen on TV\nThat people are recording this and if you look at the protests or even when they these were all set up and they were paid for I Know everybody else can save you know I've been telling you this for how long George Soros I mean as far as I'm concerned George Soros should have been a a warrant for his arrest in\nThe United states\nBut he's not allowed anywhere near Russia gluten wants him to so you know I don't understand why that because he's tampering with our elections he's how many years since he's been tampering is machines same process that you add out here in Arizona\nSo ... when the hell are some of these criminals we call them villains right\nBatman world when the bill is going to get\nShoved\nJust\nRight down Africa Deborah avenue where the media shows these people\nAre getting repercussions\nAnd kill they get consequences the little people on the streets go I can get away with it\nThe way it works it's just like with the little kid my dad did this I'm going to do this people you'd look up look at the ball players you look up to the ball players they Neal you got the kid's meal it you got kids you don't think kids are kneeling behind their parents back\nEven though that you could have parents that think like me and then the kid goes in the meals 'cause he's with his friends uh believe me that's going on don't don't kid yourself out there Oh yes it is\nBut you know we need to just like I said nip it in the bud and it's slowly but surely getting nipped in but as you see we've already had Donald Trump or two years now we have to federal\nSupreme Court judges

I mean to dial it never even made it to\nTrump but the point in the matter is you see what it's going on out there to society or some of the stuff as a normal uh to get things done less let's do this let's do that\nRight by the way you know a less hurt people it's a good thing to do I mean this is the sickness that we the people are going through a and we have to witness this stuff\nI like I didn't even bring up the shooting in Florence South Carolina uh you you had the cop was killed right others injured and that's forgotten about ... when was that I think on Monday or something you go through so much news it the normal person\nCan't keep up\nThey really cannot keep up unless you do this for a living you're you're really most people cannot keep up because\nCompletely out of control it really is if you look at things and you just say to yourself or is this for real because it\nSome of the things that you see going on are just so way out in left field that you're ... you're going you gotta be kidding you're gotta be kidding me\nSo what do you do next that's the that's the million dollar question is what do you do that you get out in November and you got to make sure that you wrote\nWe got to clean the place up get ready for the two thousand twenty election because that's when that that we're going to completely be able to defeat\nI mean one hundred percent you've got to defeat these people right now you rarely you we do but the point of the matter is\nIt's going to take a little bit of time as we see I've learned that one member we talked the bill we uh [noise] or CIA ... and he's still nobody knows what's going on with him you are taking time off from the being a harassed or you go down there being harassed\nIt but we're I'm learning to patient\nI have to by the way a me myself and I and maybe if you maybe to other people and you know might\nEat baby sat Raj ... out there he am after and I never did I came on last week and I uh uh Rachel Michel\n... Arizona prosecutor did a hell of a job on her report number like I told you she could have been harder and I know some people were mad I backer she thought she pulled out enough proof\nOkay that the woman was a liar she wrote the report up this week and\nThat came out\nAnd what happens ladies and gentlemen the Democrat Party disagree\nDislike less member last week at this time they wanted the FBI we're all in math and just like\nEverybody was cursing just like the Democrat Party that that's fine everything's going to be okay we just want to have one week of an investigation and then we get the one week of an investigation and they want more this they would have thank God that I'm telling you this people\nWe and I uh uh Rachel Michel ... Arizona prosecutor did a hell of a job on her report number like I told you she could have been harder and I know some people were mad I backed her she got she pulled out enough proof\nOkay that the woman was a liar she wrote the report out this week\nAnd that came out and what happens ladies and gentlemen the Democrat Party disagreed\nDislike less member last week at this time they wanted the FBI we're all in math and just like\nEverybody was cursing just like the Democrat Party that that's fine everything's going to be okay we just want to have one week of an investigation and then we get the one week of an investigation and they want more this thing would have thank God\nThat I'm telling you this people thank God Grassley got a hold of I guarantee you what happened is they read something in that record and that was it and I guarantee you there was bullied me you heard a idiot what's his name\nThe Jews that would sell the Jews down the river for the holy dollar bill that does it actually as much as we can Chuck Schumer\nRight you add Mr a New York you out there liberal to a that like I said he oh there was stuff in there believe me there was nothing in the FBI report because it would have been leaked you know that I Know that Chuck E. cheese no crackers\nOkay so you know once again like I said they were all his stuff out there because they think\nThe American people are dumb what they haven't realized is and and I don't I I'm I'm I don't think they're going to realize anything until November until you take everything completely away from them they don't realize that their first of all not wanted\nA second of all they don't realize that they're being outrageous\nYou see you think that this was outrageous you you take what they did to but cabin up if you like Brett Kavanaugh for you didn't like Brett Kavanaugh I don't give a damn but next person that they're going to pull this crap on it you know the American citizen and that's why I get pissed off\nI mean we're looking at a guy that basically here I'm going to talk to everybody like I Would if I was hanging around with the guys I mean this is a guy that didn't go I'll get laid jury went out and he had a couple of drinks with the guys like we all did when we were teenagers and all of a sudden\nHe goes through school he becomes somebody works with the president of the United states and now you know and then becomes a a a judge\nAnd now on top to the federal and now he is a federal judge but the point of the matter is this guy was a good\nKid good boy whatever you want to call it ... he wouldn't be where he is\nOkay if he was a Democrat they hand you these positions look it's like Trump said how in the hell is Blumenthal how in the hell\nIs that guy a senator he lied about his ah war he he was in war he was in combat he was in my ass\nOkay he was in all talk no action he got stood up again today by Donald Trump and I'm Glad and this is what we have to do it because you see you as a media ladies and gentlemen out there that props up the Democrat Party now murder is against the law but at the Democratic\nParty murders somebody the media ... stood up and says it's okay realistically that's what's going on out there they are killing our constitution every single day on ...\nIf he was a Democrat they hand you these positions look it's like Trump said how in the hell is this Blumenthal\nHow in the hell is that guy a senator he lied about his\nA war he he was in war he was in combat he was in my ass\nOkay he was in all talk no action he got stood up again today by Donald Trump and I'm Glad and this is what we have to do it because you see you have a media ladies and gentlemen out there that props up the Democrat Party now murder is against the law but at the Democratic\nParty murders somebody the media ... sit up and says it's okay\nRealistically that's what's going on out there they are killing our constitution every single day\nOn what the\nTV they get through to these dumb kids right\nBecause we were all come kids we bought into all that because who do you believe when you're younger that TV right until you find out how many times if I told you guys that\nWhen do you use when you grow up you start seeing it in my position when you talk to media you see how they dealt twenty five years they're liars you say Hi they said he never said that\nHe hit they come out with stuff that you don't even know what the hell's going on now you know just like this fabric Haitian ah from the the a Stormy Daniels porn lawyer\nWhy would something like that I personally think that was the the end of it at that point\nOkay that was it for even a lot of Democrats people said oh that they threw their arms up and they're they're probably not if they're not going to vote Republican but they're probably not going to go out and vote and I think that we're we're going to have a chance this year because\nYou just can't go out on people I don't why there's a lot of people everywhere your your partner anybody believe me I like people but the point of the matter is people I don't like I still don't want a any harm or ill ill will towards them\nI never been like that I mean I might if they want to hurt me then that's a whole different story or something and you have to self defend yourself that's another story like I said I developed the demand the cool run right\nThe demons cool but he's running yeah I can run and believe me but the situation people we just have to come together\nAs we did this week I Believe we came together with the poles when you when they when a lot of the senator saw the poles\nOf the way the Democratic party dropped\nI Believe a lot of people called the senators you've got to start doing this you've got to get involved like you didn't two thousand six team this year but one thing that the Democrat Party does have over in the Republican Party as they can put together a group\nThey can put together a message and they can put that message out\nMatter if it's true\nDoesn't matter if it means absolutely Italy squat but bottom line is that's one thing the Democratic party does also the Democrat Party back to each other no matter what\nPoker cook every Democrat always back each Democrat that's not the way it is and the Republican Party now you saw was what fifty forty eight\nOr it could have we shouldn't have even had to get to that point yeah Murkowski she's a piece of garbage I she's on her own life\nTo pull her stun now you know who she is you what you have going on is the same situation and Arizona is what they do is they put Democrat and Republican positions they call themselves Republican and look\nThey can put together a message and they can put that message out doesn't matter if it's true doesn't matter if it means absolutely Italy squat but bottom line is that's one thing the Democratic party does\nAlso the Democrat Party back each other no matter what poker cook every Democrat always back\nEach Democrat that's not the way it is in the Republican Party now you saw was what fifty forty eight\nOr ... we shouldn't have even had to get to that point yeah Murkowski\nShe's a piece of garbage\nI she's all like the polar star\nNow you know who she is you what you have going on at the same situation and Arizona is what they do is they would give a crap in Republican positions they call themselves Republican and look at what you are going on that's what you have going on right down the board so a\nWise ... be smart don't be hostile dopey scam I Believe this week was crucial for the United states of America I also believe this week\nProved a lot to do some people to people well let's see what we are the sort of even though the FBI look at what the FBI done but Donald Trump they set the damn man up we have the proof that they that Donald Trump got but meanwhile this fake\nThe Democrat Party works against the American people on a daily basis if you you would have to be a fool to sit there and vote for a Democrat and what gets me are these people that vote for Democrats that aren't even from my our country that don't even represent\nThe state the right way\nPeople that are that are not even really American uh Americanized and go running and actually people are dumb enough to get these people vote there while the white man the white man I Will continue to tell you found the damn country\nMust get that out there again because I Know some go read your history I Can't change history\nAll right it wasn't founded by the ... it was an founded by the black man it wasn't founded by China was unfounded by any but it was founded by a honky so until you people out there in college get your history straight in\nAnd start representing what this country stands for it doesn't stand for but white man\nThis country stands for freedom this country stands for red white and blue freedom constitution law and order which we're getting back affect those to date the man was hired\nCountry must get that out there again because I Know some go read your history I Can't change history\nAll right it wasn't founded by the ... it was impounded by the black man it wasn't founded by China wasn't founded by any but it was founded by a honky\nSo until you people out there in college you get your history straight in and start representing what this country stands for it doesn't stand for but white man\nThis country stands for freedom this country stands for red white and blue freedom\nLaw and order which we're getting back affect those to date the man was hired\nLast day of America did you hear on the on the way out talking or are very bad\nFor America you know watch hockey if America\nHad the greatest day in a long long time today and you don't like it it was a great day right one block Obama handed over free cash how many billions of dollars\nTo Iran it was a great day when our\nMilitary Knievel\nWere on their knees crying to the Iran military wasn't it shockey a\nWas a great day for you Democrats right one block Obama wrote an executive order for DACA it was a great day screw the American people right but\nOf the matter here ladies and gentlemen across this beautiful country you have American citizens that don't give a damn that they're getting screwed they actually go along with it and said the rich man the rich man is what makes the damn country go around\nAnd believe me a lot of these people that talk all this trash all the time if they had money they would be acting the same way\nNow you're liberals that are way out of commission they have so much money they don't know what to do because people cater to them they give them three money it's just like in the in the music industry I learnt like I told you guys how many times you people out there that do recordings go buy your own damn studios they make them today where I\nThink you can put 'em in the computers\nAnd all that crap go by yourself ... why are you paying some idiot and asking him does my song sound good you know\nThat I learned years ago and you can as I worked with the best\nThe best and we used to get in big big time arguments over I don't like what you did and this guy goes all I did this for guns and roses and I ... I don't still don't like that what you're doing the muscle man you know because I have a different\nLook and until you not and they used to say do it yourself so I learned many many years ago\nBasically that's how you have to do it and just sit and get these people free money even in I'm starting to see in the radio business and even when I run around and Phoenix they're like well this guy I knew I give these people get Italy squat\nDaily Scott I Am worth more money than any of these idiots and I do a lot of stuff just off the cuff for people to be a good guy I have to do you know I'm certain commercials and stuff I have to charge people but in a life in general\nI'm not the guy that here I have to come down it costs to twenty five hundred come see me like this\nWould pay somebody twenty ... who would give that little nothing twenty five hundred year old school you are a pool\nAnd that that's how it is over it that other station they're all about\nThey do it yourself so I learned many many years ago basically that's\nHow you have to do it and didn't get the people free money even in I'm starting to see in the radio business and ... even when I run around in scenic they're like well describe I give these people generally squat\nTo Italy ... I Am worth more money than any of these idiots that I Do a lot of stuff just off the top for people to be a good guy I have to do you know on certain commercials and stuff I have to charge people but in ... in general\nI'm not the guy that year I have to come down and talk to twenty five hundred to come see me like you\nWould pay somebody twenty would get that little nothing twenty five hundred year old school you are able to\nAnd that that's how it is over it that other station they're all about the cash right and they're all about the it believe me I've seen it out here it's a joke it is a joke and you know what the joke of the matter is people actually give them the money\nThat's what cracks me up so and and the and it doesn't even work because like I said when you're a out of failing station how is it going to work when you only have two people holding up\nYou know because you you got out during that you've got a late morning and afternoon radio and then nobody listens to it yeah ... I mean I ... I was you know people people listening to it and that's why I Need to get on year four to seven and you guys will see how it's done\nI'll show you how I Will build a radio show within two years I Will be just like we did here look at what we did hear we came to\nThe state of Arizona we put the talking one rock and radio show on the hell happened we became number one and the Saturday Night shows were dropping like flies I'll be right back [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you're living history museum off the Seventeen and pioneer road just north of carefree highway with one of the most of the rest of the elections frontier building an old rule out and much more families have the opportunity to sit back in time\nAnd she was all about even while we're doing like reenactments comes female leaders are now with the hundred for more information those huge W.

D. J. T.\nYeah yeah I mean and I think uh this crap\nToo with Susan Collins speech and it's awful ... it it ... I was cursing and yelling or\nWhen I was listening to what are you done this [laughter] and and that's why I I I had a buddy they're writing me oh you're soured on Sean Hannity that's what Michael Savage was doing I didn't even less than really to Michael this week\nHe kinda ... while she was talking and he was like oh you're giving me a migraine or he was hilarious\nYeah I said he's probably saying the same thing that is that I Am because that's how we are I mean this who gives a damn you were gonna vote any way you should have voted we shouldn't have even had to go through this big it should've been struck down when the letter was produced at the wrong time\nThat that we that that it\nSo but the good news is they're hurting bad man they spend a lot of money and they lost\nI I think the deployed old man or the honorable or ... for a mile I think a ... he he played this will whether he intended to or not and uh yeah ... and you know squishy what's his name ah the turtle I'm a\nPart of me I Can't I Can't think of his name now offering Kentucky or\nMore down to a a a a McConnell\nYeah he he I I'm telling you like I said\nI'm with you on that I'm with these guys today\nThey did their job doesn't matter we still have ... I Believe that a lot of this had to do Glenn was the people I Believe these people got phone calls I Believe\nWhere the media continues to show us write this bull crap on the news every body is protesting they're not showing you that probably thousands and thousands and hundreds of thousands of people make calls the ... Senate and the all these people\nThey just didn't change their mind overnight and especially when that FBI report came out I Believe\nThe turtle I'm a part of me I Can't I Can't think of his name now offering Kentucky\nMore down to a a a a McDonald's or\nYeah he he I I'm telling you like I said I'm with you on that I'm with these guys today\nThey did their job doesn't matter we still have ... I Believe that a lot of this had to do Glenn was the people I Believe these people got phone calls I Believe\nWhere the media continues to show us write this bull crap on the news everybody is protesting the rats showing that probably thousands and thousands and hundreds of thousands of people make calls the ... Senate and the all these people\nThey just didn't change their mind overnight and especially when that FBI\nReport came out I Believe when McConnell read that it\nGoes this is a scam yeah he just\nHe's he's able to uh uh all these Republicans are able to do to borrow some DNA DNA from a Donald Trump's mind as a way I look at it\nYeah well he bumped him up and I think he'd pumped him up when he went at these rallies at the beginning but when he went to Tennessee [laughter] he he was the only one sitting there Lindsey Graham\nKid thought Donald Trump realistically was the only one that stood up for Brett Kavanaugh for how long a factor of last week a Lindsey Graham stepped up to the plate and then Monday morning we had every uh you know all the leaders actually came out they because they got calls and people are there\nOkay ... the thing is I think the land is beat they're starting to realize that people are getting sick to be people bowing down that's what I think it is\nThey are they are indeed and um he let it ...\nI Hope we have this name a charcoal and nice grin on our face a in for Tuesday's\nOr from this Tuesday let's hope that by ten eleven o'clock at night we're all happy I can come in on Saturday and just let loose with the big screen because that's what this country needs\nMy main [laughter] ... there are going to be more ... and certainly people stomach like you said\nOh they're hurting very bad today they emit Arabs and or I mean well yeah and they spent a lot more money than you are being told look at the here that they put out on a\nOn Kavanaugh that the H ... a ... a ACLU did you see that ad with and they they they don't care they threw Clinton and they grow a wind seen under the river and then they put a wreck have enough in the same league as those guys you know what it was proven\nThat we still have hope and that's all we couldn't do my brother how long I've been saying all we can do is hope that when we lose hope is when we lose\nHim in ... and we got a patient\nDo my brother how long I've been saying all we can do is hope when we lose hope is when we lose\nYour man ... do you forgot to patients\nTime you got it and keep them rather you got it God Bless brother will turn out and then seeing how right now\nYou guys ... we have got to stay together as a team just like you said we cannot we cannot\nI repeat we cannot take for granted today\nThis was a huge when like I said very very very huge winning but we can't take it for granted this is like a four game series that we're in right now we're right now to game so we need to come in like I told you we have got to win in November\nAnd to watch the American dream\nTo watch our constitution\nTo Koch the plan I guess what you guys want to call it the Donald J Trump plan the American plan is really what it is\nBut the ... that we have to win game four and two thousand twenty in this election that comes up with Donald Trump's which you see is polls are moving up what is the over fifty breeze over fifty percent coming out of all the polls that tends to tell me he's way up\nAlways remember when they give you a poll on Donald Trump they're probably pulling ten percent back I'll put money each polling better than any president ever in the history of this country\nOr the economy like I said today we had a white we reported a three point seven unemployment other presidents didn't even give a damn what the hell as long as they look good and the number was okay\nThey could walk out now called the ... then go and all the bull crap you know the bottom line here is ladies and gentlemen you have a president that gives a damn about you this country I told you this isn't your regular everyday guy\nGo look this guy up when he was going to school this guy was a leader in school uh he was a leader on the field or into leader he's a born leader to lead this country it is the proof is right before your eyes\nOn a daily basis he doesn't back down that's why the American people we'd been waiting for a guy like this to fight for us for how long\nYou know nobody the Democrat Party doesn't even know how to handle somebody like this they ... it's the same thing like I told you out now or soda you throw a commercial on about Christ in cinema and she couldn't\nLine here is ladies and gentlemen you have a president that gives a damn about you this country I told you this isn't your regular everyday guy go look this guy up when he was going to school this guy was a leader in school\nUh he was a leader on the field\nA he's a leader he's a born leader to lead this country\nIs that the proof is right before your eyes on a daily basis he doesn't back down that's why the American people we've been waiting for a guy like this to fight for us for how long\nYou know nobody the Democrat Party doesn't even know how to handle somebody like this they want it's the same thing like I told you out in Arizona\nYou throw a commercial on about Christ in cinema and she couldn't handle it right for the first couple of weeks but now they've overcame that commercial\nAnd they have no new commercials and that's why you have to play these people like you are from losing from the behind\nAll the tone you see how they play there is no rules there is no regulation they go for the throat from minute one\nAnd so they got beat they got they went and killed by the last second you saw the protesters\nWalking in the building right and they were still they were still out there moaning and crying\nYou\nAmerican people have to realize one thing\nI'd rather just told J. D.\nV. d.s they're only going to get rough or they're only going to get tougher that's all they have left\nThe race baiting isn't working anymore okay the race baiting doesn't work anymore it's weakening the women isn't working because most women out there like I said earlier\nAre independent and they wanted their strong and they want to be independent they're not there to depend on somebody but what the Democrat Party wants to do to the woman is the great her as they do the man today\nRight if you're the man he's the one the bad guy they want to make a man sound like it's in the cave man days where you grab your wife and your drag around the damn house which is bull crap I told you guys how many times bigger women run the facility ...\nOf the house most houses you go to the woman who's running the show the man gets up he goes to work the wife even at the white ... are the some of the family they both go to work the wife still runs the show\nAnd you can go to most families and that's just the way it really is and there's no problem with that I'm not telling you about what they're trying to do is weakening the woman and what happened here is they were reputed the\nWomen can email\nAnd they ... I'm sure the calls that went to all these senators I'm sure that Seventy five eighty percent of the calls that went to these people were from women\nBecause you know like I said this stuff but they pull witness rape and this and that made a lot to do that hurt the women so what a woman actually is a salted\nOr actually is rate nobody's gonna listening they're going to call her a liar due to the Democrat Party you know so you see what's going on the tide is changing I'll be right back\nClose this mad house down\n[laughter]\nHappening here is they were required at the women going out\nAnd open your the calls that went to all be whether there's I'm sure it's Seventy five eighty percent of the calls that went to meet people work rubber women\nBecause you know\nLike like that it's stuck with the poll with the rate at that age that I wrote the women so what a woman actually is salted or actually is rate nobody's gonna look what they're going to call her a liar you said the Democrat Party you know\nSo you see what's going on the tide is changing I'll be right back\nTo close its madhouse down\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nHi this is a good man from the talking one rock and radio show joined the talking one rock and radio shows seem\nSponsorship advertisements for beyond the show called the talking one rocket radio show promoter Mr ran for you know four or five Ninety six five one nine ... nine to five one I joined the number one show on Saturday Night talking one on one radio show\nFor it you know four or five Ninety six five one nine [noise]\nAnd your political Iran not talking one rock and radio show Saturday nights from seven to ten pm on camera and I live in a hundred years most opposing political news on and not targeting one rocket and review shows\nPopular than rocket than anybody else if you like the ... the man to make special appearances present structure locations where these corporate talk among locking radio shows main office that for eight or six to eight to not be five for email the talking one rock and radio show and Gmail dot com\nAlso for any of these people running for political position to be men can teach you how to win that you're appointed now\nTakes us up to ... and you would\nCall for you to all the way the country by the ... to ... take care of business now\nMy near living history museum off the Seventeen and pioneer road just north of the carefree highway with\nOne of the most of the rest of collections of frontier buildings is an old new house and much more families have the opportunity to sit back in time in Miami Arena was all about even wild man don't fight reenactment becomes the Ninety years on how it was in the Eighteen hundreds in Arizona\nFor more information go to W.

do they say well look we saw this testimony\nWe believed Ford and we believed Kavanaugh also\nAnd so what really makes the difference wrote does the FBI find cooperation are not well what we find in the polling is that sixty percent said well look there's no collaboration them in fact the nomination should be confirmed\nAnd that included eighty six percent of Republicans Democrats or do you look Democrats even after there is no cooperation sixty percent of Democrats [noise] you know would oppose the nomination but you see that sort of the center\nOf the country says hey if I could see that there is no cooperation I'm going to be fair here I'm not going to ruin a this guy's life on the basis of two people who testified who I think are fair if there's no collaboration and that's certified by the FBI\nThe Atlantic has a piece out um here's why white women are abandoning the G O P A new evidence suggests that many of the women may now agree ah and they were made some joke about Tina Fey um who took\nWhite women to task after the Trump election who helped him get elected providing him with fifty two percent of their support\n... faith focused her remarks on college educated white women\nForty four percent home of whom voted for Trump saying chastising them for wanting to go back to watching HGTV and forget about the election you can't look away she said well now a it looks like some women are taking that to heart\nA morning console political poll found that President Trump net support\nAmong Republican women had dropped by Nineteen points\nWell that's a huge drop if that's if that translates into people voting for the Democrat Party that could be a disaster for the ... the\nI think that is the the biggest\n... both change in the electorate concern for the

are taking that to heart a morning console political poll found that President Trump net support among Republican women had dropped finite teen points\nWell that's a huge drop if that's if that translates into people voting for the Democrat Party that could be a disaster for the G A pie\nBut I think that is the the biggest\nBut both change in the electorate concern for the Republicans and and victory points for the Democrats so far which is that the closet what I Would say the closet conservatives in the country are actually independent suburban women\n[noise] who voted twenty points for Romney who voted probably Thirteen fourteen points for ah for for President Trump\nA and they've been up for grabs I think the Democrats than making very good kind of momentum with them I don't think\nThis cabinet nominations never help that I always thought that a woman nominated who even the woman nominee what might have been more conservative [noise] what would actually have been the right strategic choice here\nI I think the Republicans have held on to the working class voters Trump took but those are the voters are up for grabs and I don't see anything coming out of the Republicans to win them back\nYeah well the again you would think the economy which is of course on fire women care about prosperity and security and all those issues that Trump is\nFocused on 'em but nevertheless at twenty September twenty six\nUs see uh LA Times poll\nCounted twenty per ... percent point advantage for Democrats among all women a twenty eight percent advantage among married white college educated woman women a group along tied to the G O P the Republican now lead by only five points they had a much bigger\nA much bigger lead among that group of women before but now those are low as well um this is this is a substantial block or the married\nCollege educated women that's a substantial block but among all women I mean I I think a lot of this might be tone you know Trump's tone women like things calm they're like things to be calm down\nAnd I think that they they sense that things are chaotic and they seem to be blaming the Republicans for that maybe the stuff for the last couple of weeks might change that I don't know\nBut they're also more skeptical about the economic progress if you look men are like wow this economy is through the roof women whom as you rightly pointed out typically are even more concerned about the economy\nAnd its effect on them and their family or less understanding of an improved economy and that's another area where the Republicans are really fail to drive their message clicked every day every day that the the national question is is she\nA rapist or not\nThere's a day that do but he's focusing on the economy I mean you've seen the last day or two incredible jobs numbers come out and the focus is primarily you know on the cabinet issue and it's going to stay that way at least through you know middle of next week probably\nYeah and that's um I think that's why I'm Mitch McConnell wants to vote to happen as soon as possible this is what my barnacles said this morning on MSNBC let's listen\nA lot of Republicans have come home and the state of Florida and the Gillum race he was comfortably ahead you can go to other states than show again the races are tightening in do you think that perhaps Donald Trump did the data that shows that this is driving conservative and conservative voting base\nSo really failed to drive their message clicked every day every day that the ... the national question is is she a rapist or not\nIs a day that do but he's focusing on the economy I mean you've seen the last day or two incredible jobs numbers ... come out and the focus is primarily you know on the cabinet issue and it's

the races are tightening in do you think that perhaps Donald Trump did the data that shows that this is driving conservative and conservative voting base\nUp back home of course he didn't do plays exactly to Donald Trump strength the one thing he is an expert in is resentment and specifically in this case\nWhite male resentment\nMale resentment um I think the white privilege discussion is driving even more men now to the Republican Party I think people are really getting tired of this identity politics I'm Mark I I think that the Democrats have gone way too far on that\nFor ... as you do a for a long time I I've been against both class warfare an identity politics as a as a moderate Democrat\nYou know I've always been against those two in favor of kind of the right kind of you know social policies and balance I think what's really happening here\nIs that the Democrats were completely energize\nThey were looking for an opportunity to vote against Trump and the Republicans without a leader without a particular message we're incredibly disorganized and I do think this thing has awakened the Republican base you know in a in a way that it's backfiring on the Democrats unfortunately\nUh [noise] I think they still have an edge but I think they probably could have had a wipe out the way this thing was heading and and now I think you can see it kind of a balance among turn out here because the stakes of this election have been just raised you know so high now\nYeah and I I Do think that again you see what the Republicans are capable of when they stand United with the exception of the\nThree I'm more liberal Republicans who you know are are dragging their feet on the on the nomination or the party when it's United it's pretty formidable I mean even a bunch of older white [laughter] that's a pretty formidable ... never seen Mitch McConnell so\nYou know so good as he's been in the last week just as a political matter\nWell but see that's ironic thing that I get sick you really see this in the Senate races and I think you see a lot of the Senate races\nTightening up because the Republicans are coming home and there's no question that this is Kevin ... is a highly partisan ice vote and if you're in a state that voted forty courts for Trump you know there's no question that it's going to be a large percentage more way above a majority that would want to see in front of us are in the Senate this has\nDone a lot I think for the Republicans you know in the house you know not so much you know Ryan quit his job at the end didn't leave there's no leadership there is no message we're we're McConnell or as you say has stepped up maybe some people think leaving some people\nYou know what I think too harshly but as you said he stepped up he's got the message leading in the house there's nothing\nI have to run or less it's right or left and it said Paul Ryan should have left if he's going to retire should've left to let this thing it'd be taken

aggressively and make sure the people who pulled that uh have to be held to account if you if we just getting a crouch\nAnd let them keep doing it to us there won't be any us left because no good people will want to get into politics\nWell and I I really mean that is not just someone from coming from someone who supported the president a in a campaign but coming from a a lawyer and a longtime conservative like myself I really believe Trump sought the Republican how to fight\nI mean it's not going to simple formulation but for a long time Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they were all just like they were also like in an elevator on any longer I've never seen Mitch McConnell fight harder than he fought for the nomination\nIt well I think he's showing Trump is showing that this is what people have one at all along and look at this sometimes to the president I think goes way overboard and makes me cringe but if I go into my head if I have to pick\nI Want somebody who's going to fight than somebody who's not and if that means is going to be accessed from time to time then you know then there's going to be access from time to time\nBut I think he's showing that

Lindsey Graham John Cornyn or even been fast talking about the mob mentality that we can't become a ... a country by a mob rule where people are afraid to go to restaurants\nYep [noise] yeah and I and I think Laura that if you don't raise the stuff\nAnd turn it into an issue particularly one more on the cusp of an election\nYou don't have a compelling way after the election to say that you know this was on the table for people to consider and you have a mandate now to stop it because people have voted against it so I think this not only has to be fought but it has to be heat up\nA as an election issue and frankly it helps the Republicans to take it up because\nI I've seen you say this ... you know on television and heard you on the radio said a million times ordinary people commonsense people do not like the stuff I mean they see these these uh Lenski I direct\nAction tactics and they say you know I there are some parts of this agenda that I may agree with but these tactics are not America and and I don't think that's the America anybody wants who sensible\nNow and again people like Feinstein so let's see the liberal but she was fairly well respected until I

sorry again I'm Sorry and you hold that thought Joe mansion just voted yes for cloture then I think Joe mansion he thinks he's is Santa Cruz over on the bus yes go ahead sorry go ahead and to\nYou know I I Would just have to ask the smart political people is there someone that we can get done before the midterms and if there's not that I think you have to double down on Kavanaugh on say\nYou know if if you vote Republican and we get we get a a majority in the Senate or then we're going to nominate\nCat the cat and all over again you know turn it into an election issue but I don't know the

eight nine twenty six forty six\nEight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six did you do simply spending cash today is enough to get your brand it as a potential criminal yard me you better read

and thrive by reading the secret war on cash it's free if you call eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six right now\nSo\nI asked a couple of questions one was what the ... or tell us about bearing false witness against my neighbor which of course was banned by the\nJewish people in the Old Testament banned in the Christian Bible but it's not been by Charles Schumer and Dianne Feinstein in fact the entire Democratic Party seems to be run on a\nThe tenant that you know by all means necessary that's a tentative communism pulling WABC is calling he claims to be a Muslim are you really a Muslim poll\nOh no but I just I'm sort of caught I justify have five ... I Know what they say and the\nWater's look around and say about bearing false witness against neighbor\nThat it's very thin for if you're a labor is the answer though you are blessed by out of the study will show you\nMean if if you're not a non Muslim you can lie about them with with impunity\nNow if you are and more flavor in that\nCase I I got it now if you're a Muslim and you make up false charges against an enemy who's not Muslim that's okay\nThat's fine if you are blessed by\nNow but what does it say electrical let's stick to the other point one if a Muslim the same as another Muslim with false testimony what's the crime\nPunishment for this way if that ... or the ... is a woman who is being raped for instance you need for\nMan or a mosque flames mean they all have site on his fate or in order to have a case of the ways that ... to ...\nYou know I Know the woman is a second class citizen in motion um traditional Muslim society there's no question about it but what does the Koran say about burying false witness is what I'm trying to figure out\nFor this and not bad though it's good if if they do it again for another ...\nYeah so but what does the punishment\nWe don't know what what do you have to drive in Nineteen sixty five Volkswagen for the rest of your life\nBut I don't like what are what will have to look it up a shelter I ... I can verify that\nUh we got great cause I'm not I'm not groping there's no grope\nThere's no grow up I think I Need to lighten it up a bit we played Obama from a one way he says I was uh\nMan a mosque flames mean on a site on his fate or in order to have a case or the white with a ...\nYou know I Know the woman is a second class citizen in most um traditional Muslim society there's no question about it but what does the ... say about burying false witness is what I'm trying to figure out\nFor the bad stuff good if if they do it again and other mosques yeah so but what does the punishment\nWe don't know what what do you have to drive in Nineteen sixty five Volkswagen for the rest of your life\nBut I like what are what will have to look it up a self I ... I can verify that\nUh we got great cause I'm not I'm not groping there's no grope\nThere's no growth I think I Need to lighten it up a bit we played Obama from a one way he says I was a thug\nI did illegal drugs I drank drank six packs before going to school and somehow that didn't stop him from becoming a president\nWhile I've been waiting to do this I have I've just taken the salts to avoid the same thing\nHere is my favorite gal\nDianne Feinstein today on the FBI report listed they're complaining she didn't get a chance to read and listen to her out to ten years later\nWhen we review today and I'm In a very limited time I was there I had\nTo leave her eyes so his ... his heart and\nI had the opportunity to read some but not all of it it looks to the prime of an incomplete investigation well hold on wait a minute you didn't have time to read it\nBut you know it's in complete a the reporters incomplete\nSo here she is against first she destroys a man publicly now she acts like clean old Diane\nAnd uh it's it's an incomplete report\nAnd although the Democrats agree that the investigation should be limited they didn't say should be limited actually they should that should be limited but not really limited and the way you know\nSo now they're saying the reports incomplete and it's not a legitimate report listen to the next one in the next clip you know\nThree Democrats agreed that the investigations so should be limited to not agree that the White House should tie\nThe FBI handle only not\nPublic testimony in last spring is a substitute for interviews by FBI agent ... sack of dirty clothing you\nKavanaugh has been subjected to three FBI investigations along\nThe road to becoming a federal judge how many investigations have applied to Dianne Feinstein or Charles Schumer [noise] for the alleged ties between another senator and radical Islam\nHow many FBI investigations count them zero [noise]\nSo yes America has made up its mind they definitely have seen the enemy\nThe conservative judge that we want cabin or if he gets in\nIs going to shock you with his votes especially now he's a weekend but they didn't hit was weaken him for even if he gets appointed there'll be afraid of his own shadow\nWhy what Trump with twenty five choices you know twenty five people nominated him to be put up for the Supreme Court vote the only chose\nThis guy a Bush man no less a Bush man not from the collar hurry but from\nThe Bush administration a Bush fan of\nWhy didn't pick cabinet or liberal judge to begin with\nLook look what he got with this guy nothing but what heartache why didn't he picks the woman judge\nWho was more qualified than Mr cabin or\nDo you think they would have subjected this woman to the same thing they did the cabinet no because she's a woman they couldn't have accused of rape or sexual harassment laws they could've says well she's not qualified because she's a you know pro life\nThat wouldn't have stopped that so book so and in many ways Trump fell right into their hands into the LA no you don't want to believe that many of you under the false assumption that he knows everything nobody knows everything he's just a man like you\nVery bright great memory very strong we support him but he's just a man never forget that\nSo he made a mistake and picking cabinet amongst the twenty five so that becomes the next question for the political thriller called Savage Nation\nWho is in his inner circle who steered Trump to picking cabinet over all the other judges so far is that oh no one's asked this question accept me for the last three weeks\nAnd I think it's a combination of the old guard in the federalist society as well as a certain individual in his inner circle\nWho likes to display herself in front of men\nOn a fairly regular basis\nOh yeah there's someone in there who I have really bad feelings about when I was ushered into the president's\nAh the oval office of the time I visited a high point in my life it's a big moment I'll never be invited back I understand that I had my one thirty ... thirty minutes and having in political heaven\nAnd it was a great honor it will be a great honor it's something I Will always remember\nMy grand child will not know about it grandpa went to the oval office there's the picture of him and the president that's great stuff whether you like it or not it doesn't matter it's a big deal to sit at that desk\nThe great resolution desk from the great resolution worship you didn't sit there or you markets in Santa Rosa\nOr you failed lawyers and retired doctors you're drug addicts you you were never there when Obama was there so it's a big deal to me\nOh yeah there's someone in there who I have really bad feelings about when I was ushered into the president's\nAh the oval office at the time I visited a high point in my life it's a big moment I'll never be invited back I understand that I had my one thirty ... thirty minutes and having in political having\nIt was a great honor it will be a great honor it's something I Will always remember\nMy grand child will know about it grandpa went to the oval office there's the picture of him and the president that's great stuff whether you like it or not it doesn't matter it's a big deal to sit at that desk\nThat great resolution desk from the great resolution more should you didn't sit there or you markets in Santa Rosa\nOr you failed lawyers and retired doctors you're drug addicts you you were never there when Obama was there so it's a big deal to me\nBut I'll never forget that when I was ushered in by the general\nA certain creature flew out it was almost like a bird of prey flying out of the office she was the last one in there\nBefore I met the president she flew right by me like a like a dark thing flew by me\nLike almost made a squawking sound as as she flew by my question is the shame push it\nShe and her people along with the federalist society the neo cons in order to set Trump for fall I don't know who did this\nThis is not even a cabin or gets in\nThis horrible horrible horrible experience for America is something we could have avoided had have chosen amongst the twenty five choices the woman judge who was equally if not more qualified so who is it in his inner circle\nWho is probably a the leaker and be the the the steer the ... of the ship\nIn the wrong direction or we'll never know\nWe can't know those things were just a little people\nWell that's a good question I just raise and I don't have an answer for it I'll be honest with you I Wish I did but I actually ... that's all I have\nThey really should hire me to be the inside of eyes and ears of that place alone man oh yeah but I wouldn't take the job anyway\nI don't want to live in Washington the thought of wearing a suit every day is enough to stop me from doing anything\nThe thought of taking off my sandals and wearing shoes prevents me from taking a regular gig anywhere on earth and the guy said to me I Want you to be the head and the other day I turned him down the thought of it can you imagine living in Washington DC let's say I buy a big house there or whatever\nAnd let's say I

R. P. M. C. P. A. I have a masters in tax\nI'm a registered investment advisor so really all I Do is talk about money all day long and I've been talking to my clients about this release for years and the thing that I Would talk to them about what's going on with the federal government wanting the largest line item on the federal government is the interest\nAnd then the interest rates have been very very very low um\nHere still have six seven eight hundred billion dollars of deficits which I had to explain to my clients the government was not bringing in enough money in taxes to pay the bill which included the interest which meant they had to borrow money to pay the interest\nWhere are you talking about our government now under Donald Trump\nThis is just this is federal only yes this is\nAll the way I Want to get this clear just saying our government right now is is printing money to such an extent that they have to borrow money to pay the interest\nYeah every time there's a news article where there's a deficit the deficit means they are not bringing in enough revenue to pay the bill and wondering\nSo in other words wait wait let me just summarize for the people who are listening\nWe complain bitterly under Obama and the liberals when they taxed and spent we said all the Democrats stand for tax and spend well now we have an administration that stands for spending spent today on one hand cut taxes and they spend more than Obama did and you're saying that the the dislocation is so great that what's gonna happen is what I Want to know\nWell I Will tell you when I was talking to my clients and they would say so what does that mean I Would say if you want to see what you're going to work like look at grief to anybody now with Greece look like as an economic\nMoney to such an extent that they have to borrow money to pay the interest\nYup every time there's a news article where there are the deficit the deficit means they are not bringing in enough revenue to pay the bill and want to\nDo so in other words we would let me just summarize for the people that were listening\nWe complain bitterly under Obama and the liberals when they tax and spend we should all the Democrats stand for tax and spend well now we have an administration that stands for spending spent today on one hand cut taxes and they spend more than Obama dead and you're saying that the the dislocation is so great that what's gonna happen is what I Want to know\nWell I Will tell you so when I was talking to my clients and they would say so what does that mean I Would say if you want to see what it's going to work like look at Greece to anybody now with Greece looks like as an economic powerhouse\nNo tell us what what was it a more weight how 'bout on our own hemisphere how bout of Venezuela could we go as bad as that\nYeah they're all the same I mean here's your economic inequities when you're just not paying your bills and you're borrowing in your buttering and you're borrowing eventually it has a real economic consequences\nSo why don't the wise men around Donald Trump tell him about this like missed the call on why don't they tell them that\nWell I understand the real world of politics and I understand that the politicians first job is just to get reelected and I do not understand is don't these politicians have children don't they understand the world that they are creating for their children that's\nWhat I thought what is that what is the world that's being created right now what will it look like give us give us if there's a an economic severe economic downturn what does it look like\nI don't want to go as a as a volatiles riot but you you actually reach a point where people have had enough and\nThey're going to be there had been bread riots in history in our own country we had riots over food when we had the great depression there were riots people starving in this country\nWhere I can tell you what's gonna happen and probably in in ... in the short term is people don't understand how Social Security works\nThere is no real savings account and Social Security or money just goes into the general account and then when the benefits are paying it comes down to the general accounting right when Social Security was first started you at a Lebanese people paying the benefits\nFor the one beneficiary now you have about two and a half people working to pay the benefits of the beneficiaries and one of the what what\nUh what about all the people faking disability on on the disability racket in America what about all the drug addicts about what about all the oxycontin addicts don't work who's paying for all of this we are the taxpayer that's\nTotally if you take a look at the statistics so who is actually paying taxes for the very interesting statistic about\nThem the ... the tax money where the the left is talking that they want the rich people to pay more taxes but if you look at the statistics the rich the top five percent\nAre paying more as a percentage of the federal tax revenue for paying more now than they did Twenty years ago\nThat's right and the top one percent and that way and the top one percent which is everybody in the media\nThey make that mistake about it all these wild left this during the top zero one percent are paying most of the taxes and the country that's if they're paying legitimately and I can't speak for anyone else I Will tell you right now I'm paying more taxes on the Trump's tax plan that I did before the you know that living in California\nWell let me tell you\nTaxes went up in other words under Donald Trump ...\nThe ... the tax money where the the left is talking that they want the rich people to pay more taxes but if you look at the statistics three at the top five percent\nAre paying more as a percentage of the federal tax revenue for paying more now than they did Twenty years ago\nThat's right and the top one percent and that way and the top one percent which is everybody in the media\nTo make that mistake about it all these wild left this during the top zero one percent are paying most of the taxes of the country that's if they're paying legitimately and I can't speak for anyone else I Will tell you right now I'm paying more taxes on the Trump's tax plan that I did before at the you know that living in California\nWell let me tell you\nTaxes went up in other words under Donald Trump's so called tax plan as a Californian it doesn't matter that I'm a conservative\nOr a libertarian whenever you wanted to find me as do try to find me I I Wish you good luck I'm paying more on that Donald Trump's tax plan that I did under Obama's did you know that\nYeah well it's really I guess the biggest and so is every one in New York even if they are concerned right wing because because you cannot deduct state taxes from federal any more\nMoney since fifty percent of the population doesn't even work\nAnd another large percentage are illegal aliens who pay no taxes and people don't even care\nThe underground economy is so big right now people don't even know anything about these things but the so called tax plan that was supposed to be a great salvation for me as a California a is such that I'm paying more taxes than I did before did you know that there's anyone who really you're not allowed to say anything about it oh hush hush don't say that\nAnyone in New York is that what I'm Talking about any ... any of the those of you listening to the show or fiscal conservatives who are paying more than you did under Obama because I Know you are you can already ducked your New York state\nTaxes your state taxes from your federal tax is you know that whereas we couldn't have passed All right I I see the same thing the handwriting is on the wall it's not a very very pretty picture and I tried to tell you this with a history not an allegory I talked about\nThe ah rhyme our republic\nWhere the model corruption\nOffended most Germany's Germans\nBut they couldn't do anything about it and the long came a after the people with civil hungry\nAnd the violence or the left got too great for them\nAs we now have with on the fire and the Occupy people with the masks who are beating up Republicans chasing senators chasing right wing or as they say calling anyone who they disagree with a fascist there will be\nThere will be the equivalent of what happened in Germany in this country as sure as I'm sitting here\nYou may not think it's going to happen I Believe the underground there's already bubbling up to the surface and it will happen and when the political assassinations start from the left which they boasting about two weeks ago do you remember what they said on the phone\nThey published a statement saying we want you to go out during the day and make believe you for the country for each other and for the common good but at night put on your masks and kill those political opponents kill

winning syndicated columnist historian author and speaker Mr Bruce how're you doing buddy\nI'm doing fine though you know I'm living in a town that's going crazy right now\nWell I Know it has they're bursting all over I mean we've gone through this and I think this is where America that is there there's been so much I had explosive they're hitting the belt way it's like oh please let's get this rec over with some\nVery very much and that's I think going to happen fairly soon I think we will probably have a boat on the Kavanaugh nomination by the weekend Saturday maybe yeah but we know they're happy I report is out to be in demand for a Chuck Grassley the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee he'll be looking at it\nDianne Feinstein will be looking at it and then the rest of the committee will take a look at it and I and I think we'll probably know what it says by around midday today\nYeah I mean the leaks will come flying out you know that\n[noise] and um you know we'll see what they've done there's a we've already got a problem with the you know one or a democratic or I don't know where the storm or a former staff member not who um you know send out the addresses of ah three Republicans on the Senate\nOr not good I mean this is this thing has just exploded and we've lost all manner of demeanor have we know\nWe have and one of the problems is bill is one of the reason I mean if you remember while they're two things one it it didn't used to be like it's not on Supreme Court nominations not on the Supreme Court hearings they were usually pretty much\nPro forma state affairs ... but the problem now is that the stakes are so much higher because of the Supreme Court if even I have discussed has involved itself in so many issues that it has no business involving itself in\n... so the argument made the confirmation hearing the argument between Democrats or Republicans over Kevin ... is basically the Democrats fear that once you\nYou know one or a democratic ah I don't know where the storm or a former staff member not who um you know send out the addresses of ah three Republicans on the Senate or not good I mean this is this thing has just exploded and we've lost all manner of demeanor have we not\nWe have and one of the problems is bill is one of the reason I mean if you remember while there are two things one it it didn't used to be like it's just not on Supreme Court nominations not on the Supreme Court hearings they were usually pretty much\nPro forma state affairs ... but the problem now is that the stakes are so much higher because of the Supreme Court if you and I have discussed has involved itself in so many issues that it has no business involving itself and\nSo the argument at the confirmation hearing the argument between Democrats or Republicans over Kavanaugh is basically the Democrats fear that once he's on the court roe v Wade may be overturned\nExactly certainly roe v Wade was an issue that the Supreme Court no court should have been involved in All right the number one there's no language in the constitution that says anything about abortion there's no language in the constitution says anything

a word winning syndicated columnist historian author and speaker\nVersus you break it down the um the a report as supposed to stay in the confines only one report is there from the FBI or the senators will alternate\nAnd uh I'm sure in short order 'em because the Democrats can't help themselves or we'll we'll hear about the report but what we've heard so far is that um you know this is the seventh\nOr inquiry seventh background check of judge Kavanaugh and ... there is no um ... you know no bombs expected out of this and so I'm McConnell is already a announced closure on this so that means that they will ah go\nFlights [laughter] Nineteen Minutes after the top of the hour British confidence is still with us or we're winning syndicated columnist historian author and speaker\nVersus you break it down um it'd be a report as supposed to stay in the confines only one report is there from the FBI or the senators will alternate\nAnd I'm sure in short order 'em because the Democrats can't help themselves will will hear about the report but what we've heard so far is that um you know this is the seven's\nA inquiry seventh background check a judge Kavanaugh and there is no um you know no bombs expected out of this and so I'm McConnell is already\nA announced closure on this so that means that they will ah go on a vote but before the vote there will be a hearty debate thirty hours Bruce you had already more hours of Spartacus moments and God Knows what [laughter]\nI don't know if I can handle it\nUh yeah there you know yeah\nThat yeah it's absolutely true actually actually you know it's interesting it's very unusual for the FBI to conduct a background check after the guys testified before the committee\nAnd if you know there were six investigation background checks when Kavanaugh prior\nTo um earrings and they found nothing ... zero right though I mean I'm not too worried about this this this next one but as I as I've written before the problem that Kavanaugh has right now is that he's not in a court of law\nRight if the court of law this case would have been thrown out\nWithin the first before the judge just sat down to hear exactly right\nBut we but this is this is basically he is not independent or right and the senators are not jurors and therefore we're not in a court of also read beyond a reasonable doubt preponderance of evidence and bars do not have to be met the only it's almost it's like a job interview in which the senators can decide okay\nI got the wavering centers will ... will say okay you know I was thinking about voting for um the NBA hasn't highly qualified even the ACLU Adam highly qualified\nBut this team may may may have been guilty of what these being accused of so I'm I I'm I I Can't take that chance putting on the court and bears the issue\nAnd you know so\nUm [noise] you know like you and I both know no evidence no concrete proof has been has been produced no cooperating witnesses have been produced but in the long run that doesn't\nMatter because senators number one will vote on how their constituents want them to vote their elected representatives so somewhere around half of the Senate if his constituents are considered liberal and they don't want cabin on the court for the very reasons you and I just discussed\nSo there's that political considerations and then all the wavering senators are going to say OK yeah he's not been proven guilty but maybe it happened and they're more I might vote against him that well issue\nThink maybe you know because we know there's lots of signs around these days and maybe one of the biggest science should be the statements from his mother\nHis mother made a if you remember ... you know he said that ah when they would be at the dining table or one of the things she would hold too in her concluding statements to the jury is that\nYou know that which is reasonable uh ... you should consider as being reasonable and that which is a reasonable\n... you know in in ... in so many words I'm paraphrasing of course you're saying exactly but you know what I meant him when he was talking a when his mother was talking about this as an attorney herself and I think that some of these are the U.S senators would be well served by considering what is reasonable I mean here is a guy\nGuilty but maybe it happened and they are and where I might vote against them that well issue\nI think maybe you you know because we know there's lots of signs around these days and maybe one of the biggest science should be the statements from his mother\nHis mother made a if you remember ... you know he said that ah when they would be at the dining table or one of the things she would hold too in her concluding statements to the jury is that\nYou know that which is reasonable uh ... you should consider as it being reasonable and that which isn't reasonable and you know in in ... in so many words I'm paraphrasing of course here I'm not saying it exactly but you know what I meant to him when he was talking a when his mother was talking about this as an attorney herself\nAnd I think that some of these uh a U.S senators would be well served by considering what is reasonable\nI mean here is a guy if he was in dastardly as he was as being an alleged here\nUm you know how would he have retained to the level of\nYou know educational excellence a is an athletics I mean as a human being if he was so off target I think it's unreasonable\nTo you know kind of connect the dots in such a manner or based on these accusations and this is the dangerous part about the court of public opinion due process is out the window\nAnd there's no due process you are guilty and that's it and and it's not you're guilty until proven innocent you're guilty 'cause there's no way you can improve yourself venison 'cause I got a fixed in my mind that you're guilty which is you know again just like the hyperbole\nThat Senator Kennedy used years ago on board it's that same hyperbole that comes up again and you're going wait a minute\nHaven't we learn from all this over the years or\nYou know it it's okay for um senators and our elected officials to be this so did you know show disconnected from reason and decency that you would just spew words and accusations so ear responsibly\nYes absolutely and you're absolutely right if he was such a drunk or anything it was such a rowdy guy how did he graduated top of his class in high school how did he go to the Yale how did he go to Yale Law school and how did he get the position he is the second highest court in a land right now so yeah although it's funny I Know there and the Democrats are trying to say this guy that you know\nI mean I I think many of them are thinking okay we're not really making a lot of headway on this you know all these women accusing him because there's no proof but the guy with a beer drinker and he was routing guy in high school and\nSo maybe that's the reason why when I read that the first thing I thought a with a blinking when told of Ulysses Grant was drunk and Lincoln said already find out what are you drinking and send the case of it to all my other general [laughter]\n\nI Want what he is drink and then of\nCourse for them to really really in general and ran most about going into other generals were not doing the job so I mean I I just throw that out there it's kind of an amusing side but yeah okay so he is not we're not the Senate that even when we were putting out as I mentioned we've got beyond reasoned debate debate and\nWe'd gone beyond reasoned debate and that's really sad and the reason we've gone beyond the reasoned debate is because the stakes are so high now because the court involving itself in so many issues that affect all of us but it shouldn't be that the court should not be involved\nAnd the thing is happening also is the redefinition of our language I'm\nThe term credible his been hijacked inappropriately especially in this case credibility wants to be assigned or they want to assign credibility to a person\nOf that is not credible by definition credibility is based on the facts and evidence but you know just because somebody gives a passionate play you can say well pretty convincing uh\nSo he is not yeah there were not the Senate even when we were putting out as I mentioned we've got beyond reasoned debate debate and\nWe'd gone beyond reasoned debate and that's really sad and the reason we've gone beyond the reason tomatoes because the stakes are so high now because the court involving itself in so many issues that affect all of us ... but it shouldn't be that the court should not be involved\nAnd and the thing is happening also is the redefinition of our language I'm of the term credible his been hijacked inappropriately especially in this case credibility wants to be assigned or they want to assign credibility to a person\nOf that is not credible by definition credibility is based on the facts and evidence but you know just because somebody gives a passionate play you can say well pretty convincing a but is that person credible based on the words that they speak\nAnd especially when there's no evidence or not or you know she's offered names offered you know some information but it doesn't line up you know from hey I'd get claustrophobia I don't like to fly when she's flying all over the place\nUm you know I didn't have anybody or give me any council whatsoever about uh taking a polygraph nor have I ever given anybody a training on how to give a polygraph and then we find out from the boyfriend here earlier this week oh in fact she has so\nYou know these things start crumbling down oh let's take a look I'm you know you're talking about his annual in and let's bring out her annual in as a one FBI Director says look at if you start bringing out angels\nThen you need to bring out everybody's annual so we take a look at her annual Z and uh they talk about uh the binge drinking that took place on her school which was an all girls' school and that was a big thing the girls would drink till they passed out that was in their annual\nAnd also mentioned that she you know drunk passed it got drunk passed I'd gotten a car accident\nOr you know show these things start to reveal themselves those things add credibility ah on on these specific issues but somebody's testimony in and of itself\nUm can be believable but not necessarily credible\nYeah that's a good point though because of your income port yourself in a very very very\nCommon and assured manner and and and and in the end for whatever you say is considered credible when it absolutely is not always will be that's point\nAnd another one okay so Kevin ... people are down on Kavanaugh because he got emotional it time for all right if Kavanaugh will well knows if his reputation has been incredibly damaged yes okay I mean he's now whether he's on the corner not his reputation has been damaged ... wherever that he's got two daughters who probably when they go to school there were other girls around their whispering\nDaddy if a sexual predator\nEither that for sure but I can certainly understand why you got a little bit emotional a little bit testing when exactly\nWhen you saw the cartoon writer you saw the court guided dark how disgusting [noise]\nWow ... ...

and dramatically and if I can\nThe ... I was on Social Security and I couldn't pay my own daughters parable and she had my two little grandbabies now I have three um she has three I actually has for my son just how little baby what not or

hundred dollars and what I didn't realize those like\nThis power bill has gone up significantly dramatically and it's going to continue to grow up significantly and dramatically and if I can help her pay this bill now\nAnd she can't have this bill we need to find a solution and I knew nothing about solar I didn't know how it worked I didn't know how much it cost and I wrote my sleeves up and I\nPeople don't understand better we are not rate what they can do what you want them to do but the electric companies won't let let them do that there's\nAlways a way that she can help people and it's all about education she wishes showing and I have to say that she was just showing me I'm somebody savings which is ... ... s R P A so after ... people YouTube she can help you as well\n[noise] four hundred and fifty nine dollars off of his son asked me to do the demand and over a thousand dollars off of his costs with us or pie and that he has a huge house and he has he builds but Fifteen hundred dollars in one month savings is huge and so um yeah ...\nThere's this thing called demand and ... um July and August\n... goes into super peak rates so you're instead of paying thirty one cents per kilowatt you're not paying between thirty six I'm thirty eight cents per kilowatt\nHow would you like to be paying between seven and eight cents per kilowatt\nOn your own roof and putting the difference in your pocket and that's exactly what I Do for my families that go\nOkay if there is to gas stations you're driving down the road one has gas for thirty eight cents and one has gas for seven cents well it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out who you turn your going to go to the seven cents gas station it's the same thing you now have an option to produce your own power and when you understand\nThat you're not writing a check it's approved credit there's no money out of pocket to do this\nSo you're going to pay you less per month then you're paying ...\nJust super peak rates so you're instead of paying thirty one cents per kilowatt you're not paying between thirty six I'm thirty eight cents per kilowatt\nHow would you like to be paying between seven and eight cents per kilowatt\nOn your own roof and putting the difference in your pocket and that's exactly what I Do for my family is that go\nOkay if there is to gas stations you're driving down the road one has

have an option to produce your own power and when you understand\nThat you're not writing a check it's approved credit there is no money out of pocket to do this\nSo you're going to pay you less per month then you're paying to the electric company\nSo where's the difference going it's going in your family's budget and households bank account\nAnd it's a simple as that and if we think that the rates rate the rate increases are going to stop here\nWere sorely sorely mistaken um there's ... mid term elections coming up in two thousand Eighteen solar is a big thing right now I'm a P has has been told that they have to produce a lot of renewable energy as does a therapy [noise]\nWhen they do that they are not going to pass those savings on you they're never lowering our power or our our electric rates they're just not it's not going to happen [noise]\nUm they will take these these different things that are passed into law to their favor so I educate my family is to take what's available to them now the federal tax credits the state tax credits and\nThe the panels are going to produce your pirates seven Seventy cents per kilowatt\nThere is no better benefits than saving money on your power costs and living more comfortable in your home no more than your thermostat at eighty eight when it's a hundred and Fifteen degrees up there you will be able to live very comfortably in your home and you'll have complete control over your power costs\nLetter come to you let her tell her show you how you can save money on a bill that you already are paying way too much money for all you have to do this which really simple she just has to have you go up on her website you'll fill out the kilowatt worksheet\nAnd it's very simple she will tell you exactly how much money that you can save then she comes to you she's going to show you how all the different things that she hasn't our tool box that it's going to help you even save more money I've got some new things that are coming out and it's going to\n... people who have pools and you have those old pool pump\nI have just been approached by a company to represent a solar pool pump that takes your pool

good stuff\nNo there is the part where death entered where God had created so much life God's enemy the devil the great liar into fever came to destroy that which God loves the most you see the devil cannot be God Newark take his place in fact when the devil tried God banished him and send him away from the heavenly places\nHating God as the devil guns though knowing his power lifter beating God one on one the devil targets God's crowning achievement seeking to hurt God by hurting those he loves\nIt she did with the first man and woman in the garden the devil continues telling lies that we can be like God creators of our own destiny is that we should focus on what we want and try to get it at any cost don't worry be happy for that is what you see can trust me I can show you\nHow to get it once created in the image of God our lives got twisted in turned upside down and we're once we walk with God now are natural inclination is to walk to the beat of our own drum\nWhere before we would've seen the value when everyone who was created in God's image we now see them as a means you are an obstacle to our goals or simply inconveniences wars now exist among people tribes and nations as we seek to get our own wants Matt\nWe may lie and cheat or to be horribly of others to get the promotion we want or something else of value that we have placed the lives of others over\nWe may see those who are born with physical or mental challenges adds up less value than those born typical maybe we think there must be a curse from God at play there the parents must have done something wrong in their lives to be given such a great burden\nYet to think this way we'd be wrong the disciples were so you'd be in good company\nIn the gospel of John we recall the accounts of where Jesus killed the boring beggar didn't air travel they Jesus and the ... pass by and to a man who had been blind from birth and his disciples asked him rabbi who send this man or his parents\nMatt we may lie and cheat or speak portly of others to get the promotion we want or something else of value that we have placed the lives of others over\nWe may see those who are born with physical or mental challenges adds up less value than those born typical maybe we think\nThere must be a curse from God at play there the parents must have done something wrong in their lives to be given such a great burden yet to think this way we'd be wrong the disciples were\nSo you'd be in good company and the gospel of John we recall the accounts of where Jesus healed the boring beggar sitting there traveled de Jesus and the ... pass by and saw a man who had been blind from birth\nAnd his disciples asked him rabbi who send this man or his parents that he was born blind\nAnd Jesus answered it was not that this man send or his parents but that the works of God might be displayed in him\nThis account serves to show how wrong we may be in our thinking for this man had a God given purpose\nWhen a life is created when we are blessed with such a great gift we may see it as nearly inconvenient not worthy of having right now at this new life is in a way of the plans we have made for ourselves\nThroughout the world about fifty five sixty million God given lives are taken by abortion each year\nThe arguments for abortion range from not wanting to raise children with birth defects should those concede due to rape yet those cases are the absolute rarity among those who choose abortion\nTwisted in the devils lives as we are we may no longer see the value in lives created by God his children no less as worthy of protecting sin has caused us to become tolerant of seeing life at had been great value from the one who gives it\nDid it we are in our sinfulness we placed little value in lives that are no longer able to contribute to society or to us more rightly said\nWhat good could bring a disabled child into this world possibly bring what purpose does grandma or grandpa in their frail bodies offer or one with a disease that will keep them requiring chair for a long time stripping them of their ability to be active citizen\nEven though it was my actions that caused a life to be created my life isn't ready to share with another so I'll just make this problem go away it isn't really a life until it fully enters the world we hear today\nAnd until then we have a right to choose to do whatever we want with it\nWe need not look hard at a mirror to see how broken we are our thoughts may even shocked at the time looking at strangers seeing how their dresser are thinking of what little value they contribute judging their life and it's worth less than our own\nBut what if we are wrong what if our sitting written reason cannot be trusted and we were to give God the final say in our lives\nRemember how we were once created in his image\nOld that image has been shattered but it is helpful to see how our natural inclination to hold self value above all others in this world should be seen as a sign of sickness you see all were and are created in his image I'll be at a shattered remnants of it\nAnd God loves that so much that he wants that all would be saved and if he had value for all of us is so great even broken and since\nTime looking at strangers seeing how they are dresser are thinking of what little value they contribute judging their life as worth less than our own but what if we are wrong what if our sitting written reason cannot be trusted and we were to give God the final say in our lives\nRemember how we were once created in his image\nOh that image has been shattered but it is helpful to see how our natural inclination to hold self value above others in this world should be seen as a sign of sickness you see all were and are created in his image I'll be at a shattered remnants of it\nAnd God loves that so much that he wants to that all would be saved and if he hadn't value for all of us is so great even broken and sinful as we are there must be something ... each life that he grants to exist\nAnd therefore we have no business pronouncing a right to choose its existence or not and as Christians\nWe cannot be complacent about this issue we cannot claim to see ... by his words to be followers and to not speak out against the hatred towards his creation that exist today\nPro choice is sitting in God's throne and making decisions that only he should make euthanasia is also the same\nSure things are broken in this life and we can expect some tough stuff to enter our lives yet using evil for good as God does all lives how purpose\nWe may not see it as clouded as our eyes have become by swallowing the devils live but there is much to be gained by knowing the one true God as he is\nYou'd see God it's a servant king\nEach action is one that has meant to draw us into a deeper understanding of who he is and how valued hits creation needs to be seen thinking we know veterans you can control we'd be looking at an eternity of darkness death and torture in choosing the devil as whom we should follow\nYou had wanting none of that God in knowing how we could never perfect we fulfilled the laws that are best for us since his only be gotten on to the bus\nAnd with him living his most perfect life Jesus then traded his life for our dead ones ones that did serve nothing but God's wrath and separation from him\nJust see how loved you are you must see how enemies as we are God still loves us enough to provide the fix to show us that even our lives still hold precious value to him all lives do\nAnd when we begin to understand how we have a father who still loves us and want us in spite of our own effects maybe then we can see how his love extends to everyone everywhere and that they too are valued and deserve to know of his love also\nThose who God creates are no accident regardless of how they arrive in this world\nThe blessings that we may see and loving those lives that we may expect to be burdened are precious in the eyes of God\nThose who need our compassion and service are there to teach us and they exist as lives that we may grow in la by and that is the real gift\nGod grant is to learn of how we too may loud and in doing so may receive loving return\nFollowing him we can expect is sinful broken world to bring with it trials and hardships yet we are made stronger and blessed to be in closer communion with him trusting and he drives us into deeper understanding of his plan and purpose a myth\nAnd deserved to know of his love also those who God creates are no accident regardless of how they arrive in this world the blessings that we may see and loving those lives that we may expect you'd be burden are precious in the eyes of God\nThose who need our compassion and service are there to teach us and they exist as lives that we may grow in love by and that is the real gift\nGod grant to learn of how we too may love and in doing so may receive loving return\nFollowing him we can expect is sinful broken world to bring with it trials and hardships yet we are made stronger and blessed to be closer communion with him trusting as he draws us into deeper understanding of his plan and purpose amidst the chaos\nNow if you are listening and you have gone against that which God wish for you to have taking of life and now find yourself surrounded by the darkness of that decision and feeling the pain\nI encourage you not to hide in the shadows where the devil once you but instead to bring that to the one who loves you the most your lord and savior who seeks to save that center the last the broken\nThe one who's forgiveness knows no limits in seats to embrace you again in his love\nAmidst darkness storms in trials Jesus Says I Am with you always even to the end of the age and in that there is much to be thankful for\nThe life giver our lord and savior seats to give us life eternal in him he wants to share of his love that you would share his love with others also may we always think of God's created children however\nThey arrived in this world and wherever we find them in the age of the life\nThat's full of value and purposes God declares that's to be for behold children are\nA heritage from the lord the fruit of the room a reward me we thank the lord always for valuing our lives enough to save them but there was nothing greater to be thankful for today than a father who spared not even the life of his son to save ours\nAnd trusting in this most precious work of Christ we will arrive home again to share in a life that never ends\nSuited to free tickets to the fans

include all the fingerprints learn about the justification for a deadly force them so much more\nAgain you can get your concealed carry permit for Arizona will give you so many good reasons and the class\nAs to why they have this even though we are in a constitutional carry state or it's supposedly not required why not go the phones nine yards and exercise your right to freedom and that is indeed getting that particular permit\nAnd it is the person operating it and hopefully somebody will realize that some day we do but uh the knee jerk reaction to ban a certain type of a gun because

Tennessee no NRA members involved in or a didn't do that the\nNRA did not hand the guy the keys to the to the van up there\nAnd I just it just absurd and a ... so frustrating\nNo one has been let's let's talk about the tendency is to go on the waffle house I mean this is just so famous here's the man alleged to have walked into half naked or naked I mean even that's bizarre into a waffle house in the wee hours of the morning as people can read those who cross the Internet and on news wire\nServices and information he comes in he shoots people outside issues people inside runs away into the woods\nBut there's something more prolific about this just I don't know how foreign how deep you've gotten into this story but he was also corner I think either arrested or detained outside the White House\nAnd apparently some how his firearms and actually you should have been taken away the war but I heard a report that family members actually gave them back his firearms what where can you corroborate on that part of it after having been detained\nThat is true I mean if that's not a red flag I don't know what is right that that tried to climbed the fence at the White House\nThey ah they took his a ours which he lived in Illinois which was odd mhm uh his father promised that he would keep 'em as father gave him back to him for some strange reason because you can't out think a crazy\nPerson that's what\nThe anti gun people don't understand they don't think like you and I he drives to a waffle house in Tennessee why NATO waffle house in Illinois who knows what is modeled mind was thinking\nAbsolutely uh\nYou know there's some lessons in here we also talk about self defense wants to the person the athletic looking person saw an opening to rush the guy\nThey're all cowards as soon as he confronted he gave up and ran away mhm but if if your encounter a a situation like this if you immediately turned the tables they're only going to be pointing that got in one direction if you go for them right and the odds are you're going to stop the shooting\nAnd not be shot yourself running you bring up a good point you do the populace is trained at least from what I consider him most of the downstream media\nTo be the victim which of course we rarely guns on this show I don't need to remind you or the listeners with the whole thing I mean we really believe that I mean that's much those words folks\nWhat do we do to make sure that we believe that we teach classes I mean not only myself but so many others in personal protection men and women should be treated fairly an equally in this environment whether you're a fan of C. C.

comments which are so important on this radio show\nLet's say you it's very very confusing to me\nWell many times when there's an incident whoever gets to the phone first to make the initial report gets to be the victim\nWhoever would call looking for a restraining order if there's mutual combat between\nYou know I was running a spouse and could well be that the wife is the aggressor I'm not saying that you know happens but then she automatically you get to restraining order that guy's got to give up his guns he then asked to fight it is right back\nMhm and it a lot of cases yes it does need to happen but uh\nHow are we ... it needs to be\nThought out before they just blindly sinus at and ah\nAnd you're right and it got empty some pages of verbal only continue reading and I quote this bill contains a lock up your safety provision if they were firearms in your home in the in the individual that is subject to the restraining order resides with you you must in capital letters\nAttest to the court that the individual not have any access to the firearms such as quote locked up in a safe end of quote so it is a walk up your safety bill wow I think about that folks

through inexpensive and extensive application process seeking to be ATF the for approval this typically must be done through an attorney adding to their cause\nHow is this legislation to protect the individual's medical privacy under HIPAA laws to so wow\nFolks I'm only doing what a very short little broad stroke or the brush on here it needs to be read it needs to be discussed and individuals need to at least be aware that has to be Fifteen Nineteen in its original writing revisions that we see here or the original iteration\nMay be damaging and dangerous to watch the people of Arizona but a lawful gun owners\n\nYeah and there is some good stuff in there like you said you just touched on one ... areas are bringing back money for school resource officers that you know like a main uh funding thing and there\nAre there's question what is now the GPS where they'd be federal resource officers are they going to come from local pd somebody has to sort all that out and hopefully they do before they just blindly a\nPass that like they did that on this um this bill which was horrible\nAbsolutely and further you're reading here senator Steve Smith a Republican America said legislation outlining the governor's plans Senate bill as B. fifty Nineteen respect Second Amendment rights well taking steps to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals\nAnd it goes on to say and I quote Arizona is listed by many as the number one Second Amendment stayed in the country\nI Want to keep it that way since ... Smith\nWho's sponsoring the bill however there are sensible things we can do that we're not doing today just to protect the people and protect our schools so I gather from what I'm reading here and we'll do a bigger analysis on this why not why not get the legislator\nSteve Smith on the line and future shows here on a colder rights and have he or his staff identify the ... you know the deep part of this bill\nBecause yeah there's probably a lot of good says the n._r._a. supports governor reduced his gun safety plan but isn't that ironic Jeff that deep within it could be something that's a very deleterious to a good legal firearm owners and the non criminals like the people we appeal to on the show\nYeah and from what I Know Steve Smith is a good man and he's also running for Congress\nTo try to get the seat back from o'halleran who is up in northern Arizona\nLet me shift gears Jeff here I'm going to talk about something here and it comes with it and we'll have two minutes to set the stage but here we go we talk about and we hear so much about teachers' pay and that they're the worst pay it individuals in the United states the red for it\nWhy not get the legislator Steve Smith on the line and future shows here on a call to write and have he or his staff identify the ... you know the deep part of this bill because yeah there's probably a lot of good says the n._r._a. supports governor duties gun safety plan but\nIsn't that ironic Jeff that deep within it could be something that's very a deleterious to a good legal firearm owners and the non criminals like the people were appeal to on the show\nYeah and from what I Know Steve Smith is a good man and he's also running for Congress to try to get the seat back from o'halleran who is up in northern Arizona\nInteresting let me shift gears Jeff here I'm going to talk about something here when it comes with it and we have two minutes to set the stage but here we go\nWe talk about and we hear so much about teachers' pay and that they're the worst paid individuals in the United states the red for ed movement while I respect teachers somehow and I got to say this folks I'm seeing the red in that whole thing not the Republican red\nBut more of almost like a Soviet style takeover or where\nYou know this mass mob violence kind of concept is hey you know we need more money the governor apparently has moved forward to make some better opportunities to give better pay to the teachers but it almost seems like hey we'll threatened to shut the whole damn thing down and I always thought that the teachers first responsibility\nShould be to the students quick comment from you will to carry this on after the break\nWell yeah you're right it's way bigger than just education it's right out of ... book about just said turmoil and disruption they weren't disease job they want Kirsten Sinema saying they're they want to use this to try to get out as many conservatives as they kept\nThe

[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome back to the skylight\nToday's show is going to be about several social issues and uh I'm going to talk about a variety of different subjects\nAnd maybe a share some opinions that I formed over the years on a whole laundry list of these subjects ranging from poverty to religion\nTo politics to social issues like feminist run to the prison system\nI'm just going to touch on a lot of things that um are a raw nerve for some people but I Believe that we need to talk about them because they have something to do with our daily lives and we we really need to bring them out and talk about them\nBecause here we are living in a world where we oftentimes shut our emotions at our feelings\nI'm going to talk about a variety of different subjects\nAnd maybe a\nShare some opinions that I formed over the years on um a whole laundry list of these are subjects ranging from poverty to religion\nTo politics to social issues like feminism\nTo the prison system I'm just going to touch on a lot of things that um are are wrong nerve for some people but I Believe that we need to talk about them because they have something to do with our daily lives\nAnd we we we really need to bring them out and talk about\nThem because here we are living in a world where we oftentimes shut our emotions at our feelings inside of ourselves thinking that we well we shouldn't to bring them out because if we do world are they going to cause conflict with some of our friends and neighbors\nAnd we don't really want to do that\nSo we get\nWe being kind of socially engineered at least in our culture to think that there are some things we just we just shouldn't talk about\nAnd I guess if there's a\nA good reason for it maybe we shouldn't\nBut personally I Believe there's a good reason that we should and my good reason\nIs that sometimes by sharing your feelings on even more difficult subjects you can help someone else to form valuable opinions whether they agree with you or whether they disagree with you you are bringing the subject matter to light\nAnd exposing it to them and maybe they hadn't really thought about it or consider lead from the viewpoint that you're going to share it anyway so it's good for them it's good for them to grow and mature into their own ideas when they hear other people talk and think\nSo I Know that some of my ideas will not be popular with many people\nBut some of them will be very popular with Saddam and that's all good to me\nSo let's just take the subject and visit them one at a time [noise] I think the first thing I wanted to talk about is a poverty poverty is a very sad condition that exists in probably every society in the world to some degree or another\nBut it really doesn't have to read just and I'm going to tell you why I think that um poverty in our culture is quite manifest whether you're\nLiving in an urban area or you're living in a suburban area or you're living out in\nThe country somewhere a poverty is around here you know or see people\nWho are mired in poverty in some way or another [noise]\nHow people come to get into poverty well that's a whole package of information that its own right but people do find their way into poverty I Know a lady a in a western state\nThat told me one time that she's a considered to be homeless by many people but she said I'm really not because I Choose to live the way I live\nI don't want a house either one of the conventional dwelling I ah I'm happy to sleep in my car and go around from place to place and it's just what I've done for years so\nDon't pay me I'm happy and this lady is uh\nPeople who are mired in poverty in some way or another [noise]\nHow people come to get into poverty well that's a whole package of information that its own right but people do find their way into poverty I Know a lady a in a western stage\nThat told me one time that she's are considered to be homeless by many people but she said I'm really not because I Choose to live the way I live\nI don't want a house either one of the conventional dwelling I ah I'm happy to sleep in my car and go around from place to place and it's just what I've done for years so don't pay me\nI'm happy and this lady is uh\nEvery right to be that way doesn't she uh she may not fit into the norm of the way civilization thinks that a person a lot of live in a society [noise] but if she wants to be that way that's okay but but I talk about poverty I'm Talking about people who are in poverty against our will\nSaying no you don't have a right everyone bunch to tap into that that kind of a benefit if there were there in the workplace\n[noise] but what about the people just fall into hard times or the people that don't have a job\nThey don't have such a thing unless we unless they apply for something like social welfare but the social welfare system then it's kind of like a negative that people on welfare or looked down upon\nUh they're not respected so there is a different social tier this too\nIt's kind of an unfair thing I think in our society\nBecause there's no reason for it to happen I think about this I really like do you do I imagine this in your own mind and we're not smart they get into some kind of a social space that you have country traditionally heard of it [noise]\nJust think of the practical value associated with the workings of this of whether I'm going to explain and see if you don't agree that this might not be so bad [noise]\nLet's say that since the government taxes all of the citizens\nThat all of the citizens that are in some way contributors to the welfare of the social society that we have [noise]\nSo even the people that are on welfare and given 'em an opportunity to spend money that has been given to them by the government [noise] they're being taxed on the expenses are many of those expenses maybe not on on all of them [noise]\nLike do you do I imagine that's in your own mind and we're not smart they get into some kind of a social space that you have country traditionally heard of it [noise]\nJust think of the practical value associated with the workings of this of what I'm going to explain and see if you don't agree that this might not be so bad [noise]\nLet's say that since the government taxes all of the citizens that all of the citizens that\nAre in some way contributors to the welfare of the social society that we have [noise]\nSo even the people that are on welfare and given 'em an opportunity to spend money that has been given to them by the government [noise] they're being taxed on the expenses are many of those expenses maybe not on on all of them\nBut that money is I'm not only taxed\nBut it's also part of the re circulation system so the people that make a that on the welfare system even they are contributing to society\nBecause they're contributing to keeping the money flowing and keeping it moving\nAnd they're also being taxed for things that they purchase a storage generally if they have money to spend than there being a paying sales taxes which are benefit or better better than the rest of society [noise]\nSo let me suggest it I'm not the first certainly the first one to suggest that's [noise] but I wanted to be a voice of echo [laughter] if you will because I Believe it's a pretty good idea we have enough money in our coffers in our\nSocial here in our governmental coffers\nTo contribute a stipend to virtually every citizen that lives in the United states and if we did that if we removed the social welfare system and essentially removed even the ah Social Security system [noise]\nWe could you do we get through this type and since then assures Social Security basically to everyone\nAnd this is how we would do it we would um take a certain amount of\nFixed\nDollars and award them to every citizen in the culture every citizen of the United states would get a stipend on a monthly basis be that a thousand dollars or Fifteen hundred dollars or whatever it is and we have the money to do that that's not even a question\nBut then we have been removed the stigma associated with social welfare and we will allow everyone to have enough money to survive without a\nWithout\nHaving to reviewed as impoverished we waited create\nThe potential for everyone to pay rent and everyone to have enough money for food and if we want to do was attached to that stipend some recognition of they're serving in society by doing something that society deemed it should be done\nThen that would be a perhaps all the better even if that person was only assigned to please keep their on the sidewalk clean or keep their old grass mode so that they were um looking good in the neighborhood well that would be a pretty good thing to do\nSo we have the money to do it we have the capacity to do it and this would allow no one in our culture to be\nHaving to review the as the impoverished we raised create\nThe potential for everyone to pay rent and everyone to have enough money for food [noise] and if we want to do a attached to that stipend some recognition of they're serving in society by doing something that society deemed it should be done then that would be a perhaps all the better\nEven if that person was only assigned to please keep their on the sidewalk clean or keep their own graft mode so that they were um looking good in the neighborhood well that would be a pretty good thing to do\nSo we have the money to do it we have the capacity to do it and this would allow no one in our culture\nTo be due to be able to say I don't have anything at all because everyone in the richest society on earth would say that they had and that's at least to get by\nAnd um oh you could put all kinds of little triggers that would that would allow these benefits to flow to people but I really believe that you should have this kind of a system in place\nBecause if we have the same place where people will be creating a a a society which were truly we honored around the world\nWe will be demonstrating to the whole world that a society could be sustainable for everyone\nAnd ready to be said taking the lead in doing that\nOr it certainly is a good example for somebody in the world to take the lead and wind out of the U.S [noise]\nBecause then we will be showing that we have a a place of a dignified space for every citizen and our land and wouldn't that be a nice thing wouldn't you welcome that kind of a global reputation\nFor being one society that is taking care of all of its people and not leaving anyone behind\nI think this um\nWe appreciate that this is something that many people benefit from even in the medical arena in many of their cultures in the world but we can be doing the same thing\nBut doing it in such a way that it would prove that we were benefiting the whole person yes every person in our culture not a bad idea at all so main conclusion\nLet me just say about this or let me say this about what I consider to be an uplifting scenario that constant tree circulation of money would serve as a benefit to the entire society\nNot to mention the fact that there would be a near elimination of beggars simply because you've eliminated the most common reason that most feel the need to become dependent on backing [noise]\nAnd then we would be benefiting our whole culture\nWe would be taking the lead and the world and a leader that could easily be followed by others that would help them to eliminate poverty in their own cultures and this is a good thing for all [noise]\nPlease think about it well let's move on to a different subject I think the next I wanted to talk about um the prison system this is something that affects everyone in our society whether you know it or not\nDo you think of your fellow Americans as the most criminal people in the world\n[noise] [laughter] well you probably don't but if you were to go by the numbers\nCommon reason that most feel the need to become dependent on backing [noise]\nAnd then we would be benefiting our whole culture\nWe will be taking the lead and the world and a leader that could easily be followed by others that would help them to eliminate poverty in their own cultures and this is a good thing for all [noise]\nPlease think about it well let's move on to a different subject I think the next I wanted to talk about um the prison system this is something that affects everyone in our society whether you know it or not\nDo you think of your fellow Americans as the most criminal people in the world\n[noise] [laughter] well you probably don't but if you were to go by the numbers you might be tempted to reach that conclusion because do you know that there's not a society not a country in the world that in prisons more people than the United states of America does\nIt really begs the question is is really necessary well in my opinion there's a large percentage of the people that are sitting in prisons that have no right to be there are no need to be there at all\n[noise] many of the things that we have done in our culture has been a trigger to automatically put people into prison when there was no consideration given to the the the needs of the person to the needs of the family or the\nA capacity for rehabilitation even further ... to be taken into consideration to allow that person to be recognized\nAs making foolish mistake or perhaps even being convicted other false pretenses [noise]\nAh there are many many reasons why people don't belong in prison but there is a large percentage of the people that are languishing in these places that do not belong there at all as soon as the crimes that they've committed are really not that serious\nThey might be associated with um [noise] areas raged they should be more socially responsible they should be trained and they should be required to learn or perhaps how to drive better or not give be given the privilege of being behind a wheel\nOr they might have been a divided succumbed to some kind of used for a weakness that name got them into serious trouble and all of a sudden they're they are just languishing away in prison [noise] uh this is\nThis is not reasonable for a society like ours\nOr any society honor it is not reasonable to take young people and put them in a prison system that lets them rot without\nA reason for it and I can't really think of many reasons for it there are very few people that really belong to be in prison most people should be reformed by the system outside of being a locked up\nAnd that just lets them rot\nA reason for it and I can't really think of many reasons for it there are very few people that really belong to be in prison most people should be reformed by the system outside of being a locked up\nFor thinking that we are better than others but that we're living in a better place and our our um standards or culture or something is better than others well\nThat just simply generally speaking isn't true but it's not going to change I don't think we could expect that to change because it's part of normal human behavior amongst the homo sapiens group\nOr we want to find ourselves in some kind of a superior more lofty position and religion certainly seems to help us to do that [noise] yeah and even though it's unwarranted I Believe they still are going to do it\nHowever let them alone let them believe what they believe if you happen to be a Roman Catholic or a um\nSome other ... brand of Christianity then you're going to probably believed some things about your own brand that are going to segregate you from other people [noise]\nWell I don't think that's necessarily bad unless of course you start but you start practicing things that\nMean that you're interrupting the piece of other people or interrupting their their ability or their right to believe what they want to believe everyone has a right to believe that but when they start interfering with the rights of others or even taking away the rights of others or this is not\nThis is not good and this is the one thing\nThat kind of determines for me personally whether something is being practiced in a positive or negative way\nAnd I will say that about religion only I'd say about religion and I say it about politics I say it about every cultural standard [noise] are you doing something within that arrangement\nThat segregate you just such a degree that you are a dying other people their rights do exist\nOr their rights to um have independent thoughts of their own and independent practices of their own that are outside of uh what do you consider your ah favorite social spaces\nWell then I Would say that's not a positive place to be every person has the right to because every person has been granted independent thinking every person has it we don't become less than an independent until we're capturing by some social group a upon our birds\nAnd I will say that about religion only I'd say about religion I say it about politics I say it about every cultural standard [noise] are you doing something within that arrangement\nThat segregate you to such a degree that you are a dying other people their rights do exist\nOr their rights to um have independent thoughts of their own and independent practices of their own that are outside of a what you consider your ah favorite social spaces well then I Would say that's not a positive place to be\nEvery person has the right to because every person has been granted independent thinking every person has it we don't become less than an independent until were captured by some social group ... upon our birds\nAnd then we're kind of are taught and ... and made um\nMajor conform to some social ideal because we've been captured by that ideal\nBut still within our heart of hearts\nWe have a secret person that we are that knows that we have the right to think what we want and we will oftentimes think something that is contrary to the social standards that are around us\nSimply because we can and I think that's one of the most beautiful things about humanity Irish I really wish that more of us would take advantage\nOf shooting ourselves into positive the independent thinkers and you know when we think positively without our own mind when we allow ourselves that freedom to think positive thoughts then that increases the likelihood that those positive thoughts will generate positive action\nAnd it can cause really what we need a global society\nWe need more people thinking positively and then acting positively in order to create a more positive global environment and we can do that but you know where we find it very difficult to do it and the reason we do is because we're so easily led astray and\nSo my bottom line when it comes to religion is a well live and let live or let people enjoy the relationship that they feel that they develop with uh the creator or with a spiritual being\nAnd uh let them get along at that space without interference I think that that's the best thing we can do because um none of us can prove really anything that we believe and in fact my next subject has to do with that very fact\nThat the the fact that none of us can really prove anything at all\nHardly hardly [laughter] here it is there are people that believe that um we came into being because we were created by God\nAnd then there are people that believe that we came into being because we were just a fluke\nOr that happened to happen somewhere in the billions of years passed and a ... a spark\nOf life was generated and then there's life evolved into a variety of different forums\nAnd they believe that with sincerity and so the people that believe that and the people that believe in the er the godly creation says a scenario [noise] they are constantly odds with each other each one suggesting that the other side is a\nWell they're missing something upstairs [noise] but I Would like to suggest that we don't worry so much about that because here's the truth\nWere created by God\nAnd then there are people that believe that we came into being because we were just a fluke\nOr that happened to happen somewhere in the billions of years passed\nAnd a ... a spark of life was generated and then this life evolved into a variety of different forums\nAnd they believe that with sincerity and so the people that believe that and the people that believe in the er the godly creation says a scenario [noise] they are constantly odds with each other each one suggesting that the other side is a\nWell they're missing something upstairs [noise] but I Would like to suggest that we don't worry so much about that because here's the truth that both sides\nWill accept neither side will deny that we came from the same common place that our origins are traceable back to one place and it is those origins that we need to honor\nIf we honor the origins the common ancestral a pool of humanity then we're not going to get into a conflict with those who think where that ... who really believe sincerely where that maybe came from\nHow that pool of humanity originated if we don't go back so far as to argue if we only go back so far as so as to agree then we might find ourselves I'm\nHelping to create a more peaceful environment with our fellow man [noise] because if one side is right and the other is wrong\nWell that'll be work that it'll be proven in enough time maybe it'll be proven that are on time but it tells that has proven until the end it's proven absolutely why did we just um [noise] let people believe what they want to believe\nYou know there are those historically who believed that the earth was flat there were those are historically believe it or not they believe that the earth was round\nAnd today there are still some people that believe that the earth is flat and some people that believe that the earth is round and there are other people that believe that well maybe neither one of those are true\nAnd that there is still much to be learned on that subject and I don't doubt that there is but anyway\nThe point being my bottom line is this\nHere's an opportunity we have to demonstrate that weekend um elevate society by being fair and equitable with all of our fellow man kind of all of our fellow humans remember that people generally speaking are going to believe what they want to believe\nThey're going to believe what they're led to believe but very few of us will ever have the real opportunity of knowing the facts about anything we our culture alive just\nLeft and right we are cultural lived by the spaces that we live in we're culture allies because other people have chosen to culture alive to us we our culture allies by all of our environment\nAnd we often times um\nCome to conclusions based upon that cultural cultural education [noise]\nBut he had thinking people have learned that when they step away from those cultural residents they sometimes come to different conclusions you might do that too by just simply taking the simple approach to saying\nSpeaking are going to believe what they want to believe\nThey're going to believe what they're led to believe but very few of us will ever have the real opportunity of knowing the facts about anything we our culture alive just left and right\nWe are cultural lived by the spaces that we live in we're

education [noise]\nBut he had thinking people have learned that when they step away from those cultural residents they sometimes come to different conclusions you might do that too by just simply taking the simple approach to saying let people believe what they want to believe\nIf they're not hurting other people doesn't really matter we may think it does but doesn't really matter well I'm not sure that it does because we can paint all kinds of scenarios for ourselves\nBut we have to let people believe what they want to believe because this is the freedom that have been granted to every single human that's been born [noise] there's such a great gift from that cultural space that we all came from the historic\nHumanity the pool of humanity has granted you all of us the right to think the right to be independent the right to be a person the right to be a singular entity if we choose to be\nAnd when we choose to allow ourselves to be um\nEmerged into other cultural ideals well there's nothing wrong with that I Would say but\nIf we do that we need to if we're going to be positive grants other people that are right to enjoy their cultural space there ideal thinking without us are causing conflict for that\nLet's move on to a different subject well I wanted\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to independent voters eleven hundred K. you have a great great great division a premier

and so we just have to be so mindful and this is where we hold our stress right until we can feel stressed impacting our got health environmental things you know the facts are got health drinking alcohol not sleeping\nI'm taking medications like antibiotics there's a lot of different uh challenges that are got when chemicals come into contact with it 'cause that's basically our where immune recognition is that's what I've heard as well\nSo you you as usually give us a multiple there okay\n[laughter] I like to remember\nThat\nI mean you you've been to Cuba why it's so important with a lot of things that you kind of when you when you kind of rattled off all those things which I agree with because I certainly some of them will impact me personally\nThe following program is an encore presentation [noise]\nWelcome back we're talking with Dr treats around you from the center for natural healing on many topics have healthy living in Eighteen well and I was asked so we talked a little bit before the break about how that health effects are needed to but how do our new affect our got health than mhm\nYeah so we slept in what is his book name he talks about how our minds create the health of every single cell ... um and you know he describes how you can\nGive you the children with cancer as a good role model you give them pictures to watch that show like packing eating it they can literally from their brain start dissolving Kansas how our minds affects the health of every mhm so\nIf one were chronically stress or running too fast is impacting our guts we didn't feel it we can feel the holding tension in our guy you know fill up our mind believes in stress similar that I'll get will always be instructed the same time\nWould you do the belly breathing right to stand our our abdomen which made it to me than they deserve to calm our minds down to together like we're always working back and forth but\nHow do our moods affect our got health ... yes\nSo rich slipped in what is his book name he talks about how our minds creates the health of every single cell ... um and you know he describes how you can\nYou hear the children with cancer as a good role models you give them pictures to watch that show like pack and eating it they can literally from their brain start dissolving Kansas how our minds affects the health of everything mhm so\nIf one were chronically stress or running too fast is impacting our guts we can feel it we can feel the holding tension or God you know it's all of our mind believes in stress solar got got will always be instructed the same time\nWould you do the belly breathing right to stand our our abdomen we're spending the money then they can serve to calm our minds down so together like we're always working back and forth\nBut we're not just a victim to thing to you know that's why I wanted to make sure that we're educate enough to know how to re labels mhm and that we're I'm mindful enough to slow down too so that our cells or health can turn over really ... effortlessly and in a healthy way\nSo just living a fast paced worry for life affects our gut healthy kids ...\nYou don't do any gardening antibiotic brain right if you're going fast your in your mind's doing other things ... something else exactly\nYeah so we have to be mindful of what we're doing Sheila crossing stress can sometimes causes you to lose our appetite and then we're not taking anything good and\nI you know I Know that when I get stressed out and that type of thing it's like I just I I don't even want to eat right or anything like you know and then other people will overeating ration true and that's how unique yeah people\nAre um neither one is great but we have to have some sort of a a reaction right and what we want to create more of our responses you know because the more reactive we are the more information that we have right\nOkay she'll be risky if I can get the street here [laughter] the last ... last like why don't we don't even know loss was sort of [noise]\nSo what goes into a good will affect your mood okay and what about the same number of brain will tell or ... was you know what what the what ... what to do right to replicate yes so and so it's kind of is a really a chicken egg type code conversations ... other than mood what other kinds of manifestations can one expects\nWhen there's something going on I'm I'm I'm assuming there's also some a lot of physical ... stations\nYeah there's and there was like ... in the last decade there were two books written on how it affects our mood and affects our um metabolism ... one is grain brain I Know yeah sector mount ... talks about how so many of the brain issues whether it's Parkinson's Alzheimer's ADD autism like how\nGrains affect the brain didn't like Dr Wilson talked about wheat belly\nAnd what the gas due to how we source that I'm fat you know do you know\nIt says where interchange have it as a huge highway that highway is is not block and there's no accidents and things are running smoothly that's how you're\nHealthy got an influence the health of your body so you know\nI guess you didn't really ask me that question but\nWe know that you have to modify grains affect us negatively in our moods and in our house so it's a double\nWhammy um you have to get you must get cranky when you eat certain foods\nTried to figure [laughter] member just to correct you guys\n[laughter] [laughter]\nUh no no but I don't I guess ... you know I guess what I'm trying to think is that you know why do some time for example and maybe you hit on this and the minute I missed the weather's sometime when I have a glass of wine I really feel it my guts and the same one other times not so much right exactly and I get I get that sense happening right now what's going on here\nYeah it could be quality of the line it could be how your day went okay what you ate last mhm um what your mood was before you know so there's there's lots of moving pieces and ...\nBut we know that you have to modify grains affect us negatively in our moods and in our house so it's a double whammy um you have to get you must get cranky when you eat certain foods\nTried to figure [laughter] middle just to correct you guys [laughter]\n[laughter]\nUh no no but I don't I guess what you know I guess what I'm trying to think is that you know why do some time for example and maybe you hit on this from the minute I miss the weather sometime when I have a glass of wine I really feel it my guts and the same one other times not so much right exactly and I get I get that sense happening right now what's going on here\nYeah it could be quality of the line it could be how your day went okay what you ate last mhm um\nWhat your mood was before you know so there's there's lots of moving pieces\nAnd some people you know and this is like with the mindfulness movement are trying to be aware of themselves enough that they know that when they're hungry to not drink wine you or something you know like to just kind of\nIdentify triggers or cause and effect and so we are different every moment and I have to do that sometimes like wow why did you get inflamed like ... ... ... and I'm right this minute\nYou know even if you let's use ... for example if you drink the same line 'cause you liken right what was that was fine yesterday you want to add one but two right usually go to all of a sudden today it's a it's a problem\nRight now and maybe you took an allergy medication or um maybe you didn't take your probiotics that day like everything's in your gut that especially also like we talked about what did you eat that day that could have inflamed you're got so that you put an inflammatory mark chemical and\n... yeah mark on the right to their picture right yes that'll whammy frame okay so we're talking about talking about ... seconds are naturally I think the conversation flows what's the connection between good health and our immune system\nRight right so because eighty percent of our music and lives in our small intestine or got is our immune system mhm okay so\nThere's a lot of people that don't poop everyday lot of people that you maybe have diarrhea\nAnd I think our number one health goals should be to optimize our elimination patterns than we know you know so I Believe and I do ... every quarter if I get sick I Do some more frequently just because I Know that my immune system um I Know when I'm not eating well I\nDon't know that after a while especially as you get older and you you have this ... this abacus up through the kind of yeah tells you lie right you'll beat yourself up right up twice\nSo then I Know what I Need to do at home like there is a really high doses probiotic is hired I take every day that if I had a bad day whether it was emotionally or eating I'll take this probiotic and I'll actually feel it kind of calming down all the receptors him I got a we didn't talk about it yet but\nI don't know if you know this serotonin is a ... um hormone that we make in our brain that makes a tabby mhm\nThat same um they ... require the receptors hurt for us to make their own and we have more Saratoga receptors in our guts than we do in our brain ... so whatever we do target is affecting our mood through Saratoga receptors\nAnd diverse for making a lot of us are toning were happy and WorldCom our our digestive tract will become too and if it's um\nIt's something inflammatory came into it let's say food poisoning ... we may be more efficient at healing that every one of us are going to get sick with food poisoning right how quickly we recover is determining based on how quick how healthier ... micro biome is\nAnd what we use to heal and that's I think a basic thing is that we all basically because we're living the modern lifestyle take a good probiotic or doing something really good for ourselves right\nSo what are the different ways our immune system expresses disease so they get when I can think of his allergies mhm seasonal allergies sneezing you'll get congestion mhm um food allergies can turn on um\nDifferent genes that\nDo whatever we do target is affecting our mood through Saratoga receptors and diverse for making a lot of us are toning were happy and WorldCom our our digestive tract will become too and if it's um\nIt's something inflammatory came into it let's say food poisoning ... we may be more efficient at healing that every one of us who gonna get sick with food poisoning right how quickly we recover is determining based on how quick how healthier ... micro biome is\nAnd what we use to heal and that's I think a basic thing is that we all basically because we're living the modern lifestyle take a good probiotic or doing something really\nGood for her so right so what are the different ways our immune system expresses disease\nSo they get when I can think of his allergies mhm seasonal allergies sneezing you'll get congestion mhm um food allergies can turn on um different genes that\nCaused a auto immune system right which is inflammatory their names for those we really those patients have to really watch their food and um and if you're young girls right now right now that they really are\nIt's just like a bittersweet thinks they're grateful to know how these who's making inflamed thing all their friends are eating them so it's it's it's like I'm sure you know they get inflamed\nAnd then they'll either food you know it's it's really an interesting educational time I think for this decade because I even think you know we put it together with the um what is it the\n... or all of our electronics that a comedian you know in our all of that in fact our whole nervous at the brain we have to keep up and that's why we have really good you know gravely I Need them to a really good supplements to help\n'em with all the transition ... and so when I say a good probiotics is number one and we'll talk about ... as well you just want to make sure you're getting a good one one that's been studied for um\nInoculation meaning that it it it here's your will and and you know otherwise you might be taking something with it not necessarily right yeah 'cause I've actually taken\nProbiotics that didn't agree with me right and I I really felt it yeah and then you actually got me on a probiotic that I Love yeah so I've been taking out one red Hitler so you have credit where credit's\nDue we knew that takes a lot of what you look for on the labels and when you look for ... all the good going to be or is it once again everybody's different in terms of how they accept the probiotic because\nI think everybody's different totally different and you know unfortunately the label claims over the counter you know there are a lot of uh I don't know what you call this but like if there's a really good products made by a company that other people are making the same labor but it's not the same practice that you can buy at Amazon so I don't know it's kind of scares me right now that there's so much\nThat but it's also a blessing because Everytime I hear that you're going to take away a vitamin C yeah so we can't buy or something like that makes me nervous that I really ...\nCompetitors out there are giving a bad name I mean it's right or Senate yeah it'll be educated and working with somebody yeah yeah so you actually brought up a really good thing that I probably shouldn't even be action mentioned that ... that somebody would take a label and put it on something that's not as effective as okay and when you really do have to be careful\nYou likely winner brand label and a generic things yeah mixed with the type of ... and her\nDown and that happens on you know some of these different websites\nNo we're going to be doing and heartbreaking but let's just you you talked about this before and the ... you know misinformation peach right so the inflammation as part of it was caused by what we put it in her stomach ultimately going into the small intestine regular the guts right and then\nThen the combat it we use either we use supplements like a probiotic things that will help because we're\nTake a label and put it on something that's not after the fact and has okay and what you really do you have to be careful\nYeah I'm just like we don't know I mean the brand label and the generic type things makes it that type of thing yeah yeah\nYeah and that happens on you know some of these different website\nI Know we're going to be getting a heartbreak here in a minute but let's just you you talked about this before in this you know misinformation ... so the inflammation is part of his caused by what we put in her stomach ultimately going into the small intestine right near the guts right and\nThen to combat that we use either we use supplements like a probiotic things that will help because\nBecause sometimes I hear people say well you can't get that that's a sausage there's ...\nThere's not necessarily the case if it is what's gone into the sausage for preservative aspect type of thing okay\nAnd a lot of fast food if process for it so fast food if you're stopping on your way home you know for dinner and and grabbing something most of that has been packaged in you know frozen enhanced chemicals in it and that kind of thing\nI guess it's but it's helpful I think you're talking about that only about ... for example by you know I don't know what a lot of things will McDonalds there's a good way of getting older but you still do like to fry share now very well Sara yes definitely [laughter] I\nKnow the things that you know I think there's the whole idea of what what do you identify as processed foods over here so much was usually important\nRight yeah it definitely is and as far as an immune and I don't mean to see just does I'm selling extent these fall under that category that's white man and his gluten is the thing that that causes it how can we improve our um immune that health why do we need to do\nYeah so okay we don't want to eat packaged foods very much\nAnd if we do and so just give you an example of that you can understand it from a lay person term like like I go along my day I feel fine and then you know I I'll get inflamed\nAnd I know I've had too much fun you know I've ... I've just kind of become to relax right you know with my own tradition\nAnd then I just have to dial it back you know maybe it's too much dairy and but it was a time when I had severe allergies not blaming it on the environment until I did identify through my food allergies the hill now I don't have allergies right sometimes I'll feel the threshold go ... I Know that I'm In an inflammatory cascade right now so\nUm that's number one is just identifying you know overload\nCould you know we ... ourselves like in ... [laughter] yeah\nYou know we wouldn't do that [laughter]\nSo you know it's\nTime to indulge would you really want to celebrate those special days and not being an everyday occurrence and I don't know about you guys but I attract a lot of patients that and I'm I'm not judging it but I'm saying a health perspective drink alcohol every single night of the week and that's dripping us and stripping us every day instead of like rejoicing and celebrating and making\nFun you know I've just kind of become to relax right you know with my own tradition\nAnd then I just have to dial it back you know maybe it's too much scary but it was a time when I had severe allergies are blaming it on the environment until I did identify too my food allergies the hill now I don't have allergies right sometimes I'll feel the threshold though ... I Know that I'm In an inflammatory cascade right now so\nUm that's number one is just identifying you know overload\nCould you know we ... ourselves like in ... [laughter] yeah you know we wouldn't do that [laughter]\nSo you know it's time to indulge would you really want to celebrate those special days and not being an everyday occurrence and I don't know about you guys but I attract a lot of patients that\nAnd I'm I'm not judging it but I'm saying a health perspective drink alcohol every single night of the week and that's dripping us and stripping us every day instead of like rejoicing and celebrating and making a nice time kind of like looking forward to it around and so that our body that says wait a minute that's too much\nOr as well as long as you're on the subject to him because there is it from your perspective is there any kind of um alcohol um consumption that it's better than any others or any worse than the others\nYeah there there is because um we want to alcohol\nFermented sugar right road and we want to get the least amount of sugar right there and there's another condition which I didn't bring up I don't even have down to the question but it's such a common thing I don't want to forget it\nAnd that's how common um candy to over growth is no right can do it as a part of our micro biome which is it has to be there when a ... more prolific than our probiotics than we actually have\nNot necessarily he's infections that could be a badge and he's of action but it's just a Mickey we're tired we're gaining weight um we just don't even know what's going on that probably used we're creating sugar\nOkay and so that is um I guess it's clean it's alcohol would be a a a non grain\nPlease say a good glass of wine [laughter]\nI like wine as an inflamed you than wine is good you know like I wanted to get a good\nI feel what it does to your system right yeah you're you're the one that can tell what House in ... you know your body\nBut I Would say in general the alcohol that is the most damage where he's here in the most inflammatory interesting has a lot of these tenant used sugar\nYeah volume yeah William right before we go on and all the rules so we don't forget before we go any further ... hooking our listeners contract you learn more about the center for naturally you don't want to forget\nThat or mineral yes they don't want to to our website I'm Dr him dot com they can call our office or if they're in state it's for you know out of state it's a date and it's the same um nine seven zero zero zero seven seven so hard for anybody can your joints on social media which my Facebook page\nYeah absolutely yeah so I Want to ask you that's what's foods are important for healthy get health and then if we I Know we're gonna have to go to a commercially just a few minutes but go ahead and get started on that can I just love talking about\nThis okay there's a lot of um advertising going on about buying pre ...

A. dot com and you can also call in here with me for the rest of the show to get entered into all the goodies that we're giving away from him\nOur number here is six or seven seven five three six nine and toll free it's one eight six six five three takes a lot and had a tad\nYou know you would also said to me the last time you were on that you want now started to do a estate planning but you know we want all the lawyers out there that are listening to understand that you're not an attorney had\nOkay so actually I've been doing it in state planning for quite a long time but he's never really talked about it but for any attorneys I don't do any document corrupted preparation whatsoever\nWhat I Do is help with the accounting end tax aspects of his estate planning\nAnd there's quite a few of them and and uh first of all when you started appropriate or you have a trust that you're settling you have to set up a and doing him and tore of all your assets so what I Do is I Do that using on an excel spreadsheet\nA you also believe it or not even when you passed away the IRS wants a final\nI couldn't believe it I don't believe that they do that and they don't even have to own money you know zero zero balance that my dad had but you have to do it\nThey want it filed and one of the reasons though is that if you don't file will find return they'll continue to pound you for tax returns 'cause they don't know that the person's seats mhm so that there actually is sort of a logical reason\nFor it but anyway so that's the second thing I can help you with and then third\nI can set you up and have all your final expenses paid a lot of people that was kind of a pain and it's an emotional time so they don't really want to do it right so what we do is we'll set you up with an an account on the quick books\nAnd then we can write checks for you where we won't be signing your checks you'll find them but we can repair all of checks and pay all your final bills so those are three areas where I can help a lot with estate planning\nAnd of course the attorneys won the dressed all the documents and goes over this what you how you want your assets to be distributed and so forth\nBut I can actually save you quite a bit of money\nI just didn't know that the counting and tax area goes what a lot of attorney firms do the do estate planning is a mark up the services and they'll just they'll usually have a probably a paralegal doing that kind of war inside the from\nI think it would be nice to have somebody married with you too you know have you there first\nExpenses paid a lot of people that's kind of a pain and it's an emotional time so they don't really want to do it right so what we do is we'll set you up with an an account on quick books\nAnd then we can write checks for you where we won't be signing your checks you'll find them but we can prepare all of checks and pay all your final bills so those are three areas where I can help a lot with estate planning\nAnd of course the attorneys won the dress all the documents and goes over this what you how you want your assets to be distributed and so forth\nBut I can actually save you quite a bit of money\nI just didn't know that the accounting and tax area\nGoes what a lot of attorney firms do the do estate planning is a mark up the services and they'll just they'll usually have a probably a paralegal doing that kind of work inside the from\nWell I think it would be nice to have somebody married with you too you know have their first and then you know obviously you take whatever you have and you can go to your uh your attorney for that\nNo no I work in conjunction with attorneys to ... to ... to do to all that kind of stuff\nI have to say I know anybody that's listening out there if you've been thread most people have and when the parents go run buses are gone\nThat's when all sorts of stuff starts happening right now is Fran ... it's the worst is when you have to come in there and people start fighting over the littlest things\nOn it's a very emotional time and it and I think having someone like you come in I Wish I had that you know um my dad was in California but um you know having somebody come in pay our bills take everything to the you can actually focus on you and what you're dealing with\nThat's right so it takes a lot of stress off the beneficiaries of an estate and not to mention that the cost savings so and also I wanted to mention there's a lot of uh no there's a lot of baby boomers listen to the show\nAnd there's a lot of people from California ... both are originally from California\nAnd one thing that if you say if you hit that a rental property that you still alone there or if you get a second home the probate fees are Rick amazingly high in California for the attorneys they charge like I was working on a case not too long ago person had a million dollar home\nWith a nine hundred thousand dollar mortgage on it but the way they calculate the fees on it out there is they had to pay twenty three thousand dollars in attorney fees just on this one piece of property\nSo now fortunately in Arizona we don't have that because the the user fees that are set by statute up there in ... in Arizona we they what they called reasonable these so it's a lot more uh ... it's a lot cheaper here to settle your state whether we have an attorney or not or whether you have will trust\nWell you can help anyone in the United states when it comes to their taxes you know Ken as you are the same with their state planning as well\nWell I can certainly do the other final return a I have worked on a state tax returns as well although with the new tax law you can have an estate no over twenty two million dollars before you even have to ... a state tax rates mhm so but yeah I can help anyone\nUh I'm I'm primarily I Know the laws in California's forest probate pretty well on here too but ... most of the time\nThe other states laws are much much less complex in California\nWill be your final words for today tad\nWell I Would say don't procrastinate a ... give me a call\n... I'll do that will take a look at your last three tax returns for free\nOr if you need any back returns it's August is a really good month to get them done if you're on extension we could start working on that too or if you haven't started with two thousand Seventeen we can just start doing that too so it's really good time just to start seeing me\nThe new tax law you can have in a state no over twenty two million dollars before you even have ... states mhm so but yeah I can help anyone uh I'm I'm primarily I Know the laws and California's forest probate pretty well on here too but the ... most of the time\nThe other state laws are much much less complex in California\nWill be your final words for today Ted\nWell I Would say don't procrastinate a ... give me a call\nI'll do that will

open here and I know what everyone call throughout the rest of the show you're getting entered into when at free business or personal tax return\nWell give me a call ... how much does it cost for that

where the left is are going to be ... next right or where\nWe want to gather to show our support for something and ah I occasionally get to these events myself not very often but when I Do it's always a rewarding experience I get I get to network with the movers and shakers\nIn this state that are actual patriots and willing to give up their time in order to you know help the cause of patriotism not just patriotism but preserving our way of life right right\nSo what so lately you been up against the the absolute irrationality of the uh the the less\nWell and but against Kavanaugh in particular right this is this is the Brits too far now if you if you don't know anything about World War two history you probably don't know what that means but it just means jumping the shark you probably know that one okay\nAnd I believe that the Democrats have done just that\nOn this one they will wake up people that are disgruntled Democrats are going to go to the polls but guess what they're going to vote for Republicans you got your independent so disgusted with both party right now they're going to be voting Republican you got your libertarians who are they in the line with the crazy left I don't think so\nSo what\nBottle I think red wave yeah exactly and I think that there's this whole circus and this\nSmear and and just the discussing this of the attacks on judge Kavanaugh have X\nIn particular right this is this is the Brits too far now if you if you don't know anything about World War two history you probably don't know what that means but it just means jumping the shark you probably know that one okay and I believe that the Democrats have done just that on this one they will wake up people that\nAre disgruntled Democrats are going to go to the polls but guess what they're going to vote for Republicans you got your independent so disgusted with both party right now they're going to be voting Republican you got your libertarians who are they in the line with the crazy left I don't think so\nSo what\nBlue bottle I think red wave\nYeah exactly and I think that there's this whole circus and this smear and and just the discussing ness of the attacks on judge Kavanaugh\nHave expose the left for who they truly are and and I think this is we have the momentum now I think that this is the United Republicans across the board I think\nRepublicans that were never Trump hers are coming are coming together and I think we just need to drive at home in November we cannot let them have power\nLeno deal with opening I was gonna say was a you know these charges first started out as you know high school roping\nAnd before you know with all the protesters and screaming you know rape and gang rape and you know all kinds of sexual assault and you know not to diminish the seriousness of the uh charge like that but what it's done I think also is in the future it's the cry Wilson from\nIf somebody has a legitimate\nCharge of an assault repair it's kind of been diminished if if that's not the right word but you know what I mean it's like no randomly be atmosphere asleep\nExcellent point rich because what they have done is damage to the good of the hash tag me too movement because they have torn down the legitimacy of the claims of the women that were really rape and sexually abused by\nMostly left lift I might add a almost to a man it it was it was left is that did this the that caused the me too movement okay that's just been a sidebar there [laughter]\nBut the point is cry wolf is the right analogy because now what they've done is they've politicized a legitimate\nBacklash against male of pressure on the female in the workplace or however you want to put that right that was a legitimate complaint especially in Hollywood\nRight but now\nThrow this politicized version of it and now they cause everyone to come into doubt every time there's an accusation such as it now there was an idiot thing that happened on Fox News today with Chris Wallace and\nHis show he's trying to compare\nHe was talking to Mitch McConnell and he was trying to say well you didn't back Roy Moore and you you back Kavanaugh\nAnd you know what McConnell should've said he says well with role to say well Roy Moore there were witnesses all over the place this one this one was a woman that came to the hearings there had no cooperation from anyone her best friend said she was full of you know what\nIn so many words so you're comparing a juror donkey urine to the real clear water thing\nSuch as it now there was an idiot thing that happened on Fox News today with Chris Wallace and his show he's trying to compare\nHe was talking to Mitch McConnell and he was trying to say well you didn't back Roy Moore and you you back Kavanaugh\nAnd you know what McConnell should've said he says well with rural you should have said when Roy Moore there were witnesses all over the place\nThis one this one was a woman that came to the hearings there had no cooperation from anyone her best friend said she was full of you know what and so\nMany words so you're comparing a juror donkey urine to the real clear water thing\nSo which one do you get a drink [laughter]\nThat's what I Would have done if I was my Carl [laughter]\nBut you know it's always great to sit there and aren't sure quarterback things he ... national television being grilled by Chris Wallace\nYou know the the the big comedy and Fox News in in disguise but it's not so disguised if you know what you're looking at but anyhow I thought that was so interesting so telling where the left is that even guys like Chris Wallace can't hide their by it he he claims to be such a reporter and\nOnly do that is so stupid I Can't even believe that the\nPolice or the police around the U.S\nWith our backs to us because we were facing the quote tolerance left because they knew that from being a kind of problem with going to come from us was going to be coming from them for the police literally have their backs to us because they know that we weren't going to start on anything\nNow that straightened out something feel or ideology about not be as them right now and Adolf Hitler\nThe midst of the left is that\nAdolf Hitler was a right winger absolute garbage right okay now here's the truth of the matter\nWas Adolf Hitler nationalist yes is nationalism\nRight wing no not that term initiative nationalism became can be left or right and it's not the determining factor of whether an ideology is left wing or right wing nationalism is on and so\nBut the other part of Nazi is socialist so not see literally means nationalist socialist\nNow socialist is certainly not a right wing proposition okay so Adolf Hitler was elected right and they have successfully in the universities the doctorate in doctrine nation mills of our country the the universities have taught our youth that night\nA right winger absolute garbage right okay now here's the truth of the matter\nWas Adolf Hitler nationalist yes is nationalism\nRight wing no not that term initiative nationalism became can be left or right and it's not the determining factor of whether an ideology is left wing or right wing nationalism is on and so\nBut the other part of Nazi is socialist so not see literally means nationalist socialist\nNow socialist is certainly not a right wing proposition okay so Adolf Hitler was elected right\nAnd they have successfully in the universities the doctorate in doctrine nation mills of our country the the universities have taught our youth\nThat not use them is a right wing or ideology which is absolutely ludicrous and it shows the ignorance anytime a left wing group called\nSome people that are ... patriots standing up for this country not seen it just shows how on an educated\nOr miss educated that they are and the other words they like to use this fascists in warfare is somehow I don't really understand that I don't think they understand what they do that shows them is if they don't match it\nThey were er at the Kevin or in front of flakes yesterday there were like no Trump no hates no ...\nNo ... no KKK now fast the U.S [laughter]\nI don't even understand what it is it's just something that they heard and if you know it sounds nice to them or something 'cause it rhymes or whatever that these are makes no\nSign these other people though that create dictatorships\nThese are the youthful idiots that we were talking about on the brake they don't really know what the hell are talking about they just know what they're supposed to say right so we don't even know why\nWe hope everybody can come together Tucson is the most liberal city one of the most liberal cities here in Arizona we have in a bad\nSinus on things back patriot movement in the November ten Tucson rally against far less violence three point out and that will be November tent location to be announced I'm a little bit closer to to the event\nBut it's going to be on a Saturday in November tendon eleven AM bring their flags brings some water bring your patriotism and come out and stand against this mob nonsense\nAnd we're going to have some great speakers if you're on a if you're online and follow a lot of these people on Facebook when we announced the some of the names that are you know we're getting from California people\nYes Arthur Schaper and All right great work you guys are you guys are heroes to me because I really literally can't get out and do some of the stuff and I'm so glad that you're willing to take your time and your effort and your money to get this stuff done now are worried about Mitch McConnell\nGotta say the guy is\nMe eighty percent of the time that I knew what his name was okay with with some of the things he said\nBut Trump has been has actually gave it gotten to him as well because he's got a newfound resolve that I've never seen from Mitch McConnell this guy has got energy\nIt's like contagious over there he has stood for Trump's nominees at all levels of the court system and he has got three twenty six circuit court judges so far which is that an unprecedented ace in the Senate history\nAnd that's only because Mitch McConnell is willing to do that work and why why is he doing it\nBecause he believes the president's picks are good that means Mitch McConnell\nEighty percent of the time that I knew what his name was okay with with some of the things he said\nBut Trump ism has actually gave it got to him as well because he's got a newfound resolved that I've never seen from Mitch McConnell this guy has got energy\nIt's like contagious over there he has stood for Trump's nominees at all levels of the court system and he has got through the ... circuit court judges so far which is that an unprecedented ace in the Senate history\nAnd that only because Mitch McConnell is willing to do that work and what why is he doing it\nBecause he believes the president's picks are good that means Mitch McConnell can't be all that bad either\nSo [laughter] what's going on is Trump is really galvanizing the Republican Party taking all the factions and are bringing them together he's bringing the even some of the never Trump birds are praising\nWhat's going on in the administration so next week I'm sure we're gonna have to be talking about this farcical Mueller probe in all the sordid details of of of illegality going on in our Justice Department that's being overlooked hopefully we grow up buying in that regard as well\nOkay now before we go norm how ... how much time I get that
