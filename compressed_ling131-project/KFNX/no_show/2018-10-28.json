happening is people my age I'm thirty four shows on Wall street [noise]\nWe don't understand it and we have a tendency to Newark things that we don't understand\nAll and then they have a tendency to overwhelm us and then it's too late so for me when Jamie dining basically said that ah [noise] she didn't like ... when he thought it was a farce and then a couple of weeks later he had to walk all that back 'cause he turns out he's got a ton of people inside Jamie Morgan and I'm working on it\nThat was like a eureka moment for me he's one of the smartest people I Know in financial services\nOr

that that technology\nNot really understood by people in my space\nBut the notion now that you'll be able to transfer value\nIn a way this anonymous\nHundred percent secure\nNow have to worry about the links between the two\nTransfer units right is a\nLiterally any pop will change in human history and it will it'll it'll totally transformed the way we trends\nForever and so people that are not

'cause atheist mentor people had some dues or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake ... let's let's take a look at the bill\nAnd so when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes the surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nNow secret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management let me talk about that would see on our built this thing called demanded a lot of people an ape you this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe Thirteen point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power from last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah\nIt is the hardest time of the day between three and have him and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies in a monopoly are doing to us they are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example\nFor or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just day regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power from last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM\nIt is the hardest time of the day between three and eight PM and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\nThere's no place to go except to them on and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it so the smart energy management the way that the analogy that people like like that I've been told\nIs remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance Monday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay ... a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist don't matter when we called made long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when the hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for a home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan it is to me and I do get wound up above this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay Yun ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on\nAnd I do get wound up above this and I get very upset about it is\n... ... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay Yun ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you anymore so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on that's going to continue to go up\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate from my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them and I explain all this to them\nSo not only are you paying between seven and half and eat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credits paying two words the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times and on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us sorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um\nIt it just it doesn't make sense for them they don't see any remaining rates everybody should just call you just find out how to read\nTheir bill and I don't know how to read their ... and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if he goes why didn't I Do the sooner I write so many people will say that on my show all the time it's site and I do a rate\nI'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again\nAnd I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half\nAnd today there is out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to click on a time and then they go home now I understand what she writes and so no judgments but at the end of the day we\nAll have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simply this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is\nIt's site and I do a rape I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again\nAnd I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half and today there is out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go home now I understand what she writes\nAnd so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and pay two fifty and that's essentially Carol\nI'm saving people\nOver half off their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS an assert these reports today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home we use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid for the power company\nCut in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money well here's what we're\nGoing to do we want to give out your phone number because everyone really should just give recall she has a free consultation she's ready to what the better Business Bureau I just found out at that out and uh her phone number direct it six to three\nEight five zero eight

D. drew Donald Trump people are going to vote for Donald Trump it pits the job even more when you see what they're trying to do to use the American people not only you look at what they're doing to people\nIn general but get what they did to this guy and that's why I wanted you to look at the different booking shot of this new guy\nOkay I don't have the booking shot I\nI were to I don't even know if they relate to my computer thank you I blew the new computer up so you buy a cheap one at last so I Will go by another cheap want as long as it lasts me Ninety Days that's fine\nBut if you look at the eyes like I said earlier look at the two different shots of the mug shots he was arrested X amount of years ago look at his eyes he probably was drinking and everything but if you look at his eyes now he had that same look\nAs all the rest of these other people like if you looked at the guy member of the guy what was that years back when the Batman movie came out and eat the guy with the orange\nCall themselves jumping [laughter] the joke baby fat but remember his eyeballs and then we see these\nOther people that they pick up a member of the shooter that kid and now look at the kids' eyes when you see I'm In a courtroom their cleaned up\nSo don't tell me I think we've already went through the brainwashing and the techniques and the nine yards months ago I don't need to read\nA but but the what they're using right now is the tactics against you the American people they are desperate you are winning on a daily basis\nThis last month with Donald Trump has been unbelievable the last thirty days with cabin up with a lot of these new bills teach signing each sending the troops down to the border they don't like\nThis\nAnd we're going to go over that but I Want to go through this bomb thing because we're ...\nThe clock boy or\nIs that a little too ... ... people bringing that went up to I Know can you imagine that son of a bitch doing that on Donald Trump's

and I told him I said you know what I absolutely agree with you I think it's wrong I think we're selling our natural resources and I specifically cited what's going on in the state of California with the damn stalling away the water rights the arrowhead bottled water\nAnd I I but I asked him I said you know what's that got to do with Trump man you're talking about this that the damn thing that's a blue state that's California and he goes out to tell me right wrong this or that and and he says he agrees with me but it is voices getting hoarse from screaming and yelling and protesting\nMccamon I'm not sure about water Chuck don't you don't take a drink and we'll talk about this some more bumpy hold what's that guy do he pulled out a bottle of arrowhead water and I have to drink while he's

uh Papadopoulos and the whole\nUh thing now\nI don't understand why he doesn't try to get to add a ball that situation and ... what I'm trying to tell you it's things that's why we're getting to the point that we're at right now\nEvery body that is involved in this\nThis isn't just okay the Democrat Party that we're fighting we are fighting evil\nAt every level at every department\nBecause when we win this election Donald Trump is going to be able to do what no other he's already done what no other president is done but he's also going to be able to you you actually might see for the first time in the history of the United states a U.S president arrested rock Obama\nFor actual trees and tradition the whole nine yards down the road okay but at this point do you see the nut cases that are in these positions how like when you think about it how does a guy like Cory Booker actually I understand\nPoint that we're at right now every body that is involved in this\nThis isn't just okay the Democrat Party that we're fighting we are fighting evil\nAt every level at every department\nBecause when we win this election Donald Trump is going to be able to do what no one there he's already done what no other president has done but he's also going to be able to you you actually might see for the first time in the history of the United states a U.S president arrested Brock Obama\nFor actual trees and tradition the whole nine yards down the road\nOkay but at this point do you see the nut cases that are in these positions how like when you think about it how does a guy like Cory Booker actually I understand I Know all about the whole thing but\nHe's in trouble right now\nHow does a person like Maxine Waters get elected seriously think about this you'd be a full tool elector\nThis one here in Arizona cinema\nHow could you elect somebody did you hear the latest one was cinema I Am the biggest left his congresswoman out there but you know that's on our weather to your left the squirrels down\nAnd and just like I didn't hit on it this week with this for our a guy like I said make a point why would you vote for a Republican that doesn't like your president that'd be like you voting for a Jeff Flake\nWhy why would you give him the look of what you did damsel why would you give for raw or the vote I'm sick ... believe me we don't need him to win the house if that's the only reason you're doing it you're letting yourself down you're voting for somebody that you would not vote for why would you even vote for that person\nJust what like I said give him the lip we at least\nAs I said and I will say it again\nCD nine was already put into effect by the Republican Party by the Democrat Party that that it's already won\nBy a blue person so I think it would be a bigger disgrace that every single Republican wins across the board except for\nMr Ferrara the left wing radical plans that was put down here from San Diego and then all the Republican women don't have such a nice guy I don't give a damn how nice he is he faked you out didn't eat\nFake Dolly you out and now I have people writing me well you know you're going to have him and he's going to have grad stand I'll take Greg Stanton and you want me to tell you why I'll take Greg Stanton over him I don't like anything about Greg Stanton but Greg Stanton tells the truth\nTake that for what it's worth ladies and gentleman you can save a liar no he's not he does all this liberal crap right to your face that's one damn thing I don't like them at all he's not getting my vote\nBut think about that do you want to vote for somebody that is a complete liar just think of the damage and the line that he's done to you before the election Ferrara\nAnd think about how he's going to lie to you if you allow him in that position so close that I'm not going to give him that he is one ugly son of a gun to I've seen better faces on an iodine bottle\nOkay seriously so\nJust wake up be smart we have and I'm here to tell you I spoke to a couple of my friends that are are they agreed with me and\nMember last week I told Donald Trump is Donald Trump would agree with me on ...\nFace that's one damn thing I don't like them at all he's not getting my vote but think about that do you want to vote for somebody that is a complete liar just think of the damage and the line that he's done to you before the election Ferrara\nAnd think about how he's going to lie to you if you allow him in that position so close that I'm not going to give him that he is one ugly son of a gun to I've seen better faces on an iodine bottle\nOkay seriously so\nJust wake up be smart ... and I'm here to tell you I spoke to a couple of my friends that are up they agreed with me ... member last week I told Donald Trump is Donald Trump would agree with me on Ferrara\nA hundred percent and I would bang my show my reputation and all my money on that I guarantee Donald Trump would be with me on that particular person\nAnd that would be and when I say that he's the only ... there's other Republicans I don't like Martha mix Sally I'm not like I don't I don't try to call her to get around that I could care less I'm voting for her and I'm telling you people devote four she's learned my respect to a little bit\nLet's give her the opportunity she's the one that people voted in but there's a big difference with Martha\nMartha at least was sitting there saying I back the president the president's because he's not sitting there saying while I was invited and I'm not going so you'd be a sucker I'm not going to be I told you this on a long time ago\nYou also have these other people out here do you use to who's the one with that funny hair cut to she's running against the other\nThe with the

a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal just wasn't fair and I think most people do that and I know she's obviously

believe professor port and then it was not about\nThat at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing or you know with the phone turned off and noticed his demeanor and you know it's just ... it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed because everything you described about North Dakota's lord that the independent spirit the rug and is\nThe frontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be and now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nNo I think again people have been well they've been exposed during the

the last always take the too far they took it too far with\nKavanaugh or we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump's critics but\nI think people have a lot of theories there um and\nI and the leftist they're never satisfied with they get one thing and that's okay we're going to go to the ... now we're going to push for universal health care and it's

who's ignored me for twenty five years even though I'm In New York today are you know most of the people who write for New York magazine aren't even from New York\nThat's the irony\nActually was born in how many people are rife in New York magazine are actually born in New York I don't know they're probably from somewhere else I Would think\nSo now New York magazine a ... you know they weren't that bears his prominent conservatives thing to bomb scares are liberal hoax\nSo that's almost neutral in in the way they did it\nThan the Newsweek says Michael Savage the conservative host at least there at least they're polite about it and reason and they called me the conservative host thank you\nOf the radio show Savage which has an audience of millions every which is all true\nBut at least they would dignified in their attacks Newsweek I got to give it to them\nNew York Mac prominent conservatives think the bomb scares her liberal oaks somewhat that sooner dignified prominent

Dr Ford that\nThat you think she was bigger than Dr Freud Dr Ford Dr Ford said this Dr Ford said that\nSince a PHD that's real which I have\nFrom a great university greater than hers by the way and my publications great out\nJust great out distance anything that Dr fraud published please referred to me is Dr Savage now since you not recognize his PHD is a high value\nAnd it also adds a certain or of respectability to me\nTo call me whatever you want to make sure you call me Dr Savage do whatever you do to be fair now since you believe so much into Dr business but the main thing is you don't even have to call me that just try to analyze what I'm saying for the sake of the nation\nDo you actually think it's unreasonable to be skeptical about these things in your heart of hearts are you not

section of children\nThey don't have an answer for that one\nBecause that's the way of life that's the normal way of life and it has been from the beginning of time and it will be until the end of time which has children children it's all about the children\nAnd ... what I Love his all those are talking about the children most don't even have any they generally have no children\nThey all look like Donna Shalala I don't understand that\nThe ones who are most interested in children have not\nWhy are they qualified even talking about children children if they never raised on what do they know about raising a child\nThey stayed up night with a child with the flu and lost sleep\nHave they ever gone to school with a child who couldn't do math or because they were so distracted and put aside their own self interests\nHave they ever gone to play is they didn't want to sit through for their children\nAnd they sat on soccer fields in the cold to cheer on their son\nNo but they're all experts on raising children isn't that interesting and those of us are actually raise children are smeared out his readers\nBy these wonderful people who have taken over our society\nAt least that's how I see it\nAnd I just don't buy this right now this little particular\nCharade I I don't doubt that tomorrow the next day they'll dig summing up out of a trailer park\nAnd then there'll be a Jack Ruby right afterwards first still get the Lee Harvey Oswald\nIn the Ku Klux Klan outfit or the or at our a outfit or whatever and there's probably not an an array outfit like I Would say camouflage jacket with a

shown on it right holding a copy of stop mass hysteria saying he's a member of the ...\nThat would be the perfect the perfect villain marched out\nAnd then they'll have a script in his hand\nAnd get

you know some money thrown in\nWith a one way trip to the Virgin Islands on a Sicilian fishing boat\nAnd then they'll say it'll declared yes I got all my ideas from talk radio\nI listen to talk radio

your father time goes by so quickly and it does\nYou know that I have it on the radio for a quarter of a century and he's very same forces\nThat an out destroying America tries to have tried to destroy me for a quarter of a century they've used every trick in the book they've taken me off stations they've tried to ... for slander me\nThey use the media matters to try to get my advertisers to

removing the most independent conservative voice in the country but I still will be heard across America\nA on some stations for an hour or two and also on on whatever they call it pod casting which will be an original podcast so you know there's a funny thing today they can only control so much for so long and and now that they've lost control of the narrative itself I think they're trying to take control of a new narrative\nIn my opinion that's what they're doing here\nThey've already distorted America's view of the population\nThere making you think that a good percentage of the population is gay or lesbian\nOr transsexual in fact the healthiest part part of society or gay lesbian or transsexual\nThat's what they want you to believe\nAnd so you'll just is not to be about to

and they were going to do um ... again like damage if they are allowed into the country but one thing I mean I'm totally a hundred percent behind what President Trump on this\nA and actually post show that ... around Seventy five percent of America's behind him as well you you do not have a country if your borders if your borders aren't um protect it you can't let I mean even in okay so this care man is going to have it's going to have\nBe it's going to have people who generally want a better life for themselves and their children but you can't break the law we have we have immigration laws\nWe have immigration procedures would allow people into his country a lot of people who become citizens in this country but you have to abide by the law you cannot let people and it's just this wouldn't have care of\nThings are going to happen they're going to be able to walk in here and willy nilly and nothing can be done about it no that's not how it's going to work\nRight well and of course we've had other caravans before this come in and even a one of the migrants um you know that they caught him on on tape saying look at the most there's mostly good people there are there there's there's a couple of criminals but [laughter]\nI mean it's like okay let's just great this on the curb it you know I'm In and of course you know when you hear homeland security and ... rice in the past saying you know I'm you know we have to be we have to be perfect\nIn monitoring our national security a hundred percent the bad guys they only have to they they only have to you know be lucky ones and here we are we're letting all these lucky opportunities coming through the gate like this threatening our national security\nUh and yet you know whether it's Jorge Ramos a who's got dual citizenship\nClaiming there's no way it's all just families they're all harmless street [laughter] you know coming to America and Sarah Carter's there a department of homeland security goes nah no no no I mean there on the ground and they're checking us out there going wait a minute we we've got trouble on the way here\nUm you know a good percentage of the people there are\nYoung men or you know and then on top of that they're carrying the flags of their home country their home countries they say they hate and they want nothing to do it but yet they're coming in as patriots or their own country I'm asking for entry into a um\nA a caring and giving and philanthropic country like America and I you know they seem like they're coming in as a threat not as a you know a welcome guest\nAnd they will be a threat\nMean I I Will be criminals there will be will be terrorists\nThat will be I mean yes there were they won't be a threat you cannot\nLaw law if you start if you start disagree disregarding the law if you're you're you're going down very slippery slope though I'm I'm a hundred percent behind President Trump on this one we have to abide by the law and we have immigration laws and those laws have to be followed\nWhat good All right let's talk about the courts usurpations democratic process break it down for audience\nUm I'd say that's my column this week and I and I point out that in this week in Nineteen Ninety four voters in Oregon approved the death would begin to the act that was an act that allowed terminally ill patients to buy lethal drugs presumably so that they could kill themselves\nNot as a you know a welcome gas they and they will be a threat\nMean there will be criminals there will be um and there'll be terrorists\nWill be um I mean yes there were there will be a threat you cannot I mean the lawyers and law if you start if you start disagree disregarding the law if you're you're you're going down a very slippery slope though I'm I'm a hundred percent behind President Trump on this one\nWe have to abide by the law we have immigration laws and those laws have to be followed\nWell good All right let's talk about the courts usurpations democratic process break it down for audience\nOkay um I think that's my column this week and I can I point out that in this week in Nineteen Ninety four the voters and or ground approved the death would begin to the act that was an act that allowed terminally ill patients to buy lethal drugs presumably so that they could kill themselves\nJustice Antonin Scalia commenting on that bill said and I quote you think there's a right to suicide\nDo it the way the people of Oregon did\nPass a law don't come to the Supreme Court school is point is that assisted suicide state allowing sisters through assisted suicide that's not in the legal issue there's no mention of suicide in the constitution it is obviously a cultural\nMoral societal issue which means that it was a political issue which means that shouldn't be decided by the people\nNot the courts right exactly that's\nWhy it's much that's part of it part two is that that law and and again the people in Oregon they ... what do you like their decision or not and I didn't\nBut it is still they went through the proper constitutional procedure to arrive at that decision but people made that decision to people with that decision only found on the people who are gone you know this is probably number two that the federal is principal in the constitution says that the national government\nIs responsible for national issues issues that affect all three hundred and twenty five million Americans such as national defense but they states\nAre responsible for practically every other issue but especially cultural moral societal issues there just inside them individually\nLet's face it the people in Oregon are very liberal so they will pass that that that would begin to the ... the people in Texas\nThe majority of them are not liberal or conservative they will never pass that act the point in being in each state that people have different approaches to societal cultural moral issues and that those differences must be respected that\nIs the whole point so yes the people should decide the issue but should be state by state each state decided that issue on their own\nYou know and if you don't like what you're doing 'em hey that's why you haul it exist and I get it all back and he moved to the border and uh once again bruises we've discussed many times in the show\nA this is the beauty of our constitutional Republicans we've got fifty laboratories here and they can experiment and doing and uh and this is what originalist a ... a ... like what a judge or Justice Scalia presented to us\nYes absolutely so that people are I mean again the founding fathers wanted the legislative branch to be first among equals why because the the members of Congress members the legislative branch most beholden to the people the ... the people on the sovereign power\nJustices are not elected they're appointed their decisions should have nothing to do with politics their decisions should be based on their interpretation of language in the constitution there is no language in the constitution dealing with suicide and this is obviously cultural issue again as I end my column overturned fell is a perfect example of this\nRight before the Supreme Court decided the gay marriage was to illegal in all fifty states\nMhm they're losing ... ...\nUh let's see if we can reconnect with Amir\nWe are presented to us\nYes absolutely so that people are I mean again the founding fathers one of the legislative branch to be first among equals why because of the members of Congress members the legislative branch most holding to the people the ... the people on the sovereign power\nJustices or not elected their pointed their decisions should have nothing to do with politics their decisions should be based on their interpretation of language in the constitution there is no language in the constitution dealing with suicide and it was obviously a cultural issue again as I in my column overturned fell is a perfect example of this\nRight before the Supreme Court decided that gay marriage was to illegal in all fifty states\n... ... ... ...\nOkay uh let's see if we can reconnect with him here\nOkay um and then you had the big wind up in the pitch and getting ready to come through your uh met again relevant to what a you know bruises articles pointing out to this is what a a you know an originalist perspective of a our law looks like and why are the Supreme Court\nOr you know it has to look at it in terms of how it affects everybody it's a national perspective not a local perspective\nAnd this is a problem or when the Supreme Court gets out of its lane that we run into this is why Robie Wayne is so problematic still is this something that needs to be the sides of the state level not on a federal level\nAnd I you know you'd think that we'd learned but a ... you know just as a as Hillary Clinton made it clear you know it's not a\nI mean and you know it was problematic for them when they feel like ah everything that they fought for his the day you know the the Democrats everything that they fought for that or it's being lost in the process so are\nYou know they feel justified in their lack of civility Bruce go ahead the um he had a big wind up with a pitcher an ogre felt versus Hodges right how do we go down even if\nIt is perfect example of this so that that's often the station and sided that individually treat them the political process about what happened was that five judges on the Supreme Court decided that gay marriage if he is to be illegal in all fifty states before oh we've\nHeld was decided twenty six states need to put through the state\nThrough the state court decisions twenty four other states decide is through the proper political process passing us eleven voted voted yes on gay marriage Thirteen voted no\nBut that still means that the court you surf the right of millions of American citizens to decide for themselves and issue as long standing and as deep seated as traditional marriage that is not how it's supposed to work\nExactly willing California we keep citing miss 'em you know there was a\nBallot measure about the definition of marriage one man one woman eight million votes in California and said hey look at this is the way we define marriage one man one woman\nAnd a one activist judge in San Francisco who happen to be homosexual says bad bad decisions any vacated eight million votes and it's almost like nobody said anything this Atlas Shrugged Bruce\n... can live right here ... thank you Bruce appreciate\nCisco who happened to be homosexual says bad bad decision and he vacated eight million votes and it's almost like nobody said anything it's like Atlas Shrugged worse [noise] I've got to leave it right there first Kaufman on Bill Maher Tina sly thank you Bruce ... my pleasure\nAnd intellectual property that same thing so you're right in order for them to change that they've got to agree it's a problem which right now they don't even agree on that\nThey don't they don't think Jordan you're smart enough to have intellectual property so you don't deserve to have it so I said they do that that's that's their thinking [laughter]\nBut they still have things I'm agreeing completely what the problem I'm just saying that\nBy putting tiresome them maybe in the long work I my husband does but so far it hasn't the results from higher tariffs on our part has been higher tariffs back on the mouse\nAnd slowing economic growth and upsetting the supply chain but it's hard for people to know where to get product prominence by going to pay the parents are they going to pass the tests on the consumers is just costs a lot of disruption in see\nI see it this way it's needed pain we need to go through and the reason that we're dealing with it so much just because it's just been kicked down the road and Donald Trump's kind of guy goes hey what's this can it's been kicked down there all pick it up let's do it and uh you know so he's gone ahead on with it and uh you know the good news is is whoever is president or\nDonald Trump or there's going to be a lot less cans to pick up where as a you know and after\nA you know before Trump bed varying presidents on both sides Republican and Democrat\nOr you know they got all these cans down the road there like a ... getting a hundred on the economy you know give me a break here now let me be clear up something else for me insurance saying the other problem is is the strength of the dollar that suddenly the strength of the dollar is a problem how does how does that\nPlay out because the dollar has been rising against other currencies because our interest rates are going up it makes our dollar more attractive people are at a higher yield here\nThan in Europe or Japan or other kinds of places as well so for our exporters are good to get more expensive women dollar goes up as it means we lose market share to others with cheaper currencies banned in the emerging markets they have a huge billions and billions in debt denominated in US dollars\nSo if you have to pay back in Dallas and your currency has fallen sharply the Turkish lira is down like fifty percent the fear from you if you have to repay loans\nOr in dollars and you were in Turkey at the very very painful on the same is true in Argentina and Brazil\nAnd Indonesia and South Africa and all kinds of places so that's another implication that higher dollar makes it harder and puts more pressure in emerging markets or to pay these things back or to far but I think some of that going to get close to default Argentina being an example of Venezuela's already basically given up\nWhen I understand why it's already ham Jordan Goodman on with us when we do need America's money answers man\nThat's of women dollar goes up it means we lose market share to others with cheaper currencies banned in the emerging markets they have a huge billions and billions in debt nominated in the u._s. dollars\nSo if

following managed by nature ... able to want God to be God indeed he himself wants to be gone and does not want God to be God\nI think the possibility of being in something like Harold trick situation is very disturbing for us smartphone toting self defining early twenty first century individuals\nSee we've been told to write our own stories and so it's strange to imagine that we might have an author it's strange thing letting God be God it's a strange thing being justified by grace alone\nGrace alone was the phrase the first Lutheran Protestant Reformers used to describe the one way relationship between God and God's creatures God gives creatures receive passively like characters in a story\nThe Bible describes God is the author of the story of the world so we can think of the world the universe and everything that happens in it as one great long story with all of us have characters and then we must think of God as the author of this story\nWhich means that God is the creator but not merely like a designer\nAnd author does more than design for example my smartphone had a designer but that person hasn't touched this machine and a long long time if ever the majority of of victory Asians lifespan has meant far removed from its design or not so with an author as long as the stories being told the author never leaves\nThe authors continuously present in with and under all the characters settings and turns of plot\nAnd author is the creator but not in the same way that a mother and father are creators of father begets and a mother gives birth to their child right away the parents begin to interact with the child is a fellow person who's like them in every way only smaller\nMom and dad smile baby smiled back they ask questions soon she answers there's give and take a two way relationship\nIn contrast the author character relationship only goes one way the author exist on an entirely different level\nFor example Harry Potter Ronald legally her money Granger they don't have access to JK Rowling they're not even real in the same way that JK Rowling Israel\nThere author mix them what they are characters can't give anything to the author that their author hasn't already given them first\nIt's a one way relationship here's how the Bible says it\nWho has known the mind of the lord or who has been his counselor or was given a gift to God that God should repay him for from him and threw him meant to him are all things to him be the glory into the age of the agents\nRomans eleven thirty four thirty six years old job set it in God's hands is the life of every living thing in the breath of all mankind if God tears down non can rebuild\nIts got shut demanding non can open\nAll in the same way that JK Rowling Israel there author mix them what they are characters can't give anything to the author that their author hasn't already given them first it's a one way relationship\nHere's how the Bible says it who has known the mind of the lord or who has been his counselor where it was given a gift to God that God should repay him for from him and threw him into him are all things to him be the glory into the age of the agents\nRomans eleven thirty four thirty six years old jokes said it in God's hands is the life\nOf every living thing in the breath of all mankind\nIf God tears down non can rebuild\nIf God shut demand in non can open\nIf God she gathered to himself its spirit and his breath all flesh would perish together and man would return to dust job twelve and thirty four\nJob's belief that God is the author of all things is the foreign at the throbbing source of his anguish we continue reading the perplexing book that bears his name we hear him go on to say God has torn me in his raft\nGod gives me up to the ungodly\nCatch me into the hands of the wicked why do the which it live and prosper why are not tons of justice ... by the almighty\nJob sixteen Twenty one and twenty four imagined being trapped in a story like that at a turning point in the story of Harold trick\nAgain he hears his author alluding to his past interpreting is president foreshadowing his future tiniest high here's the voice again\nIt was remarkable\nHow the simple modest elements of Harold life so often taken for granted would become the catalyst for an entirely new life\nBy the end of day\nHarold had enough again he hears that voice in his head heroin suddenly found himself beleaguered end exasperated outside the bakery\nShut up cursing the heavens and utility no I'm not I'm Kristin you you stupid voice or shut up and leave\nMe alone even if you want it out you couldn't escape\nYou can't stop being a character in your author's story that doesn't stop you from trying\nYou rebel against your author now that you realize the fear that he's in with under everything messing with you you try to fight him resisting the movement of the story trains crossing the boundaries of you're setting but the more you struggled the more you only hurt yourself the more you fight yeah and the more you find yourself fighting everyone around you\nSo you begin to resent your author you hate him\nOne day you try something new to protect yourself you start to tell a different tail it goes like this there is no author\nUnit versus a an accident on guided evolution and\nThe idea of an omnipotent author is a infant tile illusion from an age without smartphones\nI must make my own meaning I must create my own the happy ending\nAm the author of my story it's up to me to justify my life as a life worth living and so it goes you know that when we reject God the problem of justifying life in the face of evil and suffering doesn't go away\nOne day you try something new to protect yourself you start to tell a different tail it goes like this there is no author\nUnit versus a an accident on guided evolution and\nThe idea of an omnipotent author is a infant tile illusion from an age without smartphones\nI must make my own meaning Imus create my own the happy ending I\nAm the author of my story it's up to me to justify my life as a life worth living\nAnd so it goes you know that when we reject God the problem of justifying life in the face of evil and suffering doesn't go away it gets worse\nNow you and I have to bear the God awful burden of justifying ourselves justifying our actions justifying our world or else we passed the buck onto a government and that will become our author and master\nQuestion of justification is unavoidable cannot find meaning in life unless you receive it as a story and there's no story without an author and so the problem is always the same which author do we trust\nNow Harold is standing at the bus stop and once more that voice provoke him\nAnd so on this particular Wednesday evening as Harold waited for the bus his watch suddenly stopped the Herald watched rushed in into the mythical path of fate little did he know that this simple seemingly innocuous act would result in imminent\nYes watch watch\nHey hello why why am I guess hello excuse me in ... and\nHarold burst into his apartment ransacked the closet roads open doors turns out George searching for the voice okay\nWhere are you are I heard you come on you're stupid voice something desperate now Harold become his own narrator Harold frantically grabbed his lap Harold incense shook it about the room for no apparent reason smash it on the ground stopping it repeatedly\nCome on say something say something say something\n[noise] Harold distraught God Harold is stronger\nThe author speaks not about you this time but to you\nYour author addresses you personally now I'm going to ask you to stop imagining and just believe part about God being your author it's true\nThere was another part of the story that I

was an accomplished marksmen he was a very good fighter I mean he gave that police all they could handle and more you bet and I wonder how many people\nCall up he was on a social media\nAnd many people knew of his hatred\nWhy didn't we don't know all the details yet of course\nBut why was on the FBI and the police and notified that this was a dangerous person ready to explode at any minute

discussion before Jeff responds and once you have to jumping on this in a moment I just want to add this but to the radio show this morning\nYou know this is incredible I have just had an absolute this entire social media nonsense I mean how many people out there have thousands and thousands of quote friends\nThis was the thing I think let's go back twenty Thirty years wouldn't that be amazing if we didn't have this insanity when we talk with people instead of taxing people and then even worse in my opinion look at the garbage that's up there Harry I mean I post things on my own social media and I said this just in\nRight here it's just a news article idle comment on it and before the day is out there is a hundred people that are attacking me I never said I liked the article or disagreed with it however you bring up some good points to adjust your important to this equation talk about this with Harry for all\nDid we lose ...\nCrime no crime has been committed you\nCan't just get a search warrant start randomly searching people's house because they suspect something but you do need to monitor and other ways for instance the guy that at the bombs started\nThere was a record of him already committing crimes and possibly being a terrorist so there you've got a reason to possibly the searching someone but\nUnfortunately if no crime as has been committed and you are protected by the first and Second Amendment\nThis is true area you're still others do you want to do you have I I Am\nI was wondering if anybody or heard of that what kind of weapon or weapons maybe had more than one\nThat he was using to cause damage and give that police such a hard time\nNow I Know about this area and I think Jeff knows this is what's been posted on one of the British websites the tabloids and sometimes their stuff goes a little off the charts but I'm not the judge and jury apparently he had and they are Fifteen\nThat hasn't been absolutely confirmed it didn't show a picture of it but you have I saw the pictures and hearing about three blocks pistols that of course are great pistols but he shows them in the box is the highlights them on his social media just maybe you know more about this jumping\nI unfortunately I haven't I haven't had a chance of a lot like that I had a busy day yesterday sure it's still early this morning but it things will usually come out although I've got a lot to talk about if if our gas comes I won't have a chance to get to them for instance sure was Vegas shooting there still\nSo many witnesses haven't been interviewed up there and that kind of closed out I Wish they would follow through on all of these things after they happen and get down to the truth but\nUnfortunately we don't get to the truth out a lot of these things\nHow are you get the last word and again I Want to ask you not not for my own gratification but your reason for watching and listening to this radio show could be many reasons but your closing comment and then an answer to that because I appreciate your time and I wanted to say\nI like many others who your program because it's run by yourself or very intelligent experience man and you have a great guess sons and I get a lot of information\nDo you usually come out although I've got a lot to talk about if if our gas comes I won't have a chance to get to them for instance sure was Vegas shooting there still\nSo many witnesses haven't been interviewed up there and that was kind of closed out I Wish they would follow through on all of these things after they happen and get down to the truth but\nUnfortunately we don't get to the truth out a lot of these things\nHow are you get the last word and again I Want to ask you not not for my own gratification but your reason for watching and listening to this radio show could be many reasons but your closing comment and then an answer to that because I appreciate your time and I wanted to say\nWell I like many others who your program because it's run by yourself or very intelligent experience man and you have a great gifts on and I get a lot of information\nFrom the officers and the other politicians to interview for a good steward generally very good job and you increase my knowledge and intelligence and I hope and pray that you can keep it up for many more years how do we have a great weekend I'll get off to live\nNo sir thank you for your interest in this show when it's not about a host only ladies and gentleman Jeff\nHe does an admirable job and let's go back to just for a second here now we're putting people on miniatures soap boxes so to speak but it's really true Jeff I mean look you're the mayor you won your election your town is of course a very interesting pivotal point in the east valley there's so many things that are going to grow or growing in the snowy but equally important\nLet's talk quickly about your location AJ sporting goods most she'd go in there and take it from me you know I'm a client I'm a customer for good reason not just because Jeff joins us on the air\nIt's a different kind of feeling there Jeff and I'm going to give the feeling you walk and you feel welcome\nYou don't have to take a number\nYou looked at as if you're an equal not some dumb down an American who comes in with people that only came from a military background but you haven't really nice place there it's a place for everybody younger and older so what's the use and so I hopefully having inflated your head bigger than the largest that's\nWell I guess the secret is just try to make at the store I wouldn't want to shop in everything available and ah unfortunately a lot of people are disappointed they're still selling a there's a lot on the on the market and uh\nMost shops have stopped buying because therefore I'm trying to stop buying but they're still counting so\nI'm paying less than a\nGun we've been talking about a hour Fifteen very low priced I mean there are under five hundred dollar brand new that means you can find some use deals under four hundred dollars which is it's cheaper than a a a typical hand guy so and that's the market we're in right now\nSo quick summation what's hot what's not and they generally sporting goods again so she can give them a call\nOr your open those they'll just market type of protection there is an ... for instance if you go to church you can have a glock Seventeen you could easily have a glock forty three in your pocket that's where Smith in Washington she order is Springfield ...\nHaving them with you and now that's what I've been uh been wanting to talk I mean I'm only out here once a month or so or the whole cabinet thing happen it's I've been on ... and uh I also do a Second Amendment minute daily on another program ... and [noise] my summation of the whole Kavanaugh saying\nThe worst thing that happened in that whole thing\nAnybody that ever dealt with children are terrorists what is the one thing that you don't do you don't give in to them and the worst thing that happened in that whole Kavanaugh fiasco was Jeff Flake bank quarter to giving into those paid agitator\nWhich encourages them what are they going to do now they had success mhm they're going to keep\nSeventeen you could easily have a glock forty three in your pocket and it's where Smith in Washington shareholder is Springfield ... half of them with you and now that's what I've been uh been wanting to talk I mean I'm only out here once a month or so or the whole cabinet thing happen it's I've been on\n... and uh I I also do a Second Amendment minute daily on another program ... and [noise] my summation of the whole Kavanaugh saying\nThe worst thing that happened in that whole thing with anybody that ever dealt with children are terrorists what is the one thing that you don't do you do given to them like the worst thing that happened in that whole Kavanaugh fiasco was Jeff Flake bankcard hurting giving into those paid agitator\nWhich encourages them what are they going to do now they had success mhm they're gonna keep doing it if you deal with a kidnapper they're going to kidnap again\nUp a crying child ... they're going to want to be picked up every time and so now thanks to Senator Flake\nThey're going to continue to harass continue to do violence that's why you've gotta have firearms with you or close by and that's what I got out of the whole cabinet off\nAnd training ladies and gentleman Jeff ... good component I mean he was on one side of the equation he sells these\nProducts sees your mayor of a pet you judge and he knows his stuff we\nSalute him here on this radio show and we believe he supports us of course that's a great together togetherness factor but folks years even more important reason to check them out their phone number ...\nNine eight for six one six words on I Need for eight six one six or even open today\nBut if you're obviously looking to do what the regular counter trades if you have something you'd like to look at maybe you taking a look at that through the week right I've just driven you are easy to get more people that you're counter but the truth of the matter is justice was important so what I've done here\nI've not purposely announced the main name of the other guest that we're having because let's make sure that the guest appears no sense and stirring up the pot if the person's not there but if we do indeed have this special guest\nIt's going to shed some important like not only the ... on the tragedy that just became us and and just happened yesterday in the synagogue in Pittsburgh but so many more issues are very prominent person that everybody will recognize wants to hear him but if not\nWe'll continue on with yesterday who said he got

the land of ours\nWere going to have a couple of guests later on in the program from a new pathways for youth and it's about a mentoring program that is accomplished\nIn behalf of young people and a\nMentoring is of course a very valuable part of life because it means that people have a chance to learn from those who've already been down the road\nWe're going to talk to them it's just a few minutes but before we do that I Want to talk or just a little bit\nHow wonderful you are do you really personally have any idea just how wonderful you really are well I Do because I Know where you came from\nI Know what you're made of you're not just flesh and blood you're not just trade civil elements of earth and matter or even if DNA no you're much much much more than that\n\nMay claim your ancestry back to blood lines in Asia or Africa or Europe but I knew the tracing of your origins farther back that those roots you identify with\nAlready been down the road we're going to talk to them and just a few minutes before we do that I Want to talk or just a little bit\nHow wonderful you are do you really personally have any idea just how wonderful you really are well I Do because I Know where you came from\n[noise] I Know what you're made of you're not just flesh and blood you're not just traceable elements of earth and matter or even if DNA no you're much much much more than that\nYou may claim your ancestry back to blood lines in Asia or Africa or Europe [noise] but I Know what the tracing of your origins farther back that those roots you identify with that's why I Know what you're made of\n[noise] you and me and all of them well we all came from the same place and that place is the common ancestor all pool of humanity\nOne of the\nReasons that we have so many similarities so many similar features that dissimilar organics [noise]\nThe reasons we have similar wants and needs and even similar attributes is because we all came from the same place so despite the fact that there are forces at work that are constantly trying to divide us away from each other\nThat many similarities that we have unite us as one human family\nOne of the major divisional forces that human politics in politics there are individuals are generally operating within entities\nThat wants to hold a certain command over us and they've learned that if they use division they can gain the most uh forty because when they're getting one group against the other\nThan they have the attention of a large segment of the population\nFor logistical reasons they're not going to talk to you or to me personally instead they're going to be addressing crowds of people\nAnd they know that this is going to work on their behalf because they want to motivate large quantities of people and crowds can be moved and mass [noise] have you ever heard of the term a mob mentality\nWell that term acknowledges that if you take people and put them in a cluster or heard or a group [noise] then you can move them as if they are one of\nThe crowd is going to be moved with rhetoric with prodding with emotional appeals\nBut a crowd in a crowd console to be moved with reason because anxious crowds don't think\nThey only react and they can swoon they can brood taking his they can share they can have an air of excitement or an air of rage about them but as a group they cannot think\nIt takes an individual to process information better crowd will only react\nThis is another reason why you're so wonderful because you as an individual can think and reason and act and to perform remember individuals have something that a crowd does not possess a brand\nBut a crowd in a crowd can sell to be moved with reason because anxious crowds don't think\nThey only react and they can soon they can mood they can his they can share they can have an air of excitement or an air of rage about them but as a group they cannot think\nIt takes an individual to process information better crowd it will only react\nThis is another reason why you're so wonderful because you as an individual can think and reason and act and to perform remember individuals have something that a crowd does not\nPossess a brain\nHave the capacity to use it to think and to read the\nCrowds tend to act emotionally but individuals are more prone to act with intellect\nA we serve youth up and page Twenty one because for our youth we know that they need that support in resource\nOften times or the first and their families to go on to post secondary opportunities so really it's that mentoring it's our program and that really provides that support even after high school so there is a match kind of closure that takes place or a kind of celebration if you will of that relationship\nAh once that kind of natural progression reaches where it it needs to be for the youth and so that could be after high school or it could even be up until age Twenty one\nHundred maybe there could be even a lifelong friendship wouldn't be\nAbsolutely a destiny and I are actually just talking about that on the way here and that's me and I have been matched for about two years and the nature of our relationship continues to kind of falls\nKnowing that I'm working as her mentor to really meet her where she is and help provide that support and motivation\nFor her to achieve the goals that she wants to accomplish in her life and so um you know the transparent conversation that we've had is that you know I Will always be that support in her life whether it's through a formal mentor relationship or even after our matches closed after she's Twenty one\nWe'll still have that life on friendship um and really support of each other\nBecause we're in our program does it just it was a program for how long for three years three years and do you anticipate issue every enjoy the benefits of this program [noise]\nYes I Do um being in this program is like a lot I eat a lot of support from it and just not from our little but everybody that Senate ... so I get a lot of support from the staff and then other men scenes in the program so [noise] um there's a lot of people that are friends with that came about that and you had\nThe goals that she wants to accomplish in her life and so um you know the transparent conversation that we've had that you know I Will always be that support in her life whether it's through a formal mentor relationship or even after matches closed after she's Twenty one\nWe'll still have that life on friendship um and really support of each other\nBecause we're in our program dozens of dust and yet you've been with the program for how long for three years three years yeah and do you anticipate the issue has enjoyed the benefits of this program [noise]\nYes I Do um being in this program is like a lot\nI get a lot of support from it and jak not from our low but everybody that's in it for so I get a lot of support from the staff and then other mentions in the program so [noise] um there's a lot of people that are friends with that came about that and the pathway it and they gave me the same support when I'm at school so it's not just from my low it gives me a great support system\nPeriod I really measured and ready to be a wonderful goal to someday be andme indoor yes that is one of my goals that would be ideal or a natural progression you've been successfully hopes yourself underwater\nYeah because I see how much Marlowe has made a change in my life and to think that I could do that for someone else like excites me so\nI can appreciate the Marlowe what did you do just started making a change in the news and I were the things that you started accomplish I think\nShe's being very generous because I feel like she's made\nA I don't want to be really Frank I don't know exactly what I've done right I've seen her a progress I seen her her grow lifetime richer as a young woman as a you know a ... really someone that people look up to um you know having someone Seventeen now but I'll I'll Remember when she was sixteen she\nLet me know about the choices that she'd made um being that she had been enrolled in the program for a little while she said you know what the friend group that I had when I originally came to new pathways that no longer my friend group\nSo to have a sixteen year old that knows how to achieve our goals that knows how to surround yourself with the people that support her um you know really I've I've just tried to continue to be that constant support I\nSo I think just barely jak because I don't know everything I Do besides I listen I'm I I Try to challenge or I Try to coach I Try to ask questions [noise]\nUm but I also know that my goal it's her mentor it to not over impose what I think she should be doing and our program really does teach our mentors and to to really think intentionally about you know the each specific youth\nAnd what support we can provide them to achieve their goal so it's really been meeting where here where she is\nYou know being there at that support listening asking questions I'm fortunate that I have the support of a program coordinator at new pathways that checked in with the monthly to say how are things going in the relationship what are some some of the support that you need so it's it's not just me alone I had the support of a\nStaff member um ensuring that I have the resources that I Need and and so it's it's better I think a mutually beneficial beneficial relationship I joke with her that I don't know who's mentoring to because I feel like I've gotten just as much value out of our relationship as I think that she has and I think that's the power of mentorship\nYou will of course tutors and a new members you this if it plays out this way there's probably about as good as it's going to get a stream are loaded with Greg design as he wants to become a mental work for the branches\nWhile we're always looking for mentor it's we know that their youth um that really do need that support and so there is an enrollment process if you will there it's an application that's completed there's an interview process\nSome some of the support that you need so it's it's not just me alone I had the support of a\nStaff member um ensuring that I have the resources that I Need and and so it's it's better I think a mutually beneficial but beneficial relationship I joke with her that I don't know who's mentoring to because I feel like I've gotten just as much value out of our relationship is I think that she has I think that's the power of mentorship\nYou will of course tutors and a new members you this if it plays out those widows probably around as good as it's going to get on the street Marlowe does with Greg who decides he wants to become a mental and what are the branches\nWhile we're always looking for mentor it's we know that their youth um that really do need that support\nAnd so there is an enrollment process if you will there it's an application that's completed there's an interview process that takes place and also because it's an adult being matched with the youth and without supervision there's a you know the proper background checks fingerprint clearance\nAnd you know to ensure that that's what's safe person to put in a life of the youth so after that initial kind of interview application and screening process is complete every mentor completes twelve to Fifteen hours of training\nAnd understanding the culture of poverty that are used enrolled in the program are coming from its understanding kind of what it means to be a mentor and what that commitment looks like and how to coach and challenge a youth so that they can help you know achieve their potential\nSo it through that twelve to Fifteen hours of training that the mentors develop that after the training complete they get matched with the youth like destiny\nIs the managing process related to anything that made all ready to be part of part of the history of that person looks food are you going to consider family background religious background\n... all those things all of that plays a factor and and the new pathways staff does a great job and ensuring that they have an understanding of the backgrounds of both a mentor and the to ensure that the\nThe matches really successful it's it's a very intentional process when the match meeting actually takes place it's the the youth and Rome at coordinator that's really speaking to the needs of the youth and then it's our\nAnd our volunteer coordinator that does that screening of the mentor to be able to say that since the mentors background and it's through that kind of intentional conversation that they're able to ensure that the match it set up for success\nAfter we're doing pretty good what about um the parental influence how where does that play along loose with the parents were\nIt's continuous and and really once you decide that they want to be a part of our program are um youth and parent enrollment coordinator actually goes out and have it has a conversation with the parents because ultimately if you're bringing in another adult until the life of their child they need to be involved in that process\nUm and so the parents and generally is very engaged and involved they're the ones that are are agreeing to have their youth to participate in the program and to be matched with a mentor\nAnd ultimately our our families are coming for some challenging situation they want more for their youth they want more for their children and you know they're just maybe not at a space where they're able to do that\nUm and so it's it's generally a very supportive relationship that we have with our parents because they ultimately want the best for their you\nAnd worse and we also provided a parenting programs so the same life skill development that our youth are learning and that our mentors are trained than our parents participate in in as well so it's really helping our parents to understand\nWhat those life skills are that their children are are learning that they can implement in their own lives and for the use it's really creating a common language and really a framework so they feel supported not only by their mentor but also by their parents as\n[noise] okay so are you saying that if I was a parent and I had a um a teenager I wanted to see benefit from your voice\nOur families are coming person challenging situation they want more for their youth they want more for their children and you know they're just maybe not at a space where they're able to do that\nUm and so it's it's generally a very supportive relationship that we have with our parents because they ultimately want the best for their you\nAnd worse and we also provided a parenting programs so the same lifestyle development that our youth are learning and that our mentors are trained than our parents participate in a in a twelve so it's really helping our parents to understand\nWhat those light filter that their children are are learning that they can implement on their own lives and for the youth is really creating a common language and really a framework so they feel supported not only by their mentor but also by their parents as\nWell so then are you saying that if I was a parent and I had a um a teenager or that I wanted to see benefit from your program would I than approached shoes the\nOn the subject and then would you have to make it possible for me what do you what I Would like to be the mentor I Would like to rent or own my own children better I'd like to do a better job and I knew what do you ever program just for me to parent\nWe don't have statistically if a parent is enrolled in our program it needs are used to enroll in our program so so really that's kind of our current set up that we have\nAnd to be able to provide support 'em it's really more of what our youth need you know we're an organization for youth development and so we look at our parenting program not specifically towards the parents but how do we create that level of stability and support for you\nAnd so it's really parents enrolled in our program it's their youth are already enrolled in our program so it's typically\nIn terms of that kind of referral process it's not a parent that's necessarily referring there used to us it's the school district it's local homeless shelters\nThat are identifying certain risk factors in these youth where they're showing signs of delinquency of dropping out of high school early and so it's them making that first level of identification that we see not necessarily the parents\nBut then after that identification is made then it's us communicating are programmed to the parents getting there by and if they are about and then we invite them to participate in the parenting program okay\nAnd I was supposed to do the um the the counselors out there at large of determined to this young man young woman needs a little bit of garden [noise]\nUm and then the approach from the new pathways for youth and the true now that there is a person that might be a good candidate for your ...\nChildren you Jake the information you go out and visit with the parents and supposed the parents say well I don't think I Want to do this then what do you do\nIf the parent doesn't want to participate in the program but they want to support their youth and they're allowing their youth to participate will definitely allow for that you to be enrolled we don't force her parenting program or it's mandatory for parents to participate but we do\nMake sure that the parent is committed to their youth participating in the program and signing off on can set that they would be enrolled in the program\nOkay well it sounds like a very positive thing all the way round I Would say would you would you say this to do the the three years that you've been in the program has helped you polish upsurge he may be specific skills or is there anything you can tell us specifically about the benefits that you've achieved by enrollment\nI'm sure that the parent is committed to their youth participating in the program and signing off on can set that they would be enrolled in the program\nOkay well it sounds like a very positive during all the way round I Would say would you would you say this to do the the three years you've been in the program has helped you polish upsurge he may be specific skills for Israeli thing you can tell us specifically about the benefits that you've achieved by enrollment\nA before my eyes to someone that can one recognize that to have that level of awareness and to to be that you know now that kind of mentor for the younger youth to say like I get I have an understanding of where you are but\nLet me tell you about how you can show up differently I mean that's been probably the greatest reward I've seen and probably the better and better stories of just the experience in our program\nIt was very nice of you know just on the it reminds me a little bit of when I was young I had a teacher in junior high school but it was kind of like reached out to me a little bit and really acted like a bit of a mentor\nAnd help me get a from my better dude Julie veteran and I think the my attitude was that bad but I just didn't feel like I fit in that and I held back\nIf I didn't have the chance to to me I Would probably are might still be this\nKind of quieted reserved and afraid to speak to any one reactor you and I are sitting in front of these microphones on I guess we both grew up where do you want to do now that you've been subjected or I don't mean subjected but her you've had the privilege of being able to have\nNew visions of new ... book before you do you have any long term goals that you're already plotting\nYes I'm so beforehand coming into the program I never thought what I was going to do after high school I never got that they know how to put this um\nThey'll like tool of going to graduate high school I was kind of just done in high school you're going to graduate you're on the ... go to college I was never told how to get into college had applied for scholarships that or anything like that\nAnd then becoming in this program and how to model there and not much support system I realized what I actually wanted to do in life and where my long term goals I wanted to be and what kind of career I wanted to go into a kind of college I Want to go and like for right now\nI'm kind of stuck in between create so I'm really good at business and I love business but I also love seeing so those are my two ... that want to go into so I don't know which one I'm going to yet\nThat's very nice of you have to pass away now that you can choose and they believe in run into in a third one you just never know when life yeah but having the privilege of being able to develop and like a murder pointed out just watching you be able to become the person that you are and what that person or a little bit\nThat has been a wonderful experience for your life I Know\nYeah it would cause I like I said I was really couldn't\nThat and then becoming in this program and how to model there and not much support system I realized what actually wanted to do in life and let my long term goals I wanted to be and what kind of Korea I wanted to go into a kind of college I Want to go and like for right now\nI'm kind of stuck in between create so I'm really good at business and I loved it but I Am a lemonade stand so those are my two girls that want to go into it so I don't know which one I'm going to yeah [laughter]\nWell that's very nice of you have two pathways now that you can choose and they believe in run into in a third one you just never know in life that are having the privilege of being able to develop and like a murder pointed out just watching you be able to become the person that you are and let that person out a little bit\nThat has been a wonderful experience for your life I Know\nYeah LA 'cause I like I said I was really conservative I was really quiet and now that I can expect somebody self in different ways and now that I'm like making a difference in people and makes me really happy\nThat is one of the great gift we have I think as human beings as that we've been all in given the same set of resources it doesn't matter who we are where we came from we all can trace our origins back to the original pool of humanity and from the pool all the assets that humanity hands\nAre delivered to each one of us are sometimes it's just a matter of turning on the switch in that um I like to talk about the positive side of life\nBut we also have the potential for being negative yeah and we have to go through life making determinations or sometimes about what we're going to do at that particular given circumstance\nAnd we all sometimes do negative things because we are that's part of who we are too and that's what part of our potential but when you're doing something like this program\nNow you're focusing you're throwing the light on the positive side yeah and you're being encouraged to throw that switch on all the time aren't you rather than just simply letting life\nGuy does we're helping to be involved in fighting life a little bit and when we choose to do positive things well we're going to benefit ourselves and all those around us that's just that's given to this this is a beautiful program\nTo help develop that I can see that but I wanted to ask you another question Mario about the uh relationship side of it\nI was thinking about how young people often get caught up in a a kind of peer pressure that is sometimes makes a very very low ceiling in their life\nAnd so introducing an older person as a beneficial part of their life is going to help a breakthrough that feeling a little bit isn't and\nWhy is this such an essential ingredient for helping a person to mature and not just hang out with those who are of their own age\nI I think it's a couple of things I think one it's it's about exposure you know people when you look at peer groups don't you don't use can be very one sided them can be very kind of course my dad and I think\nWhen you let someone and who has a little bit more experience a little bit more you know life perspective on it really opens up a possibility that creates opportunities that and when you say really focus within your ... you're not really seeing and\nFor these are all that new pathway it's many are coming from some really difficult backgrounds where ... you know adults you know people beyond their peak peer group have turned their back on them so often times the people that they're attracting really are only their peer group [noise]\nUm but that's part of the wonderful training in development that we have a mentor hey we know that you're going to get some resistance we know that they're going to look at you like here it's an old person trying to come into my life and I'm not quite sure about that\nThanks I think one it's it's about exposure you know people that when you look at peer groups don't you don't use can be very one sided and can be very kind of close minded and I think\nWhen you let someone and who has a little bit more experience a little bit more you know life perspective on it really opens up possibilities that creates opportunities that and when you say really focus within your peer group you're not really seeing and\nFor these are all that new pathways many are coming from some really difficult backgrounds were simply you know adults you know people beyond their peak peer group have turned their back on them so often times the people that they're trusting really are only their peer group\nUm but that's part of the wonderful training and development that we have mentored that hey we know that you're going to get some resistance we know that they're going to look at you like here it's an old person\nTrying to come into my life but I'm not quite sure about that and I've had I've been burned in the past by other adults and so I'm going to stick with my peer group and not necessarily fully engaged and\nWe develop our mentors to be unstoppable to continue to you know be there to be that constant presence to continue to just you know be a stable presidents and ultimately after I Would say to a very it's that six to eight months that's when you finally have that breakthrough in the it's recognized that\nOkay or you're going to be there for me and you know yeah your perspective that you're sharing with me is different than what I thought about and\nI can see the possibility of now that we're beyond you know kind of what I was currently things so I think it takes time um but it really it's about exposure it's about showing these youth that you know there's different opinions are different thoughts there's different ways that you can approach things that are beyond what you're saying within your current here\nBy Richard that just driving down here today I was looking out of the uh the desert and you know the desert is starting to get very green and why is it getting green because of exposure the exposure to to the rainfall\nAnd the more rain we have the green or we're going to get the human aren't we more exposure we have the better it could be if it's good positive exposure was asked to bring it may not be too good for him\nBut it's just what it needs to kind of experience you're introducing through new parents ways for youth is the kind of greening up in their lives I Know that will bring benefit for them it's easy to see that it's a good thing\nI think what you was you were just talking about is really key because\nWhen young people get caught or or not only young people any people of any age get caught up with a peer group that only has a very narrow perspective of life\nUm then they're inhibited as do the things that they can do it where they can go and how they could grow\nFind very grateful to me in my life I always had parents who introduced me to people of all ages and we didn't have any kind of prejudice or anything like that was going through life I Know this was difficult for many people because they're raised in environments that might be quite so narrow\nAnd what you're doing is opening up to opening up a new door for someone who might be in a narrow space to help them uh open up at the abroad new world out there it's almost like a little girl going through the hurricane and Kansas or the tornadoes and go into the colorful new world in the yellow brick road is\nWe call him try on that new pathways sewing or their day\nA new experience and so and that's the name was approach last year to temper that at our eyes and you all of that it was that's needed for going to be a try on for you and\nYou know are you going to going to show up to be your ... and really you know fully appreciate that experience ... and her response was yes because that's gonna bring me closer to my goals and so\nYou know I think about that kind of a a large example but even so\nThey're raised in environments that might be quite so narrow and\nWhat you're doing is opening are opening up a new door for someone who might be in a narrow space to help them uh open up at the abroad new world out there it's almost like a little girl by going through the hurricane and Kansas or the tornadoes and go into the colorful new world in the yellow brick road is\nYeah we call him try on that new pathways so whenever there's\nA new experience and so and that's the name was approach last year to to present at our eyes and you all of that it was that's needed for going to be a try on for you and\nYou know are you going to going to show up to be your ... and really you know fully appreciate that experience an opportunity and her response was yes because that's going to bring me closer to my goals and so\nYou know I think about that kind of a a large example but even so small I think one of the first time we hung out she hadn't had sushi before\nAnd so it's something just as little as that you know it's just okay let's try on let's try on a different type of cuisine you haven't had before and so it really it's small but it's also when you think of a life skill dominant piece of also additional opportunity it's where the easiest are getting exposure and supportive an adult that opening their eyes to new new\nThing I'm Gillian destiny how was the sushi\nIt was really good yeah [laughter] easy to fall in love with us and the\nFood is such a beautiful try on whenever you've learned something wonderful you do you never know what you're going to come away just totally enamored with when it comes to that I can tell you the because I've been a world traveler all of my life\nThere's nothing that has enriched me more than ... would be to different people's cultures and give me a hundred people around the world and I had friends everywhere I'm so grateful for them because\nIt helps me know that no matter what I hear in the news or anywhere else I Know that the way things really are is that people are quite beautiful and they will be there for you they will be your friends if you just give them an opportunity to be that way well\nWhat about what else Marlowe would you like to share about the program that might be on the tip of your trunk [noise]\nWow that's a great question um I think I provided a lot of perspective and you know from from the mentors side which I I fully appreciate and one of the things that's really unique about our organization and about the ... the work that we're doing it the fact that it really is\nAre selective an elective on the positive side of the ... of the coin

was like behind the glass frantic fraud Ali signals that we think we got her we don't ever we got her and now we have\n[laughter] I have me\nSomehow we lost Rick's Mike though chat I don't know if we can do anything with that oh hey back you're saying welcome Dan and Dan's on here anyway\nI'm back\nIn the end of the year so Dan rate going crazy we got volatility markets up four hundred it's down five hundred it's up it's down it's this is that the ten years fluctuating\nAround between lately three point one and three point to close much closer to three point to today which is sort of you know as a kind of a indicator of rates in general are higher that goes the higher rates tend to go where are we with all this\nYeah as a matter of fact we got a midday a rate increase yesterday um so what the volatility in the market the investors tend to pull the trigger and they'll ... rate\nAnd then if we have a good day they're very very very slowly and giving us any return so anytime Anna volatile market even if you read the business section everybody is saying lock it in because it'll grow up much quicker and it's going to come down as it comes down at all\nThere you go so when you're talking about investors you're talking about the people that are the institutions that are under writing the finance right\nBy the by the loans right like least out over forty different banks and yesterday when we had a midday praised change they stop praising and if you didn't get your locking anytime you're subject to whatever the rate is after the pace of change\nSo everything went out there has to do the banks like the Wells Fargo in the U.S think and the people that we sell to\nSure mhm so everyone out there that sort of contemplate to you know now obviously they've gone through a rate increase people are still sort of hedging waiting to see if they could get maybe an east back or even a quarter\nAnd ... you know because of the ... the volatility out there than what you're saying is the chances of it coming rates coming back to you are probably less\nAbsolutely and of course I don't have a crystal ball but I always tell my clients have this payment works for you you're better off to lock it in and just go because if you don't any wait and wait\nAnd you're going to be story if you're paying a quarter percent higher or if you have to be a discount point\nMeaning let's say if you wanted to get\nToday's rate and the rate had gone up\nA quarter an eight and you're on a two hundred and eighty thousand F ha ... a point would be an additional\nTwo thousand seven hundred and forty two dollars that maybe if your life then you wouldn't have to pay\nRight you're talking about towards towards costs to get the loan\nAbsolute on the other ... on the other side of that is Rick was kind of talking about in the open we're seeing a little more softness in general in the market\nMight be a chance to hopefully negotiate some closing costs credit with the seller maybe a little bit of a discount on price it's more of a fifty fifty market\nSo you have that on the other side\nI Do I'm seeing more and more Delhi's agreed to pay costs and more and more lifting agents preparing the salaries that you're probably going to have to pay some cost if you want to sell your property because unless you've got a real hot property aggressively price may be a different story sure\nHundred and forty two dollars that maybe the a lot when you wouldn't have to pay\nRight you're talking about towards towards cost to get along\nAt the ... on the other lately on the other side of that as Rick was kind of talking about in the open we're seeing a little more softness in general in the market\nMight be a chance to hopefully negotiate from closing costs credit with the seller maybe a little bit of a discount on price it's more of a fifty fifty market\nSo you have that on the other side\nI Do I'm seeing more and more Delhi's agreed to pay costs and more and more lifting agents preparing the salaries that you're probably going to have to pay some cause if you want to sell your property because unless you've got a real hot property aggressively price may be a different story\nSure and you find that out in the first couple of weeks you'll Mr property first week\nYou'll see you'll see right off the bat what the what the activity level is you're like whoa I entered prices overprice it you know a lot of times when people get the pricing of the properties and they get five offers to thinking oh my God I under price my house not necessarily\nOur own little stable listings we we've certainly seen some reduction and it's it's generating activity so it's just a symptom of the ebb and flow of mark is what\nWould you think about the psyche of the buyer right now then would you would you say that the buyer is more apt to want to rush in in lock in by a property or would you say that\nUh they're sitting on the sidelines waiting um is it knocking a lot of people out of a of properties that they were thinking about wanting to buy and now they have to find a little bit less expensive property and they're not finding anything appealing what is your what is your take\nI'm finding that people are getting out there trying to secure a property because they're afraid rates are going to grow up because the feds they're saying they're going to raise them again so [noise]\nYes and make sure that if you are pre qualified somewhere that you check with your loan officer and find out where rates are because that can definitely a deter like if you wanted to go to Rudy\nAnd the rates going up a quarter or three three and a half and she got pre qualified you may want to bring your your thought process down to two sixty because you know what somebody can qualify doesn't necessarily mean that what they want to be on a monthly basis\nExactly and not only that but if you think about it prices are going to kind of prices in real estate are going to come down a lot slower than rates will go up so if you're looking at two eighty and now you've got to go to to sixty you're not going to be happy probably into what's up for two sixty I've been told prices started to come down\nA that's a great point and or the other thing is um what about people that are in New build situations like right now they they they got into their new build these three months ago\nAnd the property is getting its got three more months to go and uh they got qualified the very beginning on a rate that was going to be at say five percent or foreign three eighths of foreign Seventy four and a half four and a half now why\nDid you did a ... because I Would imagine some of 'em are a real close to qualifying knock qualifying uh and and you know not to mention builders cut builders contracts or non refundable\nSo if you can't qualify at the end because the rates went up you lose you earn it you lose your Ernest I'm In general yeah\nMaybe they're not all that but yeah a desert there's probably a finance contingency some things but burns money still\nActually Thursday I answer is no funniest contingency in a new bill you you you put your money up you get qualified within thirty days or Fifteen days and you're and you're on your way they're building that house based on your ear is money\nSo yeah each ... each contracted different but if you're doing a new building right now get out there find out what the rates are and see what you're a you know see what your variance it\nWell and plan for at least an additional point yeah\nWhy did that because I Would imagine some of 'em are a real close to qualifying knock qualifying uh and and you know not to mention builders cut builders contracts or non refundable so if you can't qualify at the end because the rates went up you lose you earn it you lose your artist um in general yeah maybe they're not\nAll that but yeah a desert there's probably a finance contingency some of these things but there's money still\nActually there is the answer is no finance contingency in a new bill you you you put your money up you get qualified within thirty days or Fifteen days and you're you're on your way they're building that house based on your parents' money\nSo yeah each ... each contractors different by if you're doing a new building right now get out there find out what the rates are and see what you're a you know see what your variance it\nWell and plan for at least an additional point\nWould be my advice to the buyer you know um when I qualify for me though I always qualified at least a half above ... percent above what the going rate is and I have one right now that it's supposed to close this month it's a small they'll they're it's taking them over six months\nYou know when we first started the process where in the low for and I find that convinced them to lock it four point eight seven five he kept thinking that the rates are going to come down and I said I mean they could afford it didn't matter\nBut at the large alone alone and four fifty three one their record ever present you know you're looking at eighty Ninety dollars a month for the next Thirty years they've finally locked in\nAnd he kept holding out hope that it was going to go down and now he's very grateful that he not locked them any good\nIt'd be looking at five and a quarter I mean a lot of times you're you're dealing with using builders are a lot of times I have incentives that they could be a you know\nAllocated towards you know buying down your rate which which may be an option for some of you out there if you have run into that situation where rates spiked you didn't have enough leeway in your lock what have you uh look at the bills are incentives because you may have to do you have to look at by down the rate\nUh okay yeah so we have\nAnd again if you have any questions about new bill financing or or any of the things we're talking about today the N rise hundreds direct line it's suburban

about the uh suggesting that many workers may need to significantly reduce their standard of living during retirement if they retire at age sixty seven\nFine um it's actually from a on a study the real deal to tell you find that only one out of three workers who participate in their employers benefit plans over a full career or are expected to be able to retire with reasonably adequate retirement income\nAnd study provides insight into the overall retirement readiness of us workers with access to retirement plans based on data across nearly thirty industries now the firm does cautioned that brought\nAbout six seven percent of the u._s. workforce crime or us workforce has a pension if you're one of those that do have a pension\nI'm In the end like Social Security benefits you want to become educated and what those benefits are and the climate strategy if you have a spouse you take a little bit less so that something happens to you your spouse continues the benefit or do you self insure yourself so you take a hundred percent\nAnd uh something happened to you you your spouse get nothing but they have the life insurance and maybe they get the same amount not reduced you know they can structured that way but again become educated in your benefits and all the different climbing strategies and Social Security pension\nThen what's the third source it's the main source for many many people now and going forward and that's where the focus is on this retirement planning your own money you know looking at ways to\nSo if you're one of those that do have a pension I'm again just like Social Security benefits you want to become educated and what those benefits are in the primary strategy if you have a spouse you take you know a little bit less so that something happens to you your spouse continues the benefit or do you self insure yourself so you take on a ... percent\nAnd uh something happened to you you your spouse get nothing but they have the life insurance and maybe they get the same amount not reduced you can structured that way but again become educated in your benefits and um all the different climbing strategies and Social Security pension\nThen what's the third source that's the main source for many many people now and going forward and that's where the focus is on this retirement planning your own money you know looking at ways to structure your income from what you've said\nTransitioning your retirement income I mean your retirement savings and retirement investments\nTrain changing over transitioning that to retirement income\nYou want to try to build that strong retirement plan smarter retirement plan and look at various ideas for that income and how you're going to make that money your own money work\nAnd with that\nYou have to be focusing on or be aware of the risk involved\nYou know the risk involved with taking money from your own account so a couple of things to start with so you look at it okay well what about the question what do you think the stock market or or your investments are going to do in the next ten years forget about the next year what about the next ten years there's going to be like the last ten years or is going to be something different\nIs it going to be like back in the Nineteen eighty four is going to be like two thousand and eight\nYou know you don't know but one thing or you do now is that you should be looking at the risk involved and we'll talk about market risk a little bit later is happening but the risk involved of retirement income planning\nLongevity risk is the first one\nPeople are living longer odds are people are living longer and will continue that\nAnd so you want to make sure that if that were to happen to you that you have income that will continue as long as you live and that you do not run out of income and that you do not run out of money and also for your spouse\nLongevity risk with longevity risk also come the health care issues people living longer maybe they're healthy but maybe eventually there's some health care issues\nSo you want to make sure you address or consider the possible cost of healthcare now or in the future\nLongevity risk to other risk is dealing with what they call the sequence of returns or the rate of return you get on your money before you retire and the rate of return to get on your money after you after you retire\nThere a return is you get on your money before you retire can have a major impact of when you actually retire and how much money you have\nThe right of return you get on your money in retirement I'll have a major impact on your income and your ability to keep the money and the account they have an income\nSequence of returns\nThinking about this and so you know the market up and down your account up and down if it goes down right before you retire you know maybe expand a downturn in for a couple of months or a year how's that going to affect your account balance\nYou know you go back to the example of two thousand seven somebody was going to retire in two thousand eight and all of a sudden the last thirty forty percent of their their four one K. money yeah maybe\nTo return to get on your money after you after you retire\nThere a return is you get on your money before you retire can have a major impact on when you actually retire and how much money you have\nThe right of return you get on your money in retirement I'll have a major impact on your income and your ability to keep the money and the account they have an income\nSequence of returns\nThinking about this and so you know the market up and down your account up and down if it goes down right before you retire you know maybe I could kind of downturn for a couple of months or a year how's that going to affect your account balance\nYou know you go back to the example of two thousand seven somebody was going to retire in two thousand eight and all of a sudden the last thirty forty percent of their their four one K. money yeah maybe they had to delay their retirement yeah the money came back eventually but you know where they and they continue to contribute but it took a while\nTo get the other side suppose you are we're already retired for a couple of years experience some some good turn for a while and then your investments take an income off of that everything's great\nAnd then next thing you know two thousand eight hits you lose thirty forty percent of your account value in taking money out may be the same amount and now say you're getting double hit double whammy and now maybe taking longer for your account to recover maybe it has recovered what happens is if it happens again\nSo the sequence of returns and being able to ... not knowing what your account values are going to do now you know now and then and then in the future\nAnd then the third risk is the withdrawal rate how much percent what percent how much can you take from your investment accounts what's appropriate percentage withdrawal right to to withdraw\nYou did four percent yeah you go back you know there was at five percent at seven percent you know the wall Street Journal a couple of years ago had the article in the four percent rule debt\nYou know talking about studies that have taken place dealing with a you know looking at it for protection withdrawal rate in the ability for the money to last\nYou know the Texas Tech study from the professors back in two thousand Thirteen took a million dollars to four percent out looking at various ways to invest the money all in the market all and bonds or a combination there of\nTook out at four percent wanted to go back in time when it went through a different time periods thirty five years segments\nThirty five years because eight sixty five page one hundred is thirty five years wanted to make sure there was money left it in the end of the day fifty three percent of the time they ran out of money\nYeah sometimes the money last page Ninety sometimes it only lasted in age eighty two\nSo you got to be careful here I go back and I said what's a sustainable which All right so that a hundred percent of the time the money would last one point four percent\nOne point four ... four percent of a million dollars that's fourteen thousand dollars and that kind of cut it now maybe need to look at the other

everything about him in a in twenty four Brock Obama was voted by\nOne of the conservative organizations I think African conservative review or something like that is the most left it senator in the

week have been altered\nSo our brains think something else and what it actually is that's my opinion I Can't give me the more specific than that but with us to help us sort some of the stuff out is former Secret Service\nAgents\nAre you doing Gary [noise] I'm fine how are you sir I'm well thanks for coming back on the article five hours\nMan with a with such a\nYou know short notice and but we really value your experience in you know federal law enforcement and therefore what you may have opinions on the happenings prior we particularly let's start with if you will the these plastic pipe bombs\nWhich are look pretty weird okay and look like I think I could build a better bombs in that myself\nSo I'm Wondering how a couple of things yeah whether or not you think that these things are actually intended to go off\nOne and also how did they get all over these different places in the country the same place if you know uh I don't really it doesn't really make any sense what say you were\nA tell you I have a lot of questions about it myself um [noise] all the ... with a stamps on them and know post marks um [noise] yeah you know\nI Do read cartoon size stamps I've never even bring the stamp like that maybe I don't do stuff uh like very obviously\nYeah they say they're called forever stamps so okay [noise] the other thing too is that the concerns me is like you said you know get\nTo where they ended up without being detected until the end um I have a lot of questions one of them also with\nThese things are actually intended to go off one and also how did they get all over the different places in the country in the same place if it's you know ah I don't really it doesn't really make any sense what say you well\nI'll tell you I have a lot of questions about myself I'm all the ... with a stamps on them and they'll post marks um yeah you know\nI Know to me cartoons I stand I've never even bring the stamp like that maybe I don't do stuff uh like very obviously\nThey say they're called forever stamps so okay the other thing too is that the concerns me is like you said how do they you know get\nWhere they ended up without a being detected until the end um I have a lot of questions one of them also with um [noise]\nClearly this this person didn't build any of these to explode I mean that's that's my take on it now I did read you know to be fair I did read quite a bit about it then followed the news and everything and um\nAnd that kind of made my own you know not so much assumptions but you know guns here is you know the there was one story that said that the FBI there was a couple of devices that they were so that the\nAfter inspecting them they felt they were so unstable\nThat they just actually detonated them they didn't use them for the study 'cause they were done a couple of some of the other ones that are using for the investigation so with that but you have to you have to understand what that means in in law enforcement FBI language it means is that ... that there is an explosive in it and they're not going to take the chance of it just ... on its own\nThrough shipments so they blow it up\nUm that doesn't mean it would have blown up on its own it just means they're not taking the chance so [noise] um you know they're they're like you said there's a lot of questions about about the devices hum the guy's motivation I'm\n... and the way that the right away the news media trying to spin out you know like you I'm skeptical about everything I hear from the mainstream media um even even when I watch you know Fox News I take everything with a grain of salt to you know until I kind of make my own conclusions on things\nThat let me just interrupt and let the audience know yeah do they use it missed\nGary's introduction Gary burn has what thirty seven years experience in federal loan or twenty nine yeah although they're okay or start twenty nine years experience in law enforcement federal law enforcement so we're not talking about\nSomebody that ran a story on Facebook and is now all of a sudden an expert or some of the net roots that talk about things but\nIt just so happened that it's so obvious that there's something wrong with this story that even those Internet gurus are on to something this time Gary is apparently\nYeah it is very straight and and just to let your your um listeners know my first job when I started with the secret service uniformed visited the White House was actually ... I was taught to drive the White House bomb truck so and the all the other jobs were given a way that was what I got stuck with so\n[laughter] I line we all have the this is why we liked to have you on the show because we know that you have the experience and the training to know what you are looking at when you when you're at least with the information we're given publicly anyhow\nRight absolutely absolutely\nWell you know the other thing is\nI didn't see if this ... chimes in with anybody listening or you yourself Garry I have seen this guy sees there and watch this space somewhere before that's the first thought when I saw his picture for the first time I go wow where am I seen that guy before\nYeah so his picture is showing up\nYou're a listener to know my first job when I started with the secret service uniformed visited the White House was actually ... I was taught to draw the White House bomb truck so and the all the other jobs were given a way that's what I got stuck with so\n[laughter] I line we all have the this is why we liked to have you on the show because we know that you have the experience and the training to know what you are looking at when you when you're at least with the information we're given publicly anyhow\nRight absolutely absolutely\nWell you know the other thing is\nI didn't see if this ... chimes in with anybody listening or you yourself Garry I have seen this guy sees there and watch this space somewhere before that's the first thought when I saw his picture for the first time I go wow where am I seen that guy before\nYeah so his picture is showing up on ... on social media and on you know on both sides [noise] um\nNo I yeah I Am like years ago or something or a couple of years ago or a month somewhere that's not the first time I've seen that safe when I saw\nAt the at the same feeling\nWow oh yeah it's not just me then I'm Glad to hear that [laughter]\nNo no I'm sure there's going to be some goofy photo showing up of something questionable I'm with ... with him and I thought he looked familiar to me to as a matter of fact when I first saw the photo I had to take a double take I thought\nFor you know it confused me at first it look so familiar to me so um\nThat's actually what happened to me and I'm not even talked to one person about it's not even my white this yeah you are the first person I've even mentioned that yeah [laughter] so that let me think stuff\nOkay yeah so I don't know what to think now they're you know the the speculation runs the whole gamut All right and wrong here here's the thing like I said in the opening Gary\nUh when we first started learning about the deep state and all the stuff going on oh that went on with the Obama State Department the Obama Justice department and all the holdovers and all the criminality there when we first started learning about that I said oh no\nAll the stuff I've been saying about those guys that I thought might be true is true now up to the same thing going on here with this bomb thing but it's looking not too good to be honest with you well\nI Hope so too and and you know\nUh you know like you I'm a patriot to the bone ... I'm hoping you know that this is just legit and the FBI is doing or what the FBI to return to the\nTo a better reputation there would've has right now and I want them to do that you know they did know kudos you know for now as far as we know to the FBI and the secret service and the ATF they pretty much figured this out in less than three days and that's pretty damn fast\nSo um but I Want them to get this right and I want them to get it right because I Want this guy held accountable and and\nRight you know and I want I Want them to get to the bottom of why now the postage had\nProcessed by

that you know it's beyond odd gee that's not possible\nYeah there's more questions than there are answers and every time we get another piece of information we have more question so it's like a multiplier every time they give us some some in fall we have ten times the questions that they answered so not looking good in and and\nNow then\nWhat do you think about all the confluence of all these events this this manufactured uh organized assault on our border which aired on now is to act because there's another one for me right now\nTell my wife yeah which there is a lot of more cops there I spotted a cop right there so I got a little bit better you know but there should be in more than one with an event like that and it should be somebody watching the gate when people are coming in that sort of like at least take a look at the folks that are coming out of hand you know what I mean\nI caught I ...\nYeah exactly so any way data that just friday I I was thinking about that and go wow if they never happened to be a great opportunity for the evil one that they come in there and do something like that\nNo exactly and you know it's funny a couple of weeks ago I was over a friend's house and um\nYou know they they know me real well they didn't want to carry a lot and and I was actually carrying them 'cause we were there was um the weekend and we were talking about uh getting together in a little while that day and you know having a couple of beers and I said I've got to walk home for them you know they only live around the corner from where I live I'm so I'm going to walk home person dropped my pistol\nAnd I'm In my friend's wife said can I ask you something I said yeah she said do you pick up the church and I said yeah I Do and and I said what was that you know\nConcern is she goes no no I'm just curious you know because we do go to church together once in a while we see each other church and [noise] and I said listen I always felt that if\nSomebody that that's one of the biggest soft targets that that there is because the general mentality of a lot of people is is you know I might have gone but I'm not taking in the church because there's something unholy about where to me it's exactly\nYou know they they know me real well they didn't want to carry a lot and and I was actually carrying them because we were there was um the weekend and we were talking about uh getting together in a little while that day and you know having a couple of beers and I said I've got to walk home for them you know they only live around the corner from where I live and I'm so I'm going to walk home person dropped my pistol\nAnd I'm ... and ... ... my friend's wife said can I ask you something I said yeah she said do you pick up the church and I said yeah I Do and and I said was that you know\nConcern as she goes no no I'm just curious you know because we do go to church together once in a while we see each other church and then I said listen I always felt that if\nSomebody that that's one of the biggest soft targets that that there is because the general mentality of a lot of people is is you know I might have a gun but I'm not taking in the church because there's something unholy about where to me if the exact opposite\nI haven't been on on that and then he went through with it oh yeah you know it it there you know there's a saying that people like to miss quote or misconstrue out of the Bible it says ah\nYou live by the sword die by the sword well that's just that's an equation and you just depends on which side of it Iran right [laughter]\nThat's exactly right that's exactly right and I've always felt even his even when I was young\nUm I always felt like church you know there are so many people in there and most you know I'm I'm Catholic so I go to a church and and they're usually big and there's so many doors and and you know um so yeah I Do and I and my head is almost the whole time in there I'm trying to pay attention to the sermon but you know my head is on a sweater on them\nAnd I do what I've been doing my whole do adult life I I've only you know people most of my I'm familiar with\nThe I watch all the doors and you know when we walk out and I I Do an extra little blessing and a and thank God again in and go home\nYou know and I understand and and yeah those poor people in squirrel hill\nHere not just a family but the people or stand sitting right next to them and and as injured police officers and other folks that are in your ... as a horrible event and\nThey had a pretty good risk they had a pretty good response time to do the police got they're pretty good they engage them they tried to talk them down and then when he obviously they decided it was beyond that they closed the gap and that's how they those guys got injured they closed the gap with them and engage them\nOpposite Broward County sheriff's office\nAccording exactly know exactly you know\nAnd actually the opposite\nYeah yeah well you know in that particular shooting you know the the local Bert Broward County sheriff no big goofed up but the the county ... down the road from them they showed up and and did what did their job they ran right in of course when they got there\nIn a matter of ah you know policy I guess yeah I think you know another thing is why didn't break you can possibly the matter of their poor policy okay let it is it a terrible\nPolicy you know to me that policy changes years ago um after Columbine you know you can not wait for the always wait for the SWAT Team the first two or three guys that show up but in this case in Pittsburgh they were the you know very quick responding\nMillion in let's let's just shift gears back in the euro layers of driving the bomb truck ended up um so that indicates to me that you have other than the normal level you have in excess of the normal level of training when it comes to expose divides isn't that not correct\nYeah it is and it and it's caused by accident too it's not just like when I worked at the White House I was younger rookie Ninety One and they were given all the the positions you can train for in a I guess I wasn't paying attention and ended up with the bomb dropped\nBut I kinda liked it it it was cool so it was this big old dodge\nIt is it a terrible policies you know to me that policy changes years ago um after Columbine you know you cannot wait for the always wait for the SWAT Team the first two or three guys that show up but in this case in Pittsburgh they were the you know very quick responding\nBut you didn't let let's just shift gears back your lawyers of driving the bomb truck ended up um so that indicates to me that you have other than the normal level you have in excess of the normal level of training when it comes to explosive devices that not correct\nYeah it is and it and it caught by accident too it's not just like when I worked at the White House I was younger rookie Ninety One and there were given all the the positions you can train for in a I guess I wasn't paying attention and ended up at the bottom dropped but I kinda liked it it it was cool so it was this big old dodge truck\nAnd in the back they had this big trailer with the big steel ball falls the man and if there was a device around with the White House they would put it in that trailer and then I Would get in the truck would drive it over to the old a Redskins stadium on the edge of DC and park in the big lot's empty lot\nAnd then it would have the run run a hundred yards to waiting police car and then they would drive me away so I practice it twice\nAnd um it was funny because the second time I did it it was Iran towards the car they started rolling away from me [laughter] so yeah\nI didn't do that the first time as I have yeah [laughter] a lot of them\nBut you know that was the procedure they had at the time and we never had to use it for real um and you know the um the military or does you deal with at the White House with the secret service technical services division and they would have placed the device in there and and you know I Would have driven it\nAnd then um and then really where I got a lot of extensive training and I got quite a bit in the air force in the early eighties and then when I was working at the training center I'm as firearms instructor I was always jumping in the back of classes and the guy that ran the weapons library\nFor the secret service as a training centers I had a weapons library he also did a lot of stuff with the of the show I was always hanging around him well that's\nAnd we'll talk more about that can help out the election last summer that after the last ...
