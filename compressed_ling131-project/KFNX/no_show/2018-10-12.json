question is what the hysterical girls clawing at the Supreme Court door\nThe hysterical college boys chasing Ted Cruz from a restaurant\nThe anti fought dogs chasing a poor old man and calling them Whitey and taunting him on a racial level committing a crime with a cop sitting by on a motorcycle because the cop has been the bald by the communist mayor Portland, Oregon what can you actually do if you are confronted in a restaurant or on the street\nYou actually have tremendous rights to defend yourself\nAnd I'm going to have Dan Horowitz lawyer Supreme on the show to take your calls because I think this is the point where at if we're hearing Eric Holder saying that the Democrat Party as a party that kicks people well you got to know what to do if someone kicks you that simple Mike I'm WABC you have an opinion go ahead please\nHey mark how are you a long time listener first time caller I'm I'm a retired cop in New York City for over Twenty years and believe it or not yes they do have rights I'm\nThe crime is being committed against them as aggravated harassment at the lease and you have every right to protect yourself again\nOr let's say let's say a guy and his wife are sitting in a restaurant and the way to what the earrings\nCalls his friends and they come over and son harassing him at the table first of all the restaurant is liable for not having kept him out that's number one number two what if they actually start screaming at him and spinning out I'm at the table what can you do\nFor spinning is considered an assault so at that point they can do whatever they have to do to protect themselves\nOkay I always live by a fire or when I was a police officer I live by a five foot role you can do whatever you want to say whatever you want within five feet or may once you break that five foot rule all bets are off you know at that\nAll right so let's say you're out with your wife in a restaurant in New York somewhere queens wherever you are and are somehow they know you're an ex cop and they want to harass you and that comes screaming you call your names and you say good within five feet do what you want but now they get close to the table and start shouting at you and your wife and your wife gets scared what do you do\nThat sort of immediate fear of life at that point I Do what I have to do and that's and that's what everybody anybody wants to have the fear of life Mm can protect yourself and this is it sooner OR Books you can protect yourself\nAnd do what you have to do to protect life\nMy my attorney will be on shortly and I have in my hands the California criminal jury instructions he gave me the jury instructions on the right to self defense of defensive another none homicidal it's amazing how broad our rights really are to defend ourselves against these left wing thugs\nThey want to harass you and they come screaming you call you names and you say good within five feet do what you want but now they get close to the table and start shouting at you and your wife and your wife gets scared what do you do\nThat sort of immediate fear of life at that point I Do what I have to do and that's and that's what everybody anybody wants to have the fear of life ... can protect yourself and this is it sooner OR Books you can protect yourself\nAnd do what you have to do to protect life\nWell my my attorney will be on shortly and I have in my hands the California criminal jury instructions he gave me the jury instructions on the right to self defense of defensive another none homicidal it's amazing how broad our rights really are to defend ourselves against these left wing thugs\nReally amazing we have tremendous ability to defend ourselves on what the problem here is that the media has made us so crazy than most people are intimidated to defend themselves\nUnfortunately it's called Obama hypnotized for nation for eight years\nYes and look at that Eric Holder who he was always a piece of garbage he came out and said this is the new Democratic Party we kick he always was a thug here was the chief law enforcement officer America who almost had a mob burned down Ferguson, Missouri and now he's telling Americans get ready because we're going to kick you\nRight there has already telling somebody to go and commit a crime kicking somebody believe it or like Michael is aggravated harassment that has a misdemeanor he's already telling\nMe All right look I don't know what's going on and I want to stop the man this before it gets worse I Want to stop the mass hysteria and I'm sending you a copy of the book God Bless you for being a surviving all those years in New York on the streets\nBut you know something my friend none of us are immune to what's coming Hillary holder at all want violence in this country we should avoid it at all costs but if it comes to your doorstep what do you do when I returned\nJoy most Savage Nation coal no eight five five for a number of seven eight five or four hundred and seven to eight to\nLet's say pointing their finger at you and tapping pushing their finger against your clothing yeah I Wonder what could you do at that point\nYou can use enough force to stop and you cannot you can't damage and I'm In any significant way if\nThey want if the man is over sixty and they the attacker is twenty five years old you can watch enough ... tell me what enough forces\nWell he can use greater force the the older you get them the angry or the person is the more um cohorts around who\nMade a great show old white guys now have the ability to defend themselves great\nOh yeah yeah I mean yeah yes now what if you're in a car trying to ...\nLet's say pointing their finger at you and tapping pushing their finger against your clothing yeah I Wonder what could you do at that point\nYou can use enough force to stop and you cannot you can't damage and I'm In any significant way\nWhat if the man is over six the and the the attacker is twenty five years old you can tell me what enough forces\nWell he can use greater force the the older you get them the angry or the person is the more um cohorts around who\nMay oh great so old white guys now have the ability to defend themselves great\nOh yeah yeah I mean yeah yes\nNow what if you're in a car trying to retreat from them on and they chase you out of the restaurant you're getting your car they surround you and start beating on your car with sticks and they did in Oregon what can you do them\nI Believe that that's very close to a threat of deadly force because if they get you out of the car the same weapons that they use the same gang mentality that they use their going to lead to either death or serious injury I think you can use lethal force in that situation\nAnd you know it would be no if I told you the anger motorcycle people\nYou know we're angry at a car pulled the car over banging on the windows and the driver pulled out a gun and shot a bunch of them everybody would go good you got the gangbangers you know you got the motorcycle gang here we have a ... a double standard because they've closed protesters\nWell are there any cases that you've tried in in this arena I mean that I that would be a loss of our question\nI had a case where a guy was being rude to somebody's life so the man knock knock on his butt\nAnd my client was and put on trial for knocking the bully on his butt and the jury acquitted 'em and later on one of them went up to me and said you know he was technically guilty but we didn't care the guy got what he does [laughter] that's that's the only one I've done\nSo I Know are you saying that a person can defend themselves effort if they're if\nSelf thing you know you you have to be calm when you do what you have to be professional you can't be acting at your own anger you know that's it if it's got to be in the realm of what any normal person would do which is what\nIf the guy as I say is over sixty and the mob is people in their twenties and thirties ... there's no equal forced to that\nNo I think the people whose cars are seriously ... I take away the scene where the cars being pushed the guy is leaning against the trying to stop it in their swarming the car um that one and the one where the guy got out of the car in both those instances I think deadly force um was on the table\nBut we're not recommending deadly force on this radio show and I will I Will cautioned everyone listening to the following I'm a very smart woman said to me once that you want to know that person for the rest of your life in other words do you want to be right and you want to be smart you can be right and wind up in court for ten years\nOr you can be smart and ... and try to get away in any way you can I think that's what we're talking about here as well then isn't it\nWell I [noise] you know that in a fight even if you're a train martial artist you will sometimes lose so even if you are right and even if you think you can win if you can be safe and not have to hurt somebody that's better\nUm but at the same time I don't like the idea that you have to stand down and ... you know this is a whole history I mean I was reading stop mass hysteria\nAnd you're talking about the fifties and the communist attacks and the U.S against them and if you don't stand up to this type of fascism you know whether it's Maxine Waters which is the person inside it at the beginning\nThe woman said to me once that you want to know that person for the rest of your life in other words do you want to be right as you want to be smart you can be right and wind up in court for ten years or you can be smart and ... and try to get away in any way you can I think that's what we're talking about here as well then isn't it well\nI [noise] you know that in a fight even if you're a train martial artist you will sometimes lose so even if you are right and even if you think you can win if you can be safe and not have to hurt somebody that's better\nUm but at the same time I don't like the idea that you have to stand down and ... you know this is a whole history I mean I was reading stop mass hysteria\nAnd you're talking about the fifties and the communist attacks and the U.S against them and if you don't stand up to this type of fascism [noise]\nYou know whether it's Maxine Waters which is the person inside it at the beginning of the book or these groups on the streets masked mimicking terror groups or ... of the past what what's going to happen at some point people have to stand up\nAnd that's the that's the bottom line if we don't stand up we'll all fall down right\nNow just don't keep going they'll keep going until they take over every institution in the country as they almost have already done the universities are gone most police departments have been infiltrated and taken over by left wing fanatics as you know and cops who want to do the right thing are afraid to do the right thing\nFor example in Portland we saw a police officer sitting on his motorcycle doing nothing why do you think that was\nA I think he can he look angry I bet his superiors instructed him stand down unless something actually arrested and I think he was just sitting there going this really stinks\nBecause the problem with that approach is that these attackers these rioters cut it anytime lose it and attack somebody or somebody getting out of their car or in their car can lose their temper and we'll be scared and then the violence has already happened and then the officers respond it's too late\nPreemption is the key to preventing violence we know that ...\nAll day and watch the bottom line you're let's note Dan how or when you're in a restaurant\nAnd you're actually a guy who's very fair minded and politically I think just somewhat liberal by the way which is your business or no it's okay you know you don't have to disguise yourself in any way I Know where you are in some ways\nAnd I also know that I Know that you come from a family of of heroes that I Know for a fact that can I say anything about that or not\nYou can you can talk about I thought about that today how would my\nBoss so proud of his father who's in his nineties who fought his way from the beaches in Normandy to to um to um I think Berlin in World War two you also lost your uncle the new\nI yes he took himself out of a hospital bed to fight in the battle of the bulge and died\nSo damn comes from fighters Dan does night not liked to retreat when people threaten him\nI've seen them in action in the courts so Dan I'm going to ask you a ... you're in a restaurant with me now okay I'm with you and they recognize me and I have my book out stop mass hysteria and we're reading from it and some waiter sees us doing it and he checked his friends to come in harass us\nThey come to the table and start yelling screaming what do we do\nI mean I thought about that because you were talking about that earlier and I was actually thinking of a particular restaurant where we were at where we worried about something like that happening I Would pick up a knife and disguise it in my hand and up because I'm not going to get hit sitting down\nAnd I would politely ask them to leave and if we had to I Would suggest we leave although going out on the street is dangerous I Would look to other people in\nDan does night not like to retreat when people threaten him\nI've seen them in action in the courts so Dan I'm going to ask you a ... you're in a restaurant with me now okay I'm with you and they recognize me and I have my book out stop mass hysteria and we're reading from it and some weight or she's just doing it and he checked his friends to come in harass us\nThey come to the table and start yelling screaming what do we do\nI mean I I thought about that because you were talking about that earlier and I was actually thinking of a particular restaurant where we were at where we worried about something like that happening [noise] I Would pick up on life and the skies and in my hand [laughter] end up because I'm not going to get hit\nSitting down and I would politely ask for him to leave and if we had to I Would suggest we leave although going out on the street is dangerous I Would look to other people and in the restaurant to join in and protect us included\nI won't know nobody will do that they'll look the other way I Know that for a fact\nProbably but if need be that nice kind of go where it needs to go to protect me I'm not going to take any physical violence from somebody who was attacking me Mm [noise]\nWell now you know why Denis my attorney or he's going to be bringing them into a knife I teach

by the people Trump does not own that office he's merely an occupant of it\nHe has no right to bring the level of that office down to the guts are\nIn my humble opinion now of course you'll disagree

man is a right to be in the oval office\nOf president if I if\nI Wonder if what if the president invited a pornographer in there who had a big a big following that pornography pornographic websites

a lot of people who are dismayed by the fact that we now have a disruptive force of the president but frankly I I think we needed a disruptive force and your thesis is that he delivered just what we needed\nAbsolutely right I mean way we're bound for stagnation remember when people talked about\n... percent groping the new normal now we've got four percent yup it said it could never happen and we had a ... I'm Sorry to say we had a Republican Party led by you know really nice people but they just were up to the struggle of take it on the bench\nNo they weren't and so he's kind of kicked the bucket over enforced everybody to rearrange things and obviously that causes disruption I mean it didn't cause the departure soon enough for me of Paul Ryan but uh but he we we are getting rid of him eventually I mean now at the end of the year\nBut this is the kind of thing that occasionally even private organizations need you need somebody to come in and act as a disruptor\nCabs who have the right you know and the thing about that I'm Glad you mentioned Paul Ryan I couldn't agree more of a thing as\nThe Republican Party has lost touch with you know with ordinary Americans\nAnd I work on the campaign I

you know what we ate their lunch\nIn fact doesn't seem ... outlook I'm a conservative I'm a Republican I've got a dog in the\nFight here so I've got an a built in biased but when I see the Democrats trying to position themselves as the the you know the party of the working man working woman I keep wondering policies they adopt\nSeemed to be about shifting and redistributing wealth which means not just the well to be like Donald Trump and Bill Gates but also the wealth of\nFolks who are just making a an average family income of I think now the ... sixty thousand dollar range their redistributing that wealth as well and and so there there it's the antithesis of representing that individual worker who's probably worked very hard to get to that sixty or Seventy thousand dollar household income\nYeah by the way that's up from about fifty six thousand above five years back and he's right we're we're doing pretty good I mean the wages are going up\nBut you know the the thing about the the dams is that they invested in identity politics which had nothing to do with the concerns of of people looking for a job\nAnd you know and and now they're talking about socialism and a

oil worker who's who's worried about about\nYou know what regulations are doing to the economy so you know they they've gotten invested in frivolous concerns of the people who got you know made it and maybe that everybody else behind\nTalking to Frank Frank ... who's at George Mason university ... school of law and the author most recently of the Republican workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed I I think you've spoken to some of these really important because when you become an elite in other words most of the people\nSo I mean concerns that play to the elite of the country I mean it's only people are really rich you are going to worry about that stuff okay it's it's not the the coal mine are looking for a job right to know about the oil worker was worried about about\nYou know what regulations are doing to the economy so you know they they've gotten invested in frivolous concerns of the people who got you know made it and made me that everybody else behind\nI'm Talking to Frank Frank ... who's at George Mason university ... school of law and the author most recently of the Republican workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why was just what we needed\nI I think you've spoken to some of these really important because when you become an elite in other words most of the people that you have daily contact with our people who've made it they make big salaries they don't have to worry about money\nNobody's saying I Wonder if I make the house painted this month of the car payment or can we really afford\nTo take a vacation this year these are people in an entirely different class and so like you say your your concerns change when those are the people you talked to daily and then but you have to go then out and pretend that you care about that coal miner who's being who Hillary Clinton famously\nPromise to put out of work right to their face and said we're going to put you out of work and then we'll find a job for a new running a computer or something\nI I tell you something that was really I found really interesting there's this county in Kentucky Harlan County that sacred ground to the left is that's where the\nThe series justified is said and that's where there was this big old union battle back in the Nineteen thirties and you know Pete Seeger had this song which side are you on and I I I thought this was great you know I Know which side the elite is on its coal miners and Harlan County voted eighty five percent for Donald Trump\nSo you know but you know talking about the elite that look or you know I Confess\nI'm living inside the beltway I'm a lawyer you know but then I aspire to be a traitor to my class 'cause I got these relatives\nWho are working on the assembly line\nThan Detroit and I figure if I'm On the right side of them I'm On the right side\nI think you're absolutely right one of the things you wrote about the wall Street Journal recently was telephone justice what how does that figure into the whole equation\nYou well it's you know I was making a point about the corruption of the rule of law and the way it works in Russia is before a judge reaches a verdict pill form of the you know the car the Boston the communist days you'd say what should I Do right so the telephone you know using the telephone to determine what was going to be the result\nAnd I said you know in America we've got us somewhat similar problem they have to go to the law and Russia and we got too much but here we gotta we gotta search going on for the great Trump defendant\nAnd and you know mostly it's it's just kind of ordinary ... like Mike Flynn who committed the crime of the lines of the FBI when he told the truth that wouldn't have been a crime\nNo it wouldn't have been a crime in hand what's really ... I still don't understand the Flynn case 'cause I don't understand why he with his background didn't just assume whatever I talked to the right to tell the Russian ambassador is going to be recorded by\nFive different intelligence agencies in America and when the FBI and say can we talk to you about your conversation you should assume that they already have every jot until from your conversation and they may be trying to maneuver into up into a process crime\nOr were you know we're we're we're trusting people and and our sympathies lie with law enforcement as the FBI comes in talks you most people would say you know go and shoot I'll answer whatever you want to ask me and and and you know sadly where we are in the country is that is the wrong thing to do\nWe should I mean I hate to say it Frank 'cause I've had ...\nThe FBI when he told the truth that wouldn't have been a crime\nNo it wouldn't have been a crime and and what's really ... I still don't understand the Flynn case 'cause I don't understand why he with his background didn't just assume whatever I talk to the right to tell the Russian ambassador is going to be recorded by\nFive different intelligence agencies in America and when the FBI and say can we talk to you about your conversation you should assume that they already have every jot and ... from your conversation and they may be trying to maneuver into up into a process crime\nOr well you know we're we're we're trusting people and and our sympathies lie with law enforcement of the FBI comes into your most people would say you know go and shoot I'll answer whatever you want to ask me and and and you know sadly wherever we are in a country is that is the wrong thing to do\nMaybe we should I mean I hate to say and Frank 'cause I've had friends who were FBI agent Secret Service agents cops sheriff's deputies you hate to started acting like when the police show up for the FBI shows have you say\nThe person who decides whether or not a particular man or woman is the person for the job is the president or the Senate can say\nThis president you've nominated a thoroughly unqualified candidate we reject him or her but in this case they had to admit that Brett Kavanaugh was ... was a a fully qualified candidate\nSo their job was to simply affirmed that and put them on the court which is what they finally at long last it with one Democrat voting the right way and I mentioned this little off\nIt was amazing to watch this president Donald Trump\nSitting behind the resolute desk in the oval office today and Kanye West sitting across the desk from him and Donald Trump listening for I Would say the better part of about ten minutes now I'm not going to play all of it\nBut I wanted to play just a little bit of this because this is Kanye West and I know the standard line from the left is what this man is crazy now why did they think he's crazy because he he's a successful black American\nWhose conservative in a lot of his views not all of them and he supports Donald Trump to the left anybody who supports Donald Trump is crazy as far as I'm concerned they probably think I'm Crazy all I'm find to be put I'm I'm okay with being put in that category but take a listen to just a bit\nUh I I was at a fair the reason why people say you know first of all the jobs are so far as I say more has more\nCare oh hey we got to\nInstitute in age and then I\nDid they think he's crazy because he he's a successful black American\nWhose conservative in a lot of his views not all of them and he supports Donald Trump or to the left anybody who supports Donald Trump is crazy as far as I'm concerned they probably think I'm Crazy on find to be put on I'm OK with being put in that category but take a listen to just a bit of sex or for\nAre I have a conversation that basically says that welfare of the reason why a lot of people say you know first of all they have a limited amount of jobs I saw the fathers of the job and they say we'll give you more money for having more kids\nIn your home and then we got rid of the mental\nHealth Institute and AIDS and then I and the British just shy\nOf ... which is actually going down twenty now he\nHe mentioned ... Iraq a clear reference to Chicago which has an amazing number of murders and in that Democrat leadership of that city that doesn't seem to be able to get a handle on the problems that we saw the

up\nAmazon ... lobbying and they've got these beautiful beautiful opposite from DC and so it is so this school and so to stay stuck in there all breaking bread and getting everybody I mean they're not down there protecting their turf and their shareholders so [noise]\nYou know it's um it's a tough situation and we have our problems in our addictions with our Facebook and our Amazon Prime\nI guess what I worry about it but it is this and this is the other worry I have Michael did even if we say well they're too big\nI got to respond to this one is you mentioned Sears and Roebuck well ... now a little longer and they're about to go out of business it seems but back when seniors first came on the scene they had to be one of the first uh entities that enter the marketplace and said\nYou don't have to buy your dung agrees with the local general store you can just drop you know dropping out in the mail and they'll show up you know back to you and I imagine at the time it was probably viewed as pretty darned amazing does say\nUh you know I can you mean I can order pots and pans and sheets and blankets and pillows and all that stuff and it'll just magically appear and I've got a lot more choice and you know and maybe a better price and everything else so Sears was kind of revolutionary back in the day\nI understand that Amazon is on that on steroids but we were you know we're we're concerned at the time I'm sure there were probably concerns of the time that we're going to wipe out the local general store will they didn't you know we have lots of these big retailers in America now and they didn't wipe out the local general store but I'm I guarantee you they had an effect\nThe second concern I have is this um that as we're in a world marketplace now if we say Amazon we've got a break you up into pieces to make sure you don't get too big real China and other countries have the same constraints because remember when it's a worldwide service me a worldwide Internet\nIf you say Amazon can't get big but China can have a you know or you know can have companies that are that big are we going to see the day where we've knocked down our own Goliath our own Amazon and we've allowed all the other countries that don't have the same kind of restraint to do it and now Americans will be buying from them instead\nI can I can buy a small business part because although I saw what they did to\nPublishing that government part I I'm a little bit less less empathetic on because you know apple\nApple Amazon and the the rights and the constitution of belief and that human rights things that they just look the other way when they do business there is no Tories are leading me to believe that if we put our foot down and not going to go out running we're not going to give our power away\nAnd that while they want to practice and do business there they don't necessarily want to be there so um if it just and this is the topic for discussion and there's no right or wrong answer because they have done a lot of really good innovation and\nThat's good but there's also a lot of crushing going on and when it depends on the swings to find the other direction which I don't think we're totally there yet in most areas\nUh then we've got a problem at but\nYou know these people have so much money they sell more profit margin is more than the economy is that most country yep\nSo which is very careful about that and their interaction with our regulatory regulatory innocent in the country is is pretty lousy ah we all ... states not education and that these regulations his lawyers with a\nYou know law suits and they're they're they're a joke and they want jobs that those companies later so it's it's tough holding them accountable that's why I think the anti trust ways the only place to go and I'm Wondering what to do the judicial system or not they will handle it off\nI just worry that some day we'll have the Chinese equivalent of Amazon selling to us and it all come in a big shipping containers and say remember when we used to be able to buy from an American company called Amazon\nAction which I don't think we're totally there yet in most areas\nUh then we've got a problem at but you know these people get in touch so much money they do not profit margin is more than the economy is that most country yep\nSo where do you very careful about this\nAnd their interaction with our regulatory regulatory industries in the country is it's pretty lousy are we all all care about and for some of the United states not education and\nAre these regulations his lawyers with a you know law suits and they're they're they're a joke and they want jobs that those companies later so it's it's tough to hold them accountable that's why I think the anti trust ways no place to go and I'm Wondering what to do the judicial system or not they'll handle at all\nI just worry that Sunday will have the Chinese equivalent of Amazon selling to us and it'll all come in a big shipping containers and say remember when we used to be able to buy from an American company called Amazon and that one line from\nYou know a big company in China unless we could figure out a way to say you can't sell into our marketplace which so far we have not done Michael Doherty is the author of the devil inside the beltway the shocking expose a of the U.S government surveillance an overreach into cyber security medicine to small business Michael it's a pleasure to have you on the program\nWho accused ... of justice Cavanaugh I'm of doing to her what Bill Clinton did to Paula Jones as governor of the United but of of of the state of Arkansas\nUm he was sued when he was president of the United states and money was president of the United states Gloria Steinem oh laughed it off he took no for an answer who cares if he whipped it out to an underlying as governor of the state\nSo maybe we can at least get Gloria Steinem under oath to explain why um it is just qualifying for a drunken college freshman to do that something I don't think anyone believes Brett Kavanaugh ever did\nAnd there are certainly no corroboration evidence witnesses were contemporaneous statements to back it up\nA book but in theory what the accusation was something that it's just qualifying for drunk college freshman to do but hey okay for a governor a of a state in the United states to do and\nI'm the first accuser the one who's um testimony was what was supposed to be believable because people watched her\nAnd wow she sure looks credible to me\nUm but hadn't mentioned it to anyone for Thirty years\nAnd what do you do when no one back\nIt up at me and what about that front door she she had a front door because the two front doors because the trauma everyone looked at at the house\nThis is a very expensive neighborhood she lives in um she had said that she rent they rent out in an apartment in Google employees or interns as she called them oh I think those interns are paying a pretty penny for that that isn't a front door to her house it seems perfectly clear that is a door to a rental\nHe's Asian was something that it's just qualifying for drunk college freshman to do but hey okay for a governor a of a state in the United states to do and I'm the first accuser the one who's um testimony was was was supposed to be believable because people watched her\nAnd wow she sure looks credible to me\nUm but hadn't mentioned it to anyone for Thirty years\nAnd what do you do when no one to back\nIt up I mean what about that front door she she had a front door because at two front doors because the trauma everyone looked at at the house\nThis is a very expensive neighborhood she lives in um she had said that she rent they rent out in an apartment and Google employees or interns as she called them oh I think those ... are paying a pretty penny for that that isn't a front door to her house it seems perfectly clear that as a door to a rental apartment\nThat's a lie under oath or fear of flying um that certainly seems to me to be false and as much as she ... jets all over the globe to go surfing um\nWho paid for the for the polygraph while I guess she corrected that one or whether she'd ever coached anyone on a polygraph or live in six your ex boyfriend says that he was present when she was coaching one of her friends on how to take a polygraph something she was asked about under oath and denied um you know the next the next hearing\nOn the next Supreme Court justice to go and and be replaced and I have a few guesses about who that might be um it's it's going to be it's going to be an absolute this it will make Kavanaugh look like a day at the beach\nAnd what's the thinking I mean I'm just to some extent using prosecutors and just talking about the more local cases are afraid\nTo do this for fear of being accused by the me too crowd of you're attacking women know you're attacking a liar you're attacking a writer so so what will it take to get those people to get a backbone and say we will go after every truly guilty sex offender in America but if you lie and tried to\nFalsely accused somebody you too will phrase consequential\nNo in fact I think they should face the consequences of what they were accusing the other person of um false accusations of rape have sense have sent innocent men to prison on while I'm there's gotta be some some repercussions for that\nWell and and but where do you see the venue for being able to do I mean I'd like to do it\nBut how do we do it I mean do you put pressure on the local prosecutor who's got the call it's not often as often gonna be a federal cases a local case so how do we get this to change to where we we said this is part of taking users way that we take your ... your true accusations so seriously\nThat when we find a ... one we're right through equally hard how do we get that dynamic to ship because right now I think most prosecutors would rather do anything in the world in and go after a full ...\nAnd as you indicate it's other mad this idea oh we don't want to discourage\nFalse accusers from coming forward no actually we do want to discourage that we don't want people to live as being real and um but you're right there's this feeling that you're going against actual rape victims um if you go after false accusers of rape um there's a there's a movie out now about Brian\nBanks at an eighth a I'm\nReally bright had a bright future when he was falsely accused of rape in highschool served five years in prison [noise]\nUm got out and his accuser called I Apologize to them and said she made it up I guess he got it on tape he got the conviction or race they made a movie about it but unfortunately it came out in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings so it's gotten\nAnything in the world and go after a fall took user\nIs and as you indicate it's other men idea oh we don't want to discourage false accusers from coming forward no actually we do want to discourage that\nWe don't want people to live as being real and um but you're right there's this feeling that you're going against actual rape victims um if you go after false accusers of rape um there's a there's a movie out now about Brian Banks at an eighth a\nI'm really bright had a bright future when he was falsely accused of rape in highschool served five years in prison [noise]\nUm God out his accuser called I Apologize to them and said she made it up I guess he got it on tape he got the conviction or race they made a movie about it but unfortunately it came out in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings\nSo it's gotten a zero press that's this guy Brian Banks I tweeted a review of the movie um yesterday I'm but I'm dying to see it I've just I've just read the review um kingdom at this guy's life completely I mean it's a horrible horrible thing that's being done and there has to be consequences for it\nWell I'm going to do this and the next time I talked to any politician either so they're all I'm undecided them would you like to see us go after the\nFall accusers justice as to as tough as we go after those who are making a legitimate one her

and get violent\nWhat am I talking about\nBelieve women women must be heard how many times that we hear that during the Kavanaugh hearings how big of a why\nIs that did they listen to the women that stood up for a judge Kavanaugh that were friends with him in high school and throughout his life new did they listen to the women that accused with\nEvidence corroborating facts Keith Ellison\nHow about the treatment that candidate zones and Ann Coulter get when they want to go speak at a campus and they get threatened and and violence breaks out Sosa women must be heard right now that's a lie\nAbout black lives matter sure\nBlack lives matter that is until a black person thinks differently just look it will Johnson just look at Kanye West\nOh yeah black lives matter hey I kind of like Trump wow you Uncle Tom\n...\nAnother ally of the left but you know I was thinking about this last night\nAnd I'm ... then the next segment I'm going to play all these clips folks that just [noise] I mean you already know it but it's like we have to put it out there into the ether so that\nIt sinks in that\nThe Democrat Party is trying to START I mean even call whenever a civil war mob rule whatever\nAn arcade violence chaos it's the destruction it's all being caused by the Democrats they know exactly what they're doing but here's the key\n[noise] because [noise]\nI tend to look at things from a psychological perspective I just can't help it and last night\nI almost [laughter] I basically had I don't want to\nI don't want to say vision I didn't have a vision but the psychology of the left became clear to me in my head in a vision\nBasically the psychology of the left imagine if you will a room full of cardboard boxes and every cardboard box or you're in a left his mind every cardboard box represents\nA an individual\nSo let's say your a gay person well the left puts\nYou in a box you see\nThis is the left this box for gay people\nAnd everything that they believe about gay people exist in that box and every gay person must exist in that box okay let's move on a black man let's say All right they got a black man in a box the black man must think this way they must have Trump they must have this they must field is\nYeah that's a great picture that is a left his mind right there it is a room full of boxes\nRoom full of taped up cardboard boxes now what does this mean and this means that they're ... they're close minded this means they have no room for growth they have no room for expansion and they're in\nBox represents a an individual\nSo let's say you're a gay person well the left puts you in a\nBox you see this is the left this box for gay people\nAnd everything that they believe about gay people exist in that box and every gay person must exist in that box\nOkay let's move on a black man let's say All right they got a black man in a box the black man must think this way they must have Trump they must have this they must feel this yeah that's a great picture\nThat is a left his mind right there it is a room full of boxes\nA room full of taped up cardboard boxes now what does this mean this means that if they are closed minded which means they have no room for growth they have no room for expansion and their entire mental makeup is one hundred percent based off of\nIdentity which they then put into a box and stack up neatly in their mind\nSo okay white male [laughter] they go into the white mailbox oh racist you know big it all the other things that is unless they come out as a good liberal and then all of a sudden the whole box thing kind of just just fades away and it just oh except in you know are\nGuilty until proven Democrat\nTo the left his mind is just boxes stacked on top of one another of every identity and race and person and whatever and it's just there and it's permanent and it static and the boxes can never\n... you know go into one another because they've created lines\nSo you can't [noise] more ideas people can never come together because they have 'em all in these boxes and that's the only way that they think people can coexist is if everyone is in their nice little box\nAnd then they can stack 'em up and have everybody in their nice box and then virtue signal and social justice warrior the entire thing\nSo just imagine that\nThat is a leftist brain that is a left this psychology every person is put into a box and if you don't fit in that box they freak out it's honestly like a next level of OCD it probably is some next higher levels\nSocial level of OCD they have like a social OCD\nWhere everyone has to exist in their little boxes and they have to put these little boxes in perfect order and if anybody steps outside of the box if anybody poke so in a box to look at what might be on the other side they totally panic and their entire psychology breaks down into madness and hysteria that's what we're seeing folks\nBecause their psychology of everyone being in a box is not reality and so now they're seeing this all black people think differently white people are not racist like all of this crap and they don't know what to do because in their mind every once in a box and stacked away Perfectly Imperfect on Earth like an OCD persons desk\nIt's like imagine walking up to an obesity persons desk and you know pushing the St Louis or the other side and then they get back and they're like oh we got out in my state will get on the right side of ... who is going on and then they have like a panic in a breakdown everybody knows people like this it's a mental thing it's a psychological thing people have been diagnosed with these things people know that they're OCD\nThat's left his mind and so as soon as you go into the left his mind\nBlack people think differently white people are not racist like all of this crap and they don't know what to do because in their mind every once in a box and stacked away Perfectly Imperfect order like an OCD persons desk\nIt's like imagine walking up to see the person has to ask and you know pushing the St Louis or the other side and then they get back and they're like oh we got out in my state will get on the right side of ... who is going on and then they have like a panic in a breakdown everybody knows people like this it's a mental thing it's a psychological thing people have been diagnosed with these things people know that they're OCD\nThat he left his mind and so as soon as you go into the left his mind\nCNN causing racial division here's Bernie Sanders causing um you know economic division you know fight back mobilize a now let's go to Hillary Clinton who just goes foreign let's have a civil war\nYou're cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back ... or the Senate that twin civility can start again that the threat of terror only thing that the Republican seemed to recognize and respect strength\nThat is a threat of terrorism you better vote Democrats in or we're going to continue to be violent Hillary Clinton just threatened domestic terrorism Hillary Clinton just called for a civil war\nThank you can't be civil with Republican yeah go out beat him kill him stop him check 'em oh wait Hillary didn't say kick him that was Eric Holder\nSays you know when they go low [laughter] [noise]\nThey go low we can\nSo there's all the ... that just from this week that it from this week the Democrats calling for racial division the Democrats calling for economic division the Democrats calling for civil war the Democrats calling from violent literally and that just this week just this week but then you say\nYou guys need to calm down you guys are out of

McConnell has done and it's just wrong [noise]\n\nThem in the constitution you can protest whenever and wherever you want and\nWe may not again through go put it into my house in protest memory

that just a good time in really good time I've been to dozens of 'em the fat and\nThen what I say the Trump rally as an angry mob was not as loving people don't try one it's a great time but then

probably Democrat domestic terror\nNow\nObviously there's a lot of secret until about the radical Islamic terror cells that exist in this country that are just waiting to be activated\nLike the one that got caught in New Mexico that nobody reported on where they killed a kid and they were training kids chewed up school yep so I mean [noise] but these people\nAre foaming at the mouth and their leaders are telling them to go out and commit acts of violence so I mean seriously this is a serious question what is a greater threat to our homeland radical Islamic tear or Democrat domestic tear I think right now it's probably Democrat domestic there\nBut\nLeave it to the left wing media in this country to say that they're not an angry mob now we played that clip over and over so I'm not going

saying\nAmerican music awards ratings plummet to record low as entertainers push politics really the overall story is just people were done with Hollywood and their their culture and all the nonsense they push but it's funny 'cause\nAh Taylor Swift hosted this and so people are saying oh it was Taylor Swift politics and her comments that crush the ratings the ratings were all going to be down anyway Taylor Swift didn't help but isn't it convenient\nAnd I'm not going to call out some other artists here that did this too but I'm telling you that there's a pattern once these artist finished their North American leg of their tours\nAs soon as they play their last North American show they all have come out and made a negative Trump comment or or or negative conservative comment and it's usually pretty guarded it's usually not very extreme and you can tell it's probably tongue in cheek and they maybe don't even mean it\nBut they figure oh I'm going to say this as I'm leaving North America and I'll get some pub I'll get some headline and maybe I'll drop some energy before I leave America but so just understand that the ratings for the AM age would have tanked anyway whether the Taylor Swift made those comments or not\nBut she only made those comments to to ... she thought get some sort of windfall to her to her as she leaves America and that she was about to host the ... so it's all fake with\nThese people sadly\nAmerican flag backlash could hurt first man at the box office no it it's the anti American sentiment coming from the\nHollywood culture that's going to hurt the box office it doesn't matter it's the same thing with Taylor Swift\nThe DNA ratings were already gonna be down because people are sick of the entertainment industry telling us how to think and feel and lying to us\nTaking the propaganda just like Hollywood no one was going to go see first man whether they put the American flag on the moon or not more people will probably go because of the

I'm not you know I'm a really have a great balance that I've been an elite athletes However I'm the kind of person who will kick the couch leg when I've seen it a thousand times and uh I ran out of my age he cares because I didn't plan ahead and for a couple of days I didn't have it and I actually hurt my pope pretty badly kicking it on the couch\nThe pain in my house for a year so I Know it's there thought there but the little bit of cleanliness I just kind of realized that it and it came it crept back then but um that was the only I think it must last even after it wears off right\nYour mother only has benefiting after you know you you get a little bit benefit I'm fortune leaves the majority you wears off after five and a half hours that would be nice if we could\nJust longer but um yeah actually I'm just a cost to question it helps with general overall balance so if the flirt he is good this week she is good\nOr violence is much better and I'm going to say not only physical balance that emotional violence as well so\nYou know what ... does is just absolutely amazing I'm the only thing that I was looking for when I was studying it is so I wanted to work as well as admiral which would mean essentially just do from Maine and turn on the ...\nI think a lot even after it wears off right after you get a little bit benefit unfortunately the majority is it\nWears off after five and a half hours that would be nice if we could\nGet it longer but um yeah actually I Am just because I asked the question it helps with general overall balance so if the polarity is good this week she is good\nOur balance it's much better and I'm going to say not only physical balance that emotional violence as well so\nI don't know what had cared does is just absolutely amazing um 'cause the only thing that I was looking for when I was studying it is so I wanted to work as well as admiral\nWhich would mean essentially just do put me in and turn on the ... cortex a budget is done so much more that it's just a continues to amaze me\nI'm Wondering about that flex training and seen it correctly but I even get that towards the afternoon and I think on my sugar level are drawn in on that and I started looking at numbers you know when I turn them around\nSo dyslexia is I'm a centrally related to\nPolarity switching and very often dyslexia is a code more but uh I'm a occurrence with ADD you give them the uh add care the polarity comes on their eyes brighten\nTheir face becomes more balance dyslexia drops away not bad\nNot bad at all or could I tried that what you were just talking about ... to the right knee always\nHell no so you need a high end to brain Jim any kind of body talk any kind of apply to use the olive tree and sports in general would be extremely helpful\nOkay that's real good can you um okay thank you [laughter] I\nI had when I wasn't really vital may I just really quickly say one thing about it wouldn't eat it may I don't know okay okay um I tend to have\nFacial picks and I'm not sure why I've heard it's a little bit of magnesium a deficiency and they literally have disappeared and so that's something people can be really unpaid about their lives cause it to me it was very socially\nProblematic so that's what I Do think\nIt's a really an ultimate grabbing so one of the things that people looked at with ADD is a supposed to be doping mean related\nSo if you have more doping mean that goes away I don't find that what I find is the job is always lo and ... neuro transmitters that slows neural firing and calms you down\nAnd that so if you have to um not enough ... you would kind of seizure\nUm and seizures takes a lot of different forms and six is kind of one of those and so I'm One of the things that uh that ad carrier provides\nIs it boosts up GOP\nNow sometimes not enough to do the whole job with the capsules we actually put some guy but in the capsule form but it does have that tendency to help with ...\nWell I I I just couldn't make the connection mhm well that's a really hard thing for people to deal with I think as much as anything can be even worse because he can't function in social situations but the little mini theaters happenings\nAbsolutely what we did when we went for the patents is um we the patents states that it helps with ADD depression anxiety\nThe antics is kind of one of those and so I'm One of the things that uh that ad carrier provides is it boosts a cop out\nNow sometimes not enough to do the whole job with the capsules we actually put some guy but in the capsule form but it does have that tendency to help with ...\nWell I I I guess the connection mhm well that's a really hard thing for people to deal with I think as much as anything can be even worse because he can't function in social situations but the little mini theaters happening\nAbsolutely what we did when we went for the patents is um we the patent states that it helps with ADD depression anxiety OCD general memory\nMenopausal symptoms or an autistic spectrum disorder um\nAnd a lot of different things and we knew the worst there were some others we can put it in there but it seems really expensive but we get that kind of reaction so we didn't study for a autistic spectrum but we've had a number of people um with that condition\nTry it and say that they've noticed I'm a vast improvement which is really interesting\nWell it's like ... you have any idea why it was like ... tell me that maybe I ... yeah but now it's a special thing okay\nSo to threats actually they look at that as as a former slight form of corrupt and it happens a lot with ADD\nSo basically what what Ayman feels is the de de de is a small grades seizure disorders so you just kind of our our the way that I describe it um 'cause we go back to polarity polarity is do you control electrical magnetic current and the body going at full force\nAnd what happens is there is so much power with people with ADD that it creates a um a\nA a flickering in the electrical system and so sometimes they're on and sometimes they're often sometimes they have the kind of dangerous reactions and flashes of brilliance which was really and\nThank you I Know [laughter] and all our Jimmy I [laughter] I thought yes last weekend\nWe decided well I was over a body type thing and and uh I I adopted Laura's my official\nSister have [laughter] just you know certainly actually that if they ask 'em [laughter] and the house that kind\nOf a mind that comes up with different things in a flash and that is so typical of ADD and usually you only hear about the negative part which is too bad\nGuy like lady and I also want to do that it's like a function\nAnd accomplish things and this the adult makes me want to wipe out the inside of my refrigerator yeah which is not helpful because it's not that let their priority and with the aid they care I don't find myself literally cleaning out the freezer I find myself working on not valuable projects for the world\nNot is there anything different than nothing stimulating about it so it doesn't have any kind of a negative um there was a question here about which products so the nice thing is that uh the homeopathic blend has been every product so it would help\nWith anyone at any time now having said that mood care we put in five H. T. P. in St john's so it's geared towards either general suppression or limit Cady which was depression\nAnd ADD so you kinda have to look\nIt's like a function and accomplish things and this the other old makes me want to wipe out the inside of my refrigerator yeah which is not so helpful because it's not that let through a priority it was it eighty they care I don't find myself literally cleaning out the freezer I find myself working on a lot love valuable projects for the world\nNot very big difference and nothing stimulating about it so it doesn't have any kind of of negative um there was a question here about which province to the nice thing is that uh the homeopathic blend has been every product so it would help\nWith anyone at any time now having said that I moved here we put in five they keep you sane drawn so it's geared towards either general suppression war limbic ADD which was depression\nAnd ADD\nSo you kind of have to look at the ingredients and but it's pretty much self explanatory subjects they're\nUsed for OCD or over focused ADD memory terrorists dress or general performance um of one so in terms of sports that would probably be about the best ones that although we didn't put garlic in it and and that still might be in the desert would be good\n\nFor almost a yeah we're almost done do you have any other questions for just\nI don't think I Do I you know I Love how really the food and I'm always looking at it and say how how could this is so good you know I think you answer that I'm thank you are making the good stuff\n[laughter] and that's when the thank you so much during the ...\nBecause of the wonderful I think you you too\nSo we're almost out of time Jeff I Can't believe are half hour I had really found by gun goes real quick so she yes it does so what do you want to leave our listeners with this morning\nSo the big thing that I Would look to use um there's a tendency to look a unique kind of problem as something\nHorrible and you know everything has a really positive and negative component to it and what you really want to do is just try to maximize whatever each him and you know what tends to keep people away from treatment with ADD or depression\nOr anything else is the idea that they don't want to be labeled um you know\nIt's it's just and I'll warn concepts if you have an issue you might as well to deal with it and you can usually deal with it naturally and keep all the good stuff and just get some extra stuff\nOh great thank you so much just for for being with us this morning Jamie do you have anything else\nJust that it is always a pleasure having you here and I learned so much from you and it's one of my favorite topics and things to do with a thank you so much for being here and\nWe will be back soon I'm ... and our next half with doctors summer talking about his products memory revitalize there and just remind everyone again pleases it's so important um Saturday nine thirty to for thirty we've got our\nWe will be back soon I'm with an R next halfway doctors center talking about trying it memory red light there and just remind everyone that again please so important um Saturday nine thirty to forty hour\nBut for the past thirty five years or the theory has been what's called the beta amyloid ... are you familiar with that at all\nNo how smart about it\nYeah okay um when you look at the old timers brand under a microscope seat to landmarks one are called ... tangles and the other one's called amyloid plaques and when they analyze the amyloid plaques\nThere's beta amyloid than it and uh what's interesting is is that they noticed a long time ago Trice only a Twenty one a Down syndrome very frequently will have a problem with becoming a poor memory and look like the mantra in their fifties\nAnd so the thinking was was well okay it is a genetic disorder because we know Down syndrome is and uh it's a protein and you get your proteins or you know from your your inheritance other words your DNA\nAnd so for the past thirty five years the whole target has been to get rid of the beta amyloid that sit men to pray and they think that the plaque that this year under the microscope\nIs toxic and it can cause a neurons to die and therefore progress\nAnd they have spent at this point over a hundred billion dollars between the government spending and the pharmaceutical spending [noise] looking for this magic bullet that's going to cure Alzheimer's but the as you've noticed they've come up empty handed right\nOh yeah\nI mean the number of studies have been just really stunning now when I looked at this back in the nineties I said look you look at these plaques are sitting in the brain and to me that reminded me of tombstones what they did was they mark were dead neurons had been laid to rest and\nI've got to ask you guys how often the people die of tombstones\n\nIn actual fact in two thousand Fifteen a couple of kids were fiddling around to the grave site the tombstone go over and killed one so it does happen but it's exceedingly rare\nAnd it turns out that genetic old timers is exceedingly rare when they started off on this quest back in the eighties and nineties there thought was sure we we will find the magic Jean and when we find the magic Jane all we have to do is all through that and then you you don't get all timers but\nWhen I looked at this back in the nineties I said look you look at these plaques are sitting in the brain and to me that reminded me of tombstones what they did was they mark were dead neurons had been laid to rest and I got to ask you guys how often do people die of tombstones\n\nIn actual fact in two thousand Fifteen a couple of kids were fiddling around to the grave site the tombstone fell over and killed one so it does happen but it's exceedingly rare\nAnd it turns out\nThat genetic old timers is exceedingly rare when they started off on this quest back in the eighties and nineties\nThere thought was sure we we will find the magic Jean and when we find the magic gene all we have to do is all through that and then you you don't get all timers but does it make sense that you would get a gene birth and then that gene wouldn't go off for Seventy or eighty years\nRight no of course not you know I mean if you've got a bad\nGenetic problem is going to be their birth and should be manifest within the first couple of years of life not wait\nFor Seventeen years so as a matter of fact that's kind of ... you know do you remember Sigmund forward right Mm yeah yeah he was basic tenet was who was all moms fault\nThey're blaming on mom right you know the fact you're nervous blame\nIt on mom the fact you're depressed and that hasn't really worked out too well it's turned out that most psychiatric problems or do have a biochemical basis\nBut let's go back to this innocent bystander thing where we look at these amyloid plaques and we say my gosh these things are are causing you know terrible damage to the brain\nAnd it what's the fallacy what's the what's the you know problem with logic and and it actually has a name was called the innocent bystander a fallacy and here's how it works and let me ask you is it not true that police cars cause all motor vehicle accidents\nWould you accept that as a true statement yeah you would\nThat all all motor vehicle accidents are caused by police\nCars and wind [laughter] no it isn't it it is it's it's it's\nThe innocent bystander fallacy it's because when you go by an accident where do you see you see a police car\nRight so you make the association between accidents and police cars you say well police cars must be causing accidents are very highly yeah\nSo this is the same thing they look at the bird amyloid plaque and that's the markers or says this is an all time his brain and they say\nThat police car beta amyloid must be causing the old timers and they have put like a hundred billion dollars in two ways of preventing it and what happens is what happens when you disturbed grapes well you know and you get the zombie apocalypse things go bad right\nAnd they have made these really elegant drugs that they give people and a goodly percentage of them who want to have what is called an ... it's an increase in inflammation in the brain and I've seen a couple of these patients\nAnd what happens is they progress in weeks and months what would normally take years to progress\nAnd so they have let the genie out of the grave they've let the genie out of the tombstone and made things worse and that's why you know they're searching for these things and perhaps that's part of the excitement for my small publication here recently [noise]\nYou know let's take a look at um the heavy metal ... do you remember the old thing of aluminum\nAnd when you disturbed grapes well you know and you get dissolve the apocalypse things go bad right\nAnd they have made these really elegant drugs that they give people and a goodly percentage of them who want to have what is called in several light is it's an increasing and inflammation in the brain and I've seen a couple of these patients\nAnd what happens is they progress in weeks and months what would normally take years to progress\nAnd so they have let the genie out of the grave they've let the genie out of the tombstone and made things worse and that's why you know they're searching for these things and perhaps that's part of the excitement for my small publication here recently\nYou know let's take a look at um the heavy metal ... do you remember the old thing of aluminum causes old timers\nYeah but that's aluminum as a heavy metal what about mercury while you're out it\nCauses you to be mad as a hat or because they used to ... a leather as with mercury and a mercury is a heavy metal aluminum mercury lead zinc all of these heavy metal is if you put them in the body guess where they go locate\nThat go up to the brain yeah\nAnd they they hang out in a small organ inside the nerve so it's called the mitochondria\nAnd I'm going to get around to why this is important for memory revitalize or the couple of minutes but uh the the thing is these heavy metals or put inside the mitochondria and then they spend electrons off of it to create energy and it's the energy that makes the nerve cell function\nAnd again let's look at the brain the brain is the two pound organ in a hundred and fifty pound body\nSo it represents about one percent were less than one percent of the body weight and yet it burns twenty percent of the body energy\nIf you want to lose weight start thinking more okay and it puts trees [laughter] true it's true or the other thing that goes on as it gets twenty percent of the cardiac output so you know it's the queen of the organs and the thing is is that is a high energy thing\nAnd how do you get the energy well you take the heavy metals you put it in the mitochondria the nurse cells and you've got a huge amount of energy can spin off but when a nerve cell blows up where does heavy metal goats highly toxic mercury is highly toxic\nAnd work goes into the ... space and in the ... space and an ass environment over blown up neuron there's only one compound in the body that will go in sweep it up and put it into a nice little pile and isolated you know what that is\nThat's beta amyloid\nSo the job of beta amyloid is to gather the heavy metals that are loose\nIn the brain and keep them from hurting you more\nSo it's actually a defense mechanism that the body has it's not the cause um and that's further exciting now what we have said is you know what I've had pasta size and I had a two thousand and four paper in the journal of alternatives deceased saying hey garden going the wrong direction guys\nLinus Pauling was right it's all due to oxidative injury it's due to free radicals being turned loose in the body and if you give high dose antioxidants by golly you can actually reverse all summers\nAnd when I put in the patent for memory revitalize or you have to have a an important part of a patent is you have to give a practical use for it you can't say this is a really neat where'd you that nobody ever made before\nLoose in the brain and keep them from hurting you more\nSo it's actually a defense mechanism that the body has it's not the cause um and that's where they're exciting now what we have said it is you know what I've hypothesized that had a two thousand and four paper in the journal of all time is deceased saying hey garden going the wrong direction guys\nLinus Pauling was right it's all due to oxidative injury it's due to free radicals being turned loose in the body and if you give high dose antioxidants by golly you can actually reverse all summers and\nWhen I put in the patent for memory revitalize or you have to have a an important part of a patent is you have to give a practical use for it you can say this is a really neat where did you that nobody ever made before but if the which it doesn't do anything practical the patent office will not permitted\nWell are useful in the U.S was that it would actually reverse our state of injury to the brain hands would be useful for newer cognitive disorders like Parkinson's are all timers\nNow here's the problem you can ... you have to say that to the patent office but when you go around over to the uh FDA and you're saying I have a health supplement you have to put the little label on the side of the bottle you you know that one you've seen it right\nThis products is not intended to\nPrevent or treat any known illness right\nSo it's kind of a you know catch twenty two year patents says the purpose in usefulness of memory revitalize there is there would prevent and actually help all the time it was but on the other hand you can't advertise that way\nSo let's take a look at the process that leads to alter cameras first off it's a disease of aging it is not the disease of genetics because they're

can do what we do can you imagine that we're in the greatest country in the world [noise] it's crazy bitcoins trading real quick before we get to a sixty two eleven has dropped a little bit thank goodness look at this while\nI like it when it drops so I'm looking at some of the exchanges two hundred and twenty two bitcoin a hundred and Seventy six Seventy two forty eight thirty to those are different amounts of bitcoin that was traded on some of these exchanges so far in the last twenty minutes let's see what his traded so far this show started right here\nBy looking at is traded about thirty three by looking at that I Can't wait we get to do this started three point eight five million dollars thirty three point eight million dollars traded in the last ten or Fifteen minutes\nOr since the show started we're going to have it and you got to get this that's\nThe last twenty four hours it's only traded a couple of hundred thousand plus she had me a couple of hundred million were traded thirty three million so far since the show started that's not bad that means you guys are buying up there I Would you know it's ... it's the ... were pop thirty grand this morning but\nI'm going to go over one of the trades tank so today you can buy a bit cornered about sixty two hundred and eleven dollars and thirty cents Thirteen cents sixty two eleven Thirteen as if we were speaking it changed again it changes all the time and so we've had the first drop in price about three hundred dollars\nIn the last two days now and that's good so we're now we're getting back to some trading even though it slowed down today sixty two eleven Thirteen right now so let's say\nWe take a bitcoin now when you give your money\nTo a and there's a lot of great financial advisors a lot of good stockbrokers there's a lot of good companies I talk about Charles Schwab all the time I like Charles Schwab they're one of my heroes or one of my favorite people out there I'm not heroes but they're one of my favorites out there\nThey they're the largest brokerage firm in the world they have over two trillion dollars under management there are good company right there you you know decide what you want to do when you when you hire a broker\nBut they do good work out there I've used them in the past and um\nBut the um let's say you take a coin Kate which is sixty two hundred dollars here's what I'm going to do\nHere's what I Do I take about Seventy percent of that and I keep it after I buy it then I said I put it into other coins\nAnd then I trade those other coins\nThen because of their ... tile which means you can make some good money on their moving tank and\nThen I switched it back to a big one and I'm always keeping that going on a daily basis but let me give the simplest terms okay\nSo let's say like this morning I might've trade for thirty thousand dollars ... which is a small trade oh boy look at this and trying to get in there we go okay so it's a small trade thirty thousand dollars but let's say there's\nTen of you're doing six thousand that sixty two or six hundred dollars\nHer broker but they do good work out there I've used them in the past and um but the um let's say you take a coin K which is sixty two hundred dollars here's what I'm gonna do\nHere's what I Do I take about Seventy percent of that and I keep it after I buy it then I said I put it into other coins and then I trade those other coins\nAnd then because of their ... tile which means you can make some good money on their moving tank\nThen I switched it back to a big one and I'm always keeping that going on a daily basis but let me give the simplest terms okay so let's say like this morning I made a trade for thirty thousand dollars ... which is a small trade\nOh boy look at this and trying to get in there we go okay so it's a small trade thirty thousand dollars but let's say there's\nTen of you're doing six thousand that sixty two uh sixty two hundred dollars right sixty two thousand dollars so imagine this\nI talked to a guy to people yesterday and I'll go over some of that in a minute but sixty two hundred dollars\nOn one trade six thousand two hundred dollars on one trade if you make one percent on that a day doesn't sound like a lot but it's sixty two dollars and that's not hard to make one percent not hard to make one percent\nNow the the more people always try to talk to a guy yesterday said his daddy always\nUh bought high solo [laughter]\nIt's the opposite you sell high and then you buy low in the debt okay but people get nervous and then they don't get nervous\nWhen you give your money to a brokerage firm\nWhat does that broke her do if they are they working for you or are they working for the farm they work for the from not you they get paid to sell you there's nothing wrong with that that's business one oh one that's how they bring in the money they bring in the clients and the customers by selling you there\nAre services they make a commission off the top\nThen they put you into some kind of bond whatever it is and then they institutionally buy and sell bats fun so they've got a hundred thousand of you into a fond\nUnless they each of you put in ten dollars that's a million dollars they're going to take that million dollars then they're going to trade that bond daily\nSo let's say they make one percent on that\nOne percent of the million dollars is what ten thousand dollars if you make ten thousand dollars a day do the math on at ten thousand 'cause they're trading by the way the financial institutions are trading after hours and Saturday and Sunday you can only trade Monday to friday during operating hours\nTen thousand a day at three hundred and sixty five days a year they're going to take that million and they're going to turn it into about three and a half million dollars three point six million dollars in a year just on one percent just on one percent\nI take that same strategy as the institutional buyers and the institutional sours\nYou can't compete against institutional buyers you cannot compete against institutional ... hours when they tell you something for example when they come out on the news\nAny news Fox News CNBC in MSNB it doesn't matter ABC CBS when these guys come out and tell you something that's because they have all ready done it\nAnd then like then they what they do they influence the people because that's how it works and then you make your decisions on whether you want to buy and sell and get scared and whatever staying stay where you're at I highly recommend you never buy or sell based on the news so pick a couple of\nJust on one percent just on one percent\nI take that same strategy as the institutional buyers and the institutional sours\nYou can't compete against institutional buyers you cannot compete against institutional ... hours when they tell you something for example when they come out on the news any news\nFox News CNBC in MSNB it doesn't matter ABC CBS when these guys come out and tell you something that's because they have all ready done it\nAnd then like then they what they do they influence the people because that's how it works and then you make your decisions on whether you want to buy and sell and get scared and whatever staying stay where you're at I highly recommend you never buy or sell based on the news\nSo pick a couple of coins now we're less dot crypto because I don't have a very modest claim or I don't have a theory sex\nOr series seven licence so I'm not doing the stock market we're not doing security we're doing crypto it's unregulated over here I can buy for myself I could buy for you\nIt's unregulated unlicensed with the state of Arizona we just are are now working on getting a different type of license so I can be a custodian I Am already a custodian but I can work on being a large a custodian on one of the exchanges where the exchange will\nFDIC your money which means they federally a secure your money it's it's the insured any cash\nAnd then also to the coin because they're billionaires mayor billionaire partners\nThey self fund any corn that might get stolen off the exchange which is super cool right I mean it's just fantastic there's not an exchange out there that'll do that but there's one out there I won't mention who it is but we're partnering with them and I'm very excited to see that happen\nBut anyway let's say you're trading I'm trading a million dollars a day ... million coin today and I make one percent one percent\nThat's it that's it so today bitcoin mood what bitcoin moved sixty two hundred do the math it uh ten percent would be about six hundred and the last ... moved about five percent\nSo when you're only trading one percent you're in and out of the markets that one percent that is a very low risk conservative you have to be happy with making your one percent\nI was talking earlier today about sixty two hundred dollars so let's say you make sixty to hunt you take your sixty two hundred and you try it and you make your one percent of the day\nThat sixty two dollars it doesn't sound like a lot but if you do that three hundred and sixty five days a year you make yourself an extra twenty two thousand so you just now made three hundred and fifty percent on your money\n\nI don't know anybody who couldn't use an extra five ten thousand dollars a year these are very low risk conservative\nMoves in my personal opinion that's why you should put pen to paper\nSee what you got I was talking to somebody yesterday we did it trade and it wasn't my money it was his he was asking me about it and I told them by the way have you set pen to paper every talk to your financial advisor they said yes they said don't do it\nDon't do what don't do crypto currency yet don't do crypto currency I said okay what kind of return they'd given you how well first of all did you ask your financial advisor in their personally in debt\nThese are very low risk conservative\nMood in my personal opinion that's why she put pen to paper\nSee what you got I was talking to somebody yesterday we did it trade and it wasn't my money it was here he was asking me about it and I told them by the way have you set pen to paper every talk to your financial advisor they said yes they said don't do it\nDon't do what don't do crypto currency yeah don't do crypto currency I said okay what kind of return and they give you ... first was did you ask your financial advisor it there personally in debt\n... and I'm going to put them away into a store it's going to be safe\nI'm going to take that other Seventy thousand and I'm going to trade on that daily Seventy thousand now on that Seventy thousand looking at bitcoin only has to go up one percent on that Seventy thousand but let's divide that out\nDivided by a sixty two hundred and fifty dollars right now that the lemon point to bitcoin so let's just take the lemon bitcoin okay so Lebanon bitcoin at sixty two hundred dollars it only has to go up one percent\nGang which is not very much about sixty two bucks okay but let's say a it goes up a one percent so sixty two hundred\nTimes one percent it sixty two dollars you take your eleven times sixty two what does that give you use your six hundred and eighty two dollars it doesn't sound like a lot right it doesn't sound like a lot at all matter of fact that sounds like pathetic do that for three hundred times a year\nYou want to know the magic figure on that\nAre you ready to hundred thousand dollars two hundred and forty eight thousand dollars\nWow\n\nEleven times sixty two is six hundred dollars loops times three hundred and sixty five two hundred and forty eight thousand dollars\n... ... ... ... ... ...\nThree hundred percent on your money if it just goes one percent\nSo when you say that that doesn't sound like a lot it doesn't but it adds up\nThat's why you want to be conservative with what you do the very conservative there's nothing wrong with being conservative you cannot play and you cannot compete with the big boys and the big girls once they make their announcements like Warren Buffett I Love him the one of the greatest\nInvestment traders buyers in modern history in our lifetime for sure\nSo when he buys he buys it holds as what it is so he announced that he was buying Seventy five ... death he was buying Seventy five a he was my Seventy five billion dollars\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nThat's three hundred percent on your money if it just goes one percent so when you say that that doesn't sound like a lot it doesn't but it adds up that's why you want to be conservative with what you do your very conservative there's nothing wrong with being\nConservative you cannot play and you cannot compete with the big boys and the big girl once they make their announcements like Warren Buffett I Love him the one of the greatest\nInvestment traders buyers in modern history in our lifetime for sure\nSo when he buys he buys it holds as what it is so he announced that he was buying Seventy five ... death he was buying Seventy five a he was my Seventy five billion dollars worth of\nBut guess what what do you make the announcement hit already bought it already\nWhen he made that announcement\nApple when a forty dollars that day forty dollars on a two hundred dollar trade two hundred dollar share type trade went up forty bucks day so it went up about twenty percent that day twenty percent\nDo the math on Seventy five billion dollars going up twenty percent in a day they don't do anything first and then they don't tell you and then say oh them they're going to do it they've already\nDone it\nAlready done it so anyway\nWhen they say they're gonna sail or they're gonna move these positions they've already done it\nWhen they say they're gonna sail oh I think it's a good time to sell that means they've already done it because they want you to go out in the south they want you to get scared and sale and when you sell in the price goes down twenty percent or do they do they buy it back\n\nThey buy back and not only do they gain that twenty percent back but you always goes above that they usually make twenty thirty percent maybe forty they make a fortune off you running and being scared so you cannot play with the big boys and the big girls impossible\nBut you can use their strategies and those strategies are simple\nYou take a small percentage of the day and you go home and be happy with it you may not think sixty two dollars is a lot but sixty two dollars times that eleven is six hundred and something dollars that six hundred dollars adds up to a couple of hundred thousand dollars that's a big deal\nTo the average Jane and the average Joe who leverage themselves to be leverage Jane and leverage Joe oh boy\nI'm going to get a lot I'm getting a lot of current law to let me tell you I'm getting a lot of notes\nOn this so I'll listen to this dog a little bit about something okay in Eighteen oh great Thomas Jefferson said banking establishment\nAre more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the American people ever allow\nThe banks to control the issuance of their currency first by inflation I talk about it all the time and then\nBy deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them with the pride of the people of all\nProperty it's been happening for a long time we're at the point right now we're the inflation they printed so much money there's so much debt out there that no one is willing to buy the debt anymore they've had to come up with the new system\nThe current system I'm telling you it's yours I'm sitting here is gonna crash some day I don't know when but it's gonna\nTalk a little bit about something okay in eighth grade Thomas Jefferson said banking establishment they're more dangerous Dora liberties than standing armies if the American people ever\nThe banks to control the issuance of their currency first by inflation I talk about it all the time and then by deflation the banks and corporations\nThat will grow up around them what the price of the people of all property it's been

up with the new system\nThe current system I'm telling you it's yours I'm sitting here is gonna crash some day I don't know when but it's going to crash that's why bitcoin is the people's money and I tell you what the banks have got behind it already\nYes they do you think they're going to miss out no anyway the father of the constitution James Madison said the money changers have used every form of abuse\nIntrigue deceit and violent means possible to maintain their control over government they even start wars\nAnyway we're going to get back to this on the last segment you've been listening to the Y.

West Virginia Iowa State now West Virginia is favored by two points going into Iowa State yeah and I have to go with I have to do with um I have to because I think\nThese guys are just you like I said now I Do in this game as long as there are just being in that stadium I mean we are about stadiums oh you're right there it's a it's a good team this year West Virginia's full often you gotta try yeah I Know that then you got to try and keep them off the field that's that's the only way I Would stay control you you want to get your turnovers yeah but that's all yeah\nWest Virginia is this just loaded I have an upset here yeah\nFlorida played just a a big game last week against the Dallas you they pulled it out in a couple of minutes\nI liked vanity over Florida and I'm like oh I Know\nI Know a common or is there going to Knoxville the gators are going to now that's a car I'm predicting that they would call Florida might have a little bit of all let this is just my life in Tennessee

towards him or what Texas then and plays football they're good they're good at the quarterback position they've got to speed I ... a good team\nOkay you don't want and then being on by week we're we won't talk about the issue right now they are they're on track and and I think\nThey just lay they play Stanford next Thursday so we ... yeah it's it's gonna be a good game Stanford stuff there's average coming here though I did yes yeah we've had a rough couple of weeks Stanford has but they're still really good\nThey're still really good and they're coming in ASU and issues when planes have good ball but they are this is that I Would have called the straight up even game because of the way they've been playing lately yeah ad ah rice love itself the he's the difference in the game huge All right good at it that's my deal on that call that and then ... for you pack pack twelve people\nI've got Washington at Oregon and Washington better watch out I think Oregon can give them a hard time well I\nI always talked about a noxious student body as well see you see you as one in uh Oregon is one a outs in stadium is just\nFor any visiting team it's just it's horrible I mean the desk all levels unbelievable they're loyal fans yeah and also it's an early kick for a pack twelve started noon if they don't yeah I thought that was pretty interesting it is interesting and I would have to lean on Oregon's simply because that's an early start a and it's gonna be wrapped up in that stadium in\nYou know the only time I saw that stadium quiet was during the Grateful Dead concert ... alright and it was about one in the morning so yeah you know very mellow what Anna Washington\nIs great I'm I'm trying to think of who they are running back is he's actually he'll be first email American they're very very good too but I think Oregon um\nPeople I've got Washington at Oregon and Washington better watch out I think Oregon could give them a hard time well I\nI always talked about a noxious student body as well see you see you as one in uh Oregon is one a outs in stadium is just\nFor any visiting team it's just it's horrible I mean the decibel levels unbelievable they're loyal fans yeah and also it's an early kick for a pack twelve started noon is now I thought that was pretty interesting it is interesting and I would have to lean on Oregon's simply because that's an early start a and it's gonna be wrapped up in that stadium in\nYou know the only time I saw that stadium quiet was during the Grateful Dead concert ...

that everybody all the media they got all their little talking point and there are some at the most ironic thing to me was the I because I said look at the mob and then after people got mad I said yeah by the way it's still a mob\nStill a mob of why I\nMy behavior means that the mob and and raging and cutting at me\nOver this whole thing just enhances my point further\nOr not a lot of you to

was arrested for\nDoc seeing people\nAnd even putting their threatened to put their Children's Medical records on life\nFully ... that's in the\n... and that's and Brian ... let me share with you 'cause this is this is what the media this is how they're trying to finesse and I've always had civil discussion with Brian I completely disagree with them on a number of things that I always appreciate the discussion\nBut\nHe had said and you know we went back and forth on this a little bit\nBecause I was discussing how the\n... I replied to him he the President Trump is leading hate movement against the press\nBut it's not just against the press what standout stands out to his rallies and he's quoting this piece of the New Yorker which is just a\nA really it is the two long column of my space vending it's like somebody just discovered live journal the only thing that was missing isn't a ... to correctly capture their feels that the time of writing\nAnd what they're listening to avoid it took it back to the nineties done it\nAnd he says\nSays that he is a is quoting that says well you know the president's leading hate moving against the press you know et cetera et cetera or someone who watched his rallies on TV said oh the Haitian sense of actual men is that he's trying to convey to his supporters\nAnd Arab people chanting something at a rally hence the lock her up thing when they were talking about science time\nAnd they're not going to go out and physical drag her from her home or run or at a restaurant they'll go and vote that's what they do but I said people chanting something at a rally is not comparable to stalking people in airports attacking them in their yards running them out of restaurants blocking traffic well damaging card docked in families and shooting up a congressional ball game\nThat column is just plain silly he says well there's been a rise in political violence and outrageous behavior on both right and left do you think the leader of our country is helping to calm things down [noise]\nMm well and that's when I said do you think that this began with this administration\nHe says that he is a is quoting says well you know the president's leading the hate movement against the press you know et cetera et cetera or someone who watched his rallies on T. V. said oh they hate and sense of actual men is that he's trying to convey to his supporters\nAnd Arab people chanting something at a rally hence the lock her up thing when they were talking about Feinstein\nAnd they're not going to go out and physically drag her from her home or run out of a restaurant they'll go and vote that's what they do but I said people chanting something at a rally in not comparable to stopping people and airports attacking them in their yards running them out of restaurants blocking traffic well damaging card docked in families and shooting up a congressional ball game\nThat column is just plain silly he says well there's been a rise in political violence and outrageous behavior on both are right in the left do you think the leader of our country is helping to calm things down [noise]\nMm well and that's when I said do you think that this began with its administration where are you purposely ignoring occupy Buxton\nRioters paid by more to go to Ferguson weather underground and if he blames Trump and Hillary and Booker and waters and holder and even Obama because by his logic that called for violent and I added further if we're comparing\nI have a witness and I have personally experienced way more threatened behavior from the left in the right I don't think Republicans surprise to match the tone of people like Maxine Waters or Hillary Clinton and I've always condemns when I've seen it happen\nAlways\n... and he says well I don't doubt that you are right wing fixture folks on the left personally experienced more of it from the right eye which leaders would work to make things better not worse and said I don't know anyone on the left who had to move because of repeated conservative or Republican threat\n\nAnd I don't doubt that there absolutely people on the left has endured similar but how often how severe seemed out measured [noise]\n... this is is\nI I also hope it changes I mean that's that's the thing I also hope it changes but no no no I'm not going to I'm not going to be told that well both sides no it's not\nWell what about Charlottesville they say you mean the rally that was organized by a Democrat\nThe guy who voted for Obama that racist tool bag hell yeah let's denounced that all day long I don't understand the point look here's the thing you can sit here in March with your tiki torches that you've got a Home Depot sticks with the Sunday I don't care\nI Believe in free speech even for people who speeches absolutely sounds like it's the product of into I'm totally fine with that\nGo ahead and have your free speech your peaceful free speech\nYou meet the each you don't like with more speech\nYou know someone who was who was who knew someone who knew that the people that were there that were open carrying firearms there\nUm apparently and this is what I was told by this individual who lives actually in Charlottesville\nThey were saying that those people showed up not to protect the um\nTiki torches people but to protect the counter protesters and not even because they agreed with them but because they they didn't want it to all get out of hand and they knew that that there probably wouldn't be enough resources there to stop it if it did\nAnd then you had somebody driving a car that was that a kill Heather higher which is horrible but it's like okay so an\n...\nHow was that attributed to Trump yeah and furthermore I Wish people would match my consistency or your consistency can't or other people's consistency none of these individuals\nUm apparently and this was what I was told by this individual who lives actually in Charlottesville\nThey were saying that those people showed up not to protect the um\nTiki torches people but to protect the counter protesters and not even because they agreed with them but because they they didn't want it to all get out of hand and they knew that that there probably wouldn't be enough resources there to stop it if it did\nAnd then you had somebody driving a car that was that a kill Heather higher which is horrible but it's like okay so Ann\n\nHow was that attributed to Trump yeah\nAnd furthermore I Wish people would match my consistency or your consistency can't or other people's consistency none of these individuals that all whatsoever has condemned the stuff that Hillary Clinton has that\nOr Maxine Waters they refused outright to condemn antifa\nThey have refused to condemn the protests on college campuses where people thought people in the face and burned down buildings so\nBefore you criticize why don't you match my consistency or other people consistency\n... why don't they why don't they perhaps\nMatch it but yeah the whole\nThat was because that guy was a hardcore Democrat who voted for Barack Obama did the media tell you that no\nIs anybody surprised that a guy who came from the party that was that formed or the KKK would have a tiki torches rally in Charlottesville\nIs anybody surprised at that don't believe may go Google at Washington Post wrote about a\nGood heavens yes it's horrible\nI Wonder if the people who are making a big deal out of it is they'll condemn it lasts and rightfully should be if they'll condemn it less because it was somebody of their own ideology that didn't that organized\nAnd that's the thing it's all awful so what\nDoes that give you to say the stuff that you're saying well right does it give it when this is this idea that\nUh\nSome I mean just I'm so tired of people are just like well you know which justify what we're doing\n\nWhat about when somebody made an effigy of Obama and set it on fire yeah that was that was stupid and I said the same thing when I was at a rally and I saw leftist make an effigy of Bush and set on fire to\nAn your point what's your point\nYou want to do that you know fouls measuring what about them BS all day or you can actually condemn the people that are shooting up congressional ball fields that are volunteering for the candidates you voted for\nOr how it that maybe maybe you're going to say Hillary Clinton the person that uh you know the other person that we voted for maybe she shouldn't say things like we're not going to be civil until we have power\nOr Maxine Waters you're Democrat lawmaker maybe she shouldn't go and find them where they are and make them uncomfortable run them out of the country\nOr how does maybe maybe you're going to say Hillary Clinton the person that uh you know the other person I was looking for\nMaybe you shouldn't say things like we're not going to be civil until we have power or or Maxine Waters you're Democrat lawmaker maybe she shouldn't they go and find them where they are and make them uncomfortable run them out of the country\n[noise] Hi this is Jim Clark CEO republic

five three takes eleven hundred so what else would you to ask me\nWhat should the the not seek to yet but I'm not married to somebody that's older but tell me what what what do you what is the ... that's number one question that you get about the house\nNumber one you know do you do I own a house to tell me more about it and then the other thing is it's not you know we're so used to getting a third of your mortgage which the rate that this is what do you what are you looking to do what are your goals for your plans what are you looking to do in vacation time\nAnd how can because the flexibility of those in number one the flexibility but number two is once you determine what's life like today and what we can set it up to do just what you're not done as long as there's equity you can change it\nSo you may opt to just get a monthly income for a little bit but then you can stop it or you can get some cash and then you can get summit monthly income I mean\nIt's flexible and guess what life changes right so what a beautiful thing because you set it up to do based on your knees and your goals of today and down the road life changes life shows up so\nThat's number one question that you get about the house\nNumber one you know do you do I own a house to tell me more about it and then the other thing is it's not you know we're so used to getting a third of your mortgage which the rate that's it this is what do you what are you looking to do what are your goals what are your plans what are you looking to do in your vacation time\nAnd how can because the flexibility of those in number one the flexibility but number two is once you determine what's life like today and what we can set it up to do that's why you're not done as long as there's equity you can change it\nSo you may opt to just get a monthly income for a little bit but then you can stop it or you can get some cash and then you can get ... monthly income I mean it's flexible and guess what life changes right so what a beautiful thing because you set it up today based on your knees and your goals of today\nAnd down the road life changes life shows up so let's take another look at it how could it be tailored how can it be changed defeat your goals and needs for the rest of your life\nWell I think I told you before my dad had one that works so well for us and he needed it he ended up really needing it and you know he had done well all his life but\nAh one is ... my ... my mother passed I he realized that he because you know they use more money than they thought when she was sick\nAnd then he realized that he didn't really have enough money to keep how you didn't know how long right so he that was the reason is he didn't know and so he ended up getting one and it was fine it worked great I mean you know there are certain things that when you work with someone like you that you sit down and you talk about you know what you're going to do with it right\nYeah and you know perfect the insurance companies I think all of the majority of them have now changed their actuarial tables up two hundred and twenty a hundred and Twenty one so it's like you need a plan to be a hundred and twenty and then you live like you're going to die tonight isn't that how it goes [laughter]\n[laughter] so here's the other thing too but um it's a it's a tool for a lot of people you know I'm at you've been meeting a lot of the people that have been on the show him even having fun doing that wonderful people who are a financial plan as you said that this is a tool for them it's a tool for other people go ahead\nI talked about talked to a financial planner as early this morning and yes we had a great conversation about taking the home equity in converting that into a monthly income so it's a um supplement Social Security supplemental pension\nAnd to be able to do that and really a reverse mortgages about peace of mind and quality of life\nSo taking a look at where you're at the other thing I think about it so many baby boomers that are married at least one of them still has a job\nAnd that's great for today what happens when a does debilitating income or debilitating illness occurs and they can no longer have that job what's going to supplement their income replace that income\nAnd it's better to plan now is not needed that did not have it and wish you could because when do you borrow money when you don't need it that's the perfect time\nNow in the book is called reverse mortgage three sixty is a new perspective\nAnd his website is reverse mortgage three sixty dot org

talk to people really and then find out where\nI'm going to be because ah many people get sort of dreams super imposed on them you wind up working for an organization or you're in a group practice and if you don't get much thought to it you wind up just continuing to do that\nWhen that may not be if I asked you if there were no limitations ... what would you really like to be doing ten years from now\nUm if there are no limitations it's amazing what people can come up with\nYou on the ... the other thing I find it's they think they don't have the\nTime where the energy to do a career plan and if that if you think you don't have the time or energy to do a career plan you or the person you definitely need to plan because you can't be spinning your wheels\nIf you have a little bit of time and I work with people so that we break things down into Fifteen minute or a thirty minute segments you know people have often asked me ... how did you write books and how did you write articles that did

I did all of what I did mostly in Fifteen and thirty minute segments and many people are going to school people to have the time to go to school with that person doesn't have any more time\nAnd they get a lot of complex going to school and Fifteen a thirty minute segments\nYeah it's amazing I don't know that you've got some fabulous tips to help people get to where they may want to be said to me that's what this is all about right yes\nAnd and that's so important because in today's environment\nMost people when they talk to me said they don't have anybody where they work who can help them who's done so many different things and sometimes if they do seem to have somebody they're not sure they can trust and not in a bad way but that person may let something slip that they're not going to
