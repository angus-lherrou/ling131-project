don't have the people with the skills that I've developed\nI've worked a lot of those places that I worked with people with ten or twenty years'\nSeniority being a license as a therapist legally allowed to do body work and\nThey did not even have a real grass spot in the stuff I was doing maybe they didn't do it at Twenty years longer than me and they're asking if I go work on their clients for them they were saying I Can't get rid of this lady's headaches cake or at the sky is back pain been come to me for months\nAnd can I send them to you and they're like because they knew they saw my

you give them a credit card number bank card number then yeah they only charge in Seventy nine dollars a month and you get one massage a month you know\nStill far above my fifty dollar price that I charge now because I have my own business but ah most of the other people that have been there a while they'd\nGo to the average was you know eight percent ten percent some people had twelve percent salt one person got up to like Seventeen percent of the people that worked on signed up for membership and as soon as I started working there\nAs soon as my results came out I had forty eight percent

that have had one lady a couple of months ago I mentioned this on most of my shows she had a daily headache for Eighteen years\nCame in and worked on our only for an hour out all the knots out of the upper ... all these fun muscle names around her neck and shoulders that I knew were right on that nerve that runs up into their head one of the many nerves that runs up into the head\nAnd when I got done with her she said it was bizarre because she forgot what it felt like not to have a headache for Eighteen years every day she had a headache\nI was a two and a half months ago now in her headaches and not come back\nI've had people that I've had migraines for years and years I've worked on him they come back you know sometimes they come back for monthly maintenance to a couple of times a month once a month just for keep things loosened up this lady's and come back for three months you had ... migrants for seven years\nAfter her migraines situation was and she said had not had one migraine she had a had one slight headache once and she had thrown away all her migraine medications and that's awesome that's really my goal is to get people so they don't have to live with these pains\nI've had one gentleman that had low back pain said he did he knew what he did a injured it was carrying a sack of grain down the stairs at the mill slips slid down the stairs on his back have low back pain every sentence he hadn't worked in the middle for forty years already years\nIt had back pain all the doctors all the specialist all the neurologist physical therapy everything these people had tried just once\nMaintenance a couple of times a month once a month just for keep things loosened up this lady's and come back for three months she had made migraines for seven years\nAfter her migraines situation was and she said it had not had one migraine she had I had one slight headache once and she had thrown away all her migraine medications and that's awesome that's really my goal is to get people say they don't have to live with these pains\nI've had one gentleman that had low back pain said he did he knew what he did a injured it was it was carrying a sack of grain down the stairs at the males slipped slid down the stairs on his back had low back pain every sentence he hadn't worked in the middle for forty years already years\nIt had back pain all the doctors all the specialists all the neurologist physical therapy everything these people had tried\nJust wasn't doing it\nBecause they weren't addressing where the real problem was the stuff I work\nOn the ... you can only find it by\nHuman touch you have to know where to look you have to know what's your feeling for it does not show up on our eyes that does not show up on X rays\nUnless you know what you're doing you know you're not going to fix it and it just really amazes me how people spend tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars through their insurance with all these doctors in special is trying to solve a problem and they come to me and for\nOne visit fifty bucks most of the time I can fix it and one visit some\nYou know but it doesn't always happen in just one visit sometimes people come in two times three times\nYou know to get it worked out because they didn't take adjust to an hour to get all these muscles nodded up like that normally takes years and a lot to do with your your occupation your your daily habits what you do in life how you hold your body how you hold positions of your body\n[noise] again I Do have three locations that I can work on yeah I\nI have Phoenix\nPeoria and good year ah easiest way to look at an appointment at Phoenix or a good year is to call six to three nine seven four three three three three you there's no one there obviously right now it's a business office but you can leave a message thing you want a book on employment\nOr go to my website for the phone numbers\nThat go to Iowa will fix you dot com or a pain management Arizona dot com\nI Do have a lot of great stretching charts stretching is it really important it stretching will help you get temporary relief if you already have the pains but it's really important to do to prevent yourself from getting that\nNot the muscle in the first place because when a muscle is loosened up and stretched\nThen it's more apt to perform better for you with your activities or lack of activities\nI recommend that stretching you know just I mean just about five minutes I mean doesn't have to be long just find a few stretches that are comfortable for you to do do them before you start your day\nIf you work at a desk all day if you sit in an office all day that's even better ... better reason to stretch just because\nYour body as good as ... lock it up us the muscles when you hold them in certain positions that are not just the natural neutral position\nFor long periods of time some of the fibers start getting stuck in the type position once a few fibers get stuck more fibers that are writing connect to do those stuck fibers they start getting stuck to because they can't move either\nStops blood flow you got little pockets of blood trapped in there and that is what forms the not in this and makes the entire muscle field I\nMean I don't even really have to really ...\nYou know just I mean just about five minutes I mean doesn't have to be long just find a few stretches that are comfortable for you to do do them before you start your day\nEven if you work at a desk all day if you sit in an office all day that's even better ... better reason to stretch just because\nYour body as good as ... lock it up you as the muscles when you hold them in certain positions that are not just the natural neutral position\nFor long periods of time some of the fibers start getting stuck in the type position once a few fibers get stuck more fibers that are writing connect to do those stuck fibers they start getting stuck to because they can't move either\nStops blood flow you got little pockets of blood trapped in there and that is what forms the not in this and makes the entire muscle field I\nMean I don't even really have to really massage a muscle very much I Do a little bit too warm it up so it's a little more malleable but then once I start just finding releasing the notch once I've release the Nazi entire muscle just turns the jelly\nIt's just people are just amazed at how relaxed they feel that their shoulders aren't all tense up anymore\nThe pains gone it's a it's really really a really a simple process I don't yawn glad that the government has stepped in and put it restrictions on the opioid prescribing that they're allowed to do because they're just for too long they've been prescribing\nFar too many opioids doctors have not warned about the addictive properties of a lot of these opioids\nAnd uh now they're restricted they for one can I prescribe more than five day prescription at a time without another office visit and they also are required now don't know how many of them are doing it of referring them to\nNon\nMedication based pain treatments such as massage therapy therapeutic massage acupuncture\nJust different natural ways of getting the plight pain to go away or chiropractic that's another good good option for a lot of people but a lot of people do go to chiropractic but I'll tell you if you do see a chiropractor\nYou should really consider getting a massage the same day you're going to get a chiropractic adjustment because a lot of times the reason that your spine is out of alignment is because you have tightened muscles pulling that vertebrae out of alignment\nYou go to the chiropractor snap crackle pop pop back in place but that muscles still tight it's got to pull it right back out to a very short time and then you're going to be spending more money to go back to the chiropractor you get a massage if it's not for me just tell your therapist hey I'm gonna\nI'm gonna go a get a chiropractic adjustment after this massage\nYou know work the muscles along the spy and they'll know to work their wrecked your muscles and that will you know get them loosened up so they can uh\nYour adjustment all stay a lot better\nAnd if you want to a certain stretching regiment ... check out my website that pain management Arizona dot com click on the link to go to the main site there are a bunch of free stretching charts there\nIt's got a great sketch over person in the position of the stretch the muscle is targeting his highlighted and a good description on how to do that stretch stretch safely so kind of take a look and say hey that that muscle it's showing their that looks like somewhere I get your discomfort\nAnd try that yet to find a few stretches do stretches you know I always mentioned that we can really take a lesson from the animal world you know they 'cause you know you look at your your dog or your cat so does your dog or cat wakes up from sleeping the first thing they do is stretch before they start doing dog and cat stuff and that's what we should\nYou know get them loosened up so they can uh your adjustment all stay a lot better\nAnd if you want to a certain stretching regiment ... check out my website that pain management Arizona dot com click on the link to go to the main site there are a bunch of free stretching charts there\nIt's got a great

muscle it's showing their that looks like somewhere I get you know discomfort\nAnd try that you'll find a few stretches do stretches you know I always mentioned that we couldn't really take a lesson from the animal world you know they 'cause you know you look at your your dog or your cat so does your dog or cat wakes up from sleeping the first thing they do is stretch before they start doing dog and cat stuff\nAnd that's what we should do in the mornings when we're wake up we get out of bed we should do some stretches before we start doing people's stuff because the body works so much better when it's a little stretched out little loosened up\nAnd we [noise] like I mentioned before I only charge fifty dollars per hour and that's about half the price of what those are other fast food chain of a massage places charge and you're not going to get the quality of care that you get\nThat I I can provide 'cause I did not quit learning when I finished school I kept studying\nI steady several different types of ... massaging mode allergies everything from acupuncture accurate pressure she adds suit time besides Loni Loni\nAnd looked at what the best parts of these are what really works and then I took all those best parts and studied them even further in more in depth compared them to the anatomy of the body the nervous system\nAnd it just really came up with a great system it just really works amazing and as I mentioned the new clients to get ten dollars off the first visit so the first business only forty dollars and a lot of times we can get to ... you know the entire

at the solution to the pain and I've been developing that my entire career\nAnd now I'm In business for myself so I can help more people that way\nIt was a lot of the lot of the you know there was a massage places that are popping up everywhere they\nYou know I mean I hate to be mean about it but they really don't have a clue that the owners I've never been in that kind of business they hire managers though one of the ones that worked out the manager that was telling us how to do our job used to manage your shoe store and she's like trying to\nYou know run this place and they all tried to run them like it's a spy experience which is fine if that's what you're looking for if you just want nice foo foo nice scene nice relaxation massage hot stones aroma therapy\nGo for more power to yeah that's that's great it's still really great for the body massages just really beneficial to the entire body the muscles all emphatic system\nCirculation reduces stress it's great\nBut when you have a major pain issue you need somebody that knows how to take care of it and like I tell people before if you don't want to come to me and you want to try and one of those places when you book the appointment asked them specifically\nDo you have someone who is a trigger point specialist used that term and their answer is going to be all our therapists know how to do a trigger point tell them no

in depth to try to find answers I've gotten to the point now\nThat I ask questions I cannot find the answers to you know we've got the whole world Wide Web of information and\nAnswers to questions and

is I'm not a real nationalism he is almost an actor on the stage of nationalism he doesn't really understand the strength of the nation he's he's he's only the images of the strength of the nation and so you take the twenty thousand marching toward our border\nAnd he's afraid\nWhatever few resources he gets from the country the nation\nAre going to diminish will be taken away from altogether say this is triggering and then you see who's supporting them might they might get hordes who wants to them here the entire Democrat machine\nSo he he takes his heels and it becomes even crazier and so you have to understand how these things work and what gears are in play in the minds of these people\nAnd you're lucky that you have made to explain it to you\nBecause I understand all sides of an argument I always have been able to see things in a multi dimensional fashion then that's not a spectrum thing it's cold intelligence many would say oh that's a spectrum of things that that's an inside joke for those are you on the spectrum it's not really a spectrum thing it's called a a an intelligence they can see many aspects of a thing you know\nSo if you want to comment on what's going

that you're going to be associated with Donald Trump and what the Republicans\nOr and the other hand is it making you think your hills in more saying there's nothing to do with me\nI answer the question if you don't mind\nIs this an example of one guy bringing down a party\nEven though it was impotent violence that was a threatened violence\nAnd again going back to what I said earlier in the week trust me I Know what I said I said there was a high probability of a false flag\nSchool intelligence many would say oh that's a spectrum thing that that's an inside joke for those are you on the spectrum it's not really a spectrum thing it's called a an intelligence they can see many aspects of a thing you know\nSo if you want to comment on what's going on you can on any side but my big question is how is this going to affect the midterms will it affect the election\nIf you're an independent will you stay away from the polls because of this fear that you're going to be associated with Donald Trump in what the Republicans\nOr and the other hand if you're making the hills in more saying there's nothing to do with me\nI answer the question if you don't mind\nIs this Neal example um one guy bringing down a party\nEven though was impotent violence that was a threatened violence\nAnd again going back to what I said earlier in the week trust me I Know what I said I said there was a high probability of a false flag event I did not say was certain but even having said that\nThere were elements of the story that don't add up such as the van and the stickers on the windows I don't know how that\nEveryone I Know said the same thing young guys who work for me I mean we picked up on the stickers on them and they said OK runs through your head you are smart leftist okay run the

president Donald Trump be held partially responsible for the bombs I'm going to answer no to that\nAnd it's not simply because I support Donald Trump voted for him and still support him and think he

attempted murder of people through bombs\nAnymore than Bernie Sanders inspired the man who shot up the baseball field and tried to take the life of Louisiana Congressman Steve ... and many others\nNo

intercepted\nThomas rescue and joins me now the president of CNBC protective an investigative room in a highly decorated former New York city police detective a detective rescued welcome back to the program\nLarge thanks for having me\nSo how did they get to this man so quickly what's behind that\nWay police work great police work but the un why pay day\nThe joint terrorism task force which made up of FBI agents in NYPD at New York state troopers and the Federal Bureau of investigation and what they did is they took the forensic evidence from the unexploded bombs and went through it meticulously and forensic Lee\nTo be able to come up with in a evidence which led back to seize or say Iraq as well as fingerprint on one or two of the bombs\nNow that's not always going to be possible but even want to bomb has been set up and has exploded frequently you can still get data from it catch\nYou not only do get data but you can also recreate the\nBomb so one of the things I mean we can we can take it from the Ramsey Yusef a World Trade center bombing in Nineteen Ninety three aware they exploded a car and the\nNYPD and the FBI were able to recreate that car to the point where they came up with a number for the car and the type of explosives and put it together to be able to track it back to Ramzi Yousef to be able to arrest him and satisfactorily convicted where he's still serving time in federal prison\nLet me ask you this in addition to all the physical evidence like fingerprints on DNA would say is our say acts a name naturally have been to some extent on a list anyway because he had prior terrorism on his record\nData from it catch\nYou not only do get data but you can also recreate the\nBomb so one of the things I mean we can we can take it from the

the car and the type of explosives and put it together to be able to track it back to Ramzi Yousef to be able to arrest him and satisfactorily convict him where he still serving time in federal prison\nNow let me ask you this in addition to all the physical evidence like fingerprints and DNA\nWould seize are say acts a name naturally have been to some extent on a list anyway because he had prior terrorism on his record he had ties to both Florida and New York\nAnd would you work at the ... and simultaneously by saying who are the best suspects that we already know may be on in the mix\nBut we don't know if they came to that of eventually they probably would have being that he was in that area the fact that as you properly allude to he had the\nPrior threats of bombings and the fact that uh he was driving around the van that would have probably eventually led to someone making the call if they didn't already\nAt what point do you I don't view it'd be a monumental task I Would imagine but at what point do we need to start screening male or at least packages the same way that people get screened before they go on an airplane where where's that are ridiculous suggestion or physically impossible\nWell I don't know about the physical impossibility of doing it I think it's something that's come out of this case and I'm surprised that they don't do it more often I Know FedEx and UPS de do some kind of screening and to try and determine what they're shipping\nBut the U.S postal service handling billions of pieces of mail a year\nIt may be much more of a difficult task but you would think that if you're going to implement that type of procedure you would start so with packages and work your way back to potentially envelopes and or anthrax\nDetective risk and that's exactly what I'm thinking of and I know that\nI fly I don't know a dozen times a year most of it for work but I Know that when I'm walking through the line and my my years being scanned that they're looking at a screen and the to some extent that thing is color coded it makes me think that\nMay be an automated system could at least ... some of the more obvious ones because I you know I Know that some of this is a closely held piece of information\nBut I Know just by looking at the system that things show up differently on that screen depending on what kind of material they're looking at are they looking at fabric or they're looking at metal are they looking at the inside of a laptop and what does a legitimate laptop battery look like and what does the laptop battery look like\nAnd what does a piece of plastic pipe look like if it's filled with some kind of powder I mean it could be ... or it could be full of explosives and I would imagine in this day and age ah we've got such good technological tools\nThat you'd think you might be able to scan many thousands of packages and just have the computer said to say when you see one that ... that fits a certain set of criteria pick that one side and then we'll take a closer look at it and then you might be able to do these packages\nIs an excellent point and I'm surprised we don't do it already what came out of this case is that we don't do it to that proportion\nLook at an airport when you when I go through the screener and no matter what Loni Iran it goes there something suspicious shows up in that package which calls for secondary screening it kicks it out of the machine to ...\nGentlemen laptop battery look like and what does the laptop battery look like and what does a piece of plastic pipe look like if it's filled with some kind of powder I mean it could be ... or it could be full of explosives and I would imagine in this day and age uh we've got such good technological tools\nThat you'd think you might be able to scan many thousands of packages and just have the computer said to say when you see one that ... that fits a certain set of criteria kick that one side and then we'll take a closer look at it and then you might be able to do these packages\nIs an excellent point and I'm surprised we don't do it already what came out of this case is that we don't do it to that proportion look at an airport when you when I go through the screener\nAnd no matter what line Iran it goes there if something suspicious shows up in that package which calls for secondary screening it kicks it out of the machine kicks it out of the conveyor belt to a second conveyor belt I don't know why we couldn't look to do that in the U.S postal service\nSend you wouldn't necessarily have to do with the human beings sitting there slowly examining each one if you know that a computer never gets tired you know if his scanning looking for particular characteristics\nIt never gets tired and never has an off they had never had the day when you didn't get your second cup of coffee and the computers should and now I'm not saying the machines are everything but if you need to scan hundreds of thousands of baggage is I don't know how you could do it unless you had an army of people saying they're looking at screens all day\nWhere you wouldn't do it we don't do it at the airport where we do is we have a screener\nWho is alerted by a computer screen that there's something that calls for secondary screening at that\nWith this package and that's what kicks it out so if you're a package was delayed by or if my package was delayed by a day or so I wouldn't mind if it needs a secondary screening and therefore was put into separate line and had to then be done by a human or even the second machine to us\nTo a third point where a human then looks at it because I think that the safety of our postal employees and the people who are delivering the mail and people where it's going into a male Roman certain buildings around this country you know the safety of our people\nIn our citizens are paramount to law enforcement as well as everyone else in this country\nNicely said now tell me this one else have we missed and what else have we learned about this one that we ought to be doing differently if anything\nWell I I think what we learned is how well law enforcement can come upon\nSomeone who is looking to do us harm and how quickly law enforcement agencies around this country this happened to be kudos the NYPD the FBI and the joy terrorists task force and the postal inspectors but you know it it shows what law enforcement\nAround this country and what cops do every single day and every single jurisdiction to keep our people safe and how quickly they'll find you if you plan to do an act of terrorism in this country and threatened the people of any city or any jurisdiction the police will get you\nThey will arrest you and you will spend the rest of your life in jail\nSay Iraq is now looking at fifty eight years with just the five charges they charged him with today I think they'll add additional charges as other things are found it'll be a life sentence either way even fifty eight years it's fifty six years is a life sentence for him and he deserves every single day of it if not the death penalty\nI absolutely agree one last thing in about forty seconds and that is do you believe based on what we know and I know you're not you know in that position the crime lab is do you think he intended for any of these to go on for nearly to have devices that we're real old enough to really terrorize people\nAsked director race said today the director of the FBI these were functional devices he didn't say\nAnd threatened the people of any city or any jurisdiction police will get you\nThey will arrest you and you will spend the rest of your life in jail\nSay is now looking at fifty eight years with just the chargers they charged with today I think they'll add additional charges is other things are failed it'll be a life sentence either way even fifty eight years it's fifty six years as a life sentence for him and he deserves every single day of it is not the death penalty\nI absolutely agree one last thing in about forty seconds and that is do you believe based on what we know when I Know you're not you know in that position the crime lab is do you think he intended for any of that used to go on for nearly have devices that we're real old enough to really terrorize people\nAsked director race said today the director of the FBI or functional devices he didn't say if they were capable of going out but they ... they were put together in a way that they could have gone off and potentially hurt somebody\nThat has never been the way that conservatives have behaved so you're asking for something that goes way outside\nOf our usual behavior I mean most of the Tea Party a protest ones that I went to and ones that I saw in other cities and indeed see on television\nThey were incredibly civilized event whereas you you look at the average left wing event a good example January of twenty Seventeen after Donald Trump's inauguration\nThe crazy women's march ... you know the fact is\nThere's nothing wrong with women saying we want to be treated equally an equitable okay it's already in the law was would you like we'd like to burn some limousines we'd like to stage a protest in which people have their safety threatened and that causes a lot of trouble and gets us on TV I think that's what's crazy\nAlthough as I say I don't want to mention was Madonna telling telling us chilling support Trump and that's not black oh\nIs often fantasize dreamed of blowing up the White House that's what McDonald's said and that is wacko is well and yet you know that if\nA Republican had said this very same words in the very same tone of voice CNN would be running it in a video loop but if Madonna says it they say look what a strong powerful feminist she there's adult there is a really strong double standard\nAnd done I I Love journalism I'd been in a long time and I love the craft I was in it as a reporter without my opinion uh being being shown in my stories and as a talk show host I give my opinions every day\nI'm proud of journalism but I'm not proud of what journalism has become because we have people who are supposed to be reporters and keep their opinions out who are inserting their opinions I worked my tail off and\nShe is often fantasize dreamed of blowing up the White House that's when Madonna said and that is wacko as well and yet you know that if\nA Republican had said this very same words in the very same tone of voice CNN would be running it in a video loop but if Madonna says it they say look what a strong powerful feminist she there's adult there is a really strong double standard\nAnd done I I Love journalism I'd been in a long time and I love the crap I was in it as a reporter without my opinion uh being being shown in my stories and as a talk show host I give my opinions every day\nI'm proud of journalism but I'm not proud of what journalism has become\nBecause we have people who are supposed to be reporters and keep their opinions out who are inserting their opinions I worked my tail off and the proof that I think I kept my opinions out of my stories is that when I went\nFrom being a reporter on television or radio to being a talk show host there were folks I'd run into both strangers and people I knew who say you're a conservative and I said yeah\nI'm a conservative ... well I never knew that\nAnd I said what you think I was a life you worked on television I thought you were a liberal I said well clearly I kept my opinion out of my reporting which is what reporters are supposed to do\nThe other thing that's dangerous to the entire profession\nIs if you tell people when we cover stories were going to cover them in a double standard that in other words if one group of people says something or does something we're going to tell this kind of story but if somebody else from the other side does precisely the same thing or something so similar there is nearly identical\nWe're going to treat the story entirely differently\nI mean constantly I look up at these two screens in my studio one was Fox on one with CNN on a big big screen TVs\nAnd I and I look at them and I see them saying with no proof Donald Trump says X or y or Z and I thought during the entire eight years of a bomb uh I never once saw them say\nWith no proof whatsoever Brock Obama today claimed to blah blah blah and I thought the ... there ... there were plenty of times I mean when when when one broad Obama was asked do you know that the IRS has been going out and denying as\nConservative groups free speech rights by denying their applications for tax free status head no he said oh the first I knew about it was one I saw it on the news and I thought\nThat at a bold faced lie you can't\nMake as you can't tell us on one hand you're a Harvard educated lawyer and your ... according to your fans one of the smartest guys on the planet\nAnd then turn around and say no I was completely clueless\nAs ...

agencies whose entire job is to gather every important piece of data in the world even stuff\nThat that secret and then to boil it down to just what the president needs to know and say Mr President we are going to tell you what's going on in Turkey or what's going on in Iran ... we're going to tell you what's going on in Iowa and they boil it all down and they feed it to him\nAnd say this is what you need to know how could a guy who's so well informed\nClaim to be so ignorant of what was going on in the only answer is\nHe was lying and yet I never saw CNN or MSNBC\nOr any of the rest of the joker is the New York times say the president claimed without any sense of credibility\nThat he had no idea what was going on in the D. O. J. during fast and furious or the IRS during a the the cheating on conservative groups he had no idea that the EPA was out\nImportant piece of data in the world even stuff\nThat that secret and then to boil it down to just what the president needs to know and say Mr President we are going to tell you what's going on in Turkey or what's going on in Iran we are going to tell you what's going on in Iowa and they boil it all down and they feed it to him\nAnd say this is what you need to know how could a guy who's so well informed\nClaim to be so ignorant of what was going on in the only answer is\nHe was lying and yet I never saw CNN or MSNBC\nOr near the rest of those ... or the New York times say the president claimed without in any sense of credibility\nThat he had no idea what was going on to the D.

critical of the media as Donald Trump has been\nCritical of democratic politicians and critical of a lot of Republican politicians as well I might remind you that one of the unique\nThings about Donald Trump is it while you didn't hear Broncos Obama criticized people from his own party very much at all\nIn fact I Can't think of a very good example where ... Obama or Bill Clinton a or Jimmy Carter or any of the other Democrats who have served as president of the United states chose to criticize their own party\nBut I Do see them you know criticized the

your phone calls and emails on this First Amendment friday night but I also want to talk to my friend Dr Henry Miller and you know him as a senior fellow at the Pacific research Institute published in a lot of places both scholarly journals that are way beyond my ability to read and the popular press as well Dr Miller welcome back\nGood to be with you it was\nSo we've got a lot of other threats in this world obviously today we've been spending a lot of time talking about the bomber and that sort of thing and I wanted to grab you on a couple of those things at the end of this interview but would you mind talking about the fact that we see continued that bridge to try to ban plastic here and banned plastic there\nAnd the fact is I thought plastics has actually been one of the things we had done that actually made our lives we take it for granted but it's made our lives a whole lot safer from a lot of the threats of human beings have faced literally for thousands of years and plastic as the way we've escape from some of those threats\nOh absolutely and in fact uh as I wrote this article about it go fundamentalists attacks on plastics or I thought back to the Nineteen sixty seven film the graduate or and you may remember that\nUh Dustin Hoffman plays the title role and she said his graduation party and and the guy comes up to him and says a ban I have one word for you\n... and a and a half century since then plastics have really revolutionized are so many industries\nUh and uh you know when I was training and and medicine we had just converted from glass bottles for intravenous solutions and blood to plastic bottles and it was such a remarkable improvement they store better if they keep better they're safer\nBecause inevitably glass bottles which would be dropped a and the ... the glass on the floor and you would you would never get up and people would get caught and\nWith a and you may remember that uh Dustin Hoffman plays the title role and he said his graduation party and I'm a guy comes up to him and says a fan I have one word for you\nTime ribs and as a and a half century since then plastics have really revolutionized are so many industries\nAre and uh you know when I was training and and medicine we had just converted from glass bottles for intravenous solutions and blood to plastic bottles and it was such a remarkable improvement they store better they keep better they're safer\nBecause inevitably glass bottles which would be dropped a and the ... the glass on the floor and you would you would never get up and people would get caught and and so on a but\nMedical devices or electronics all sorts of things\nUh plastics had been really a revolution and yet the activists continue to attack it a Earth Day in April of this year was a devoted to ending plastic pollution quote unquote and um we continue to have a\nA tax on various plaster size or things that make plastics pliable and more convenient or like this ... a BPA um and the attacks just go on and on and on a a base with or without much basis um and without\nThinking about it carefully and considering the science\nWell and I thought about that too because I Know a lot of people say well you know there's food safety but I buy my food in tin cans when a lot of people may not appreciate is those so called tin cans with ... which had very little pin in them\nAre actually lined with as you said BPA and other kinds of things that make\nA tin can a whole lot more safe for containing any kind of food you buy the grocery store and and and I and the plastics you know dark I think about the plastics where products you know including a lot of\nFood products are package sometimes hermetically sealed and you know the air and taken out or some other kind of gas put in so that so that everything last longer and or is or is better and better protected against the kind of common contamination they could literally take your life or a few decades ago\nYou're you're absolutely right and you you bring up a lot of a broader point which is\nThat you have to you have to do it the risk analysis folks called comparative risk assessment you have to ask if you if you eliminate a product day what are you substitute for what are you left with a and so we're seeing that in California because there's a\nA a state senator who keeps introducing bills to ban Styrofoam containers from restaurants for takeout and for a for\nHot beverages or cold averages and uh it seems popular because we see a Styrofoam trash around but the alternative of course his paper or which is\nI'm more a consumptive of oil and electricity interestingly um\nBy the way I Want people to take note of that and the fact that they say well this or do you START I remember the McDonald's Styrofoam clam shells they'd put hamburgers and because it both inflated and kept the juice worried belong\nAnd they said well you have to get rid of these because they don't degrading the landfill and when I went on research in a long time ago I had people say well we're going to replace them with plastic coded paper oh how does that'd be great and they said well it doesn't quite last as long in the landfill ... maybe the Styrofoam would degrade over a you know hundreds of years\nHot beverages or cold temperatures and uh it seems popular because we see a Styrofoam trash around but the alternative of course is paper which is\nI'm more a consumptive of oil and electricity interestingly um\nBy the way I Want people to take note of that and the fact that they say well this or do you START I remember the McDonald's Styrofoam clam shells they'd put hamburgers and because it both inflated and kept the juice worried belong\nAnd they said well you have to get rid of these because they don't degrading the landfill and when I went out and research in a long time ago\nI had people say well we're going to replace them with plastic coded paper oh how does that'd be great and they said well it doesn't quite last as long in the landfill it it may be the Styrofoam would degrade over a you know hundreds of years and the paper will degrade over fewer hundreds of years am I right about those numbers are you are my aunt or\nDo you are absolutely right that if the other thing is that the police the Iranian uh generates less waste water and also occupies less space and landfill\nAnd the other thing is that we have we now have bacteria that will degrade a Styrofoam and and other plastics and the landfill so you know that this that these objections these attempts to band things are just not well founded and well thought out\nSo which is typical of what we say about the anti corporate anti technology a pickle fundamentalist\nHey I Want to ask you about something else 'cause about about an hour ago I was talking to a guest a who's a former police detective we were talking about the bomber you know the bombs that went through the males and he said well what he ... he thought it was interesting that we found out he was he was a ... a retired top investigator for New York city's police department\nAnd he said we found out the postal service has things like this going through it and we don't even know it and I thought and we're always hearing about other kinds of contraband whether it's illegal drugs from Asia\nOr we're seeing a stuff come through that it's that marijuana good ship that way and if states haven't decided to legalize it it shouldn't be ship\nAnd I asked him we had this technology we see at the airport and I you know while I don't know all the particulars of it I Know that when they watch your bag with computers and cell phones and this and batteries and all that goes through\nThey know what color the screen is supposed to be and they know what colors indicate it may be some kind of contraband whether it's a fluid liquid or possibly explosive\nYou know I don't know what color explosive comes up as because I Would imagine I haven't been through the TSA line when somebody whose putting explosives through but my understanding is the color coding helps them spot those things pull him aside and do some more examination I said if you wanted to scan hundreds of thousands of uh packages the postal service carried\nCould we do that and could we say to a computer\nWhen a certain kind of material or what appears to be that kind of material comes through you know as we X ray could we X ray you know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that they may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicks set aside\nAnd and let somebody else take a closer look at it that's all the technology to ditch within our grasp isn't it\nIt it it is and with artificial intelligence or the system can actually learn what it needs to reject and ... in red flag and pass all are in fact it's my understanding that\nChecked baggage is a analyze that way as well as the the the package that you put the put on a conveyor belt yourself\nSo we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like they're strangers doing their job they do now but they're losing first class mail but why don't we make sure that this\nX ray could we X ray you know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that they may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicks set aside\nAnd and let somebody else take a closer look at it that's all the technology to ditch within our grasp isn't it\nIt it it is and with artificial intelligence or the system can actually learn what it needs to reject and ... in red flag and pass all are in fact it's my understanding that\nChecked baggage is a analyze that way as well as the the package that you put put on a conveyor belt yourself\nSo we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like they're strangers doing the job they do now but they're losing first class mail but why don't we make sure that the stuff that's going through the post office gets scanned by that same kind of thing I think the public would be all for it\nYeah I think we could certainly do that for packages or you know flat flat letters a could probably sail through and and maybe do it just for packages that's a very good idea or as\nWell I just it just struck me that if that's within our grasp but I'm the same guy who wants to see a chicken irradiated before it gets into the supermarket so we can kill all the salmonella or the other bacteria that he'd call I'd that's on the exterior of it is it isn't a cure all\nPeople freak out and and and unfortunately with bears a you know that panic attack

try to keep him confined up there\nWhen we try to at least get them elected to office and then they can do crazy things like you know go ... on a board member from a jails to try to get you know our

you might have done the work on his computer but a\nPrinter had to create those and the FBI I'm sure knows who who uh printed them and when if they were created you know in the last two weeks\nIt's

God Bless Trump ... Trump Trump forever you know it's all part of it for the next twelve days but I think it's going to have the reverse effect the van and so obviously a bogus part of a\n... well actually it is nobody I Know buys that did this whole thing is real and now this is MORNING EDITION of box in New York on the road map bragging Alex Jones or an aerospace engineer on the bombings what do you think about not just the the fake bombing and the fact bombs but now that\nWell the thing I wanted to point out about the the state bombs being a\nEvent orchestrated for maximum\nPolitical effect that it took him over three days to to send it to believe declared these things I mean on first glance Alex any competent intelligence agent or\nA bomb experts would say no no way I mean the the L E do you think that the dollar store elite the device with a one point five ... watch battery doesn't have the kind of uh\nYeah it's all part of it for the next ... days but I think it's going to have the reverse effect the van and so obviously a bogus part of a\n... well actually it is nobody I Know buys that did this whole thing's Rio and now this is MORNING EDITION of box in New York only or with Matt reckon Alex Jones or an aerospace engineer on the bombings what do you think about not just the the fake bombing and the fact bombs but now the\nWill of the bail on a to point out about the the state bombs being a\nPolitical event orchestrated for maximum\nPolitical fact is that it took him over three days to to send it to believe declared these things I mean first glance Alex any competent at intelligence agent or a or\nA bomb experts would say no no way I mean they ... do you think that the dollar store elite the device with a one point five ... watch battery doesn't have the kind of\nA outputs or even a triggers or gait flooded cave in to do it so the fact that I I have a difficult time accepting that it took them three days\nA to tell us this I mean I certainly hope not honest with me they are really dumb or or they deliberately how this uh information from maximum political fact which latte or I think is definitely the case I forgive the Don lemon and the ... puts his crimes to to\nMilk it which is what they've been doing these last three days [noise] uh it said sure it's a cheesy October surprise and if this is the best they got I mean uh it's pretty pretty bad [laughter] so I\nKnow I agree it's a really cheesy October surprise and that's why I'm really concerned that this is a distraction from something bigger ... like you said I Want to get boxers tank first an attack on that care of and that just like\nJames Woods and you and I predicted they wouldn't be on but they got trucks bringing them up right on time a few days before and claim some militia right winger shoots these phones what do you think box\nWell I'll tell you what I I Do think that um that\nObviously it's staged that one too and uh it's the ... gene sharp ... technique of sort of roping your target\nBeing Trump into and untenable media position by having like pregnant women and children up front and then what the the the guards have to sort of like either physically restrain them or shoot them or something with a rubber bullets or something so this is a way to sort of\nLike a ... an attempt not it's not going to be a successful but sort of rope Trump and and this is the ...\nAnd that's why they share their ... borders no borders no wall know usa at all and the good news huge\nLou Dobbs James was just not to sound shows now it's Rush Limbaugh all saying this is a false flag this is John it's fake everyone agrees I think that's the real moment we cross steer botch it now and I like to say I'm becoming on obsolete in a way and that's why they sent all the news the Republican Party has now been Alex Jones or size\nWell no you just met reality it's not me people now have in common sense it shaped British saying now box right points thank you Matt comments on

Trump analysis shows you're going to bomb innocent ... with no evidence and it pops up right on time I mean it's not exactly\nExactly it's not hard and and but the thing is that you've got lots of people out there that actually believe in television is that's all they know they've been raised on television or anything and everything that they've ever known as been on television like in the movie network right I mean you\nKnow the thing we tell them what to say exactly\nExactly exactly and and then they eat it up and when they censoring you and you can't ... you can't counterpoint to anything and then people are we going to keep the fake\nNews like here in Canada where all our news agencies ... all the fake news from the United states and re packages\nAnd sells it to us I mean they don't even mention about the care of them going on I don't even mention about uh the connection with add on to show he and his I don't know if this was a brother or a cousin and then you have to

is just too obvious\nAnd there's some weird reason it reminded me of Las Vegas I don't know why but it just had that weird feel that\nAnd when they censoring you and you can't you can't counterpoint to anything and then people are we going to take a big news like here in Canada all around you can eat ... all the fake news from the United states and re packages\nAnd sells it to us I mean they don't even mention about the caravan going on I don't even mention about the collection would add on to show he and and I don't know if it's a brother or a cousin and then you have to show you got killed who had links to ice right it just goes on and on and on I mean\nYou see this things lifted the ban it you know when when I saw that Dan I'm like wait a second that that that is just too obvious\nAnd for some reason it reminded me of Las Vegas\nI don't know why but it just had that weird feel that it was just Las Vegas the thing about it\nOh I Know since we didn't buy Los Vegas they shut that down real quick segment called you wrap points that you\nGo ahead oh he's gone Charlotte you know two point man I Want to come back and just heavy briefing they'll let you go yeah but\nWhat the negative is though because I agree with the shows they admit when the exit polls and and people that have been pulled that are record numbers Republicans\nTurning out they're turning out in the mid term why it is a general election every four years this is every to show hey what might they pulled and ... and the next year and a half days stop dish and B how could they grab victory from the jaws of defeat and then\nWhat do they do when they lose big time which all the numbers show because this is not a regular lecture the political once in a three generation political realignment just what's happening right now\nWhere are you going to last ... sorry go ahead\nYeah the last caller was saying it so it's like a Hollywood so but you know what people are hip to that to look at the movies shooter was based on point of impact the whole idea of patties and black and false flags it's mainstream now you know people when they see that van they laugh\nSo I don't think it's going to have the effect they're still living in the old days when they could manipulate us we now are hip to false wax we're we're we notice\nAnd they couldn't help but make it all be perfectly rafting clean and popping clearly in a production instead of like an old sticker or something 'cause that would take something oh that would take some work it's easy to get a new van and plaster all this on it it's

earlier in the week trust me I Know what I said I said there was a high probability of a false flag event I did not say was certain but even having said that\nThere were elements of the story that

know for it and say look we're going to offer more protection for all of these political you know a democratic followers and things like that because I think about it is is that if he keeps on the tweeting\nAnd the longer that this airplane on the selection of what we're trying to discover here about the alleged bomber\nWe keep the media doesn't regulate their coverage on the discovery of this farmer\nIt could actually end up helping Trump as long as he keeps his nose clean because my concern is this caravan we're going to have a crescendo right now and it's kind of climax just\nHours before the election and they're going to show all of the national guard and they're going to turn it on trial and the whole thing is just going to create this medium ... what's the narrative is look at this guy Trump look what he's doing look at the on humanitarian effort that he's\nA well that's why they have to be stopped by the Mexican military in Mexico and and not be allowed within hundreds

um you asked your two hundred times less stems cells and what you started with now think about this though\nYou have to have to stem cells to grow new tissue so you've never had a tissue grown or your growing in size a brain neurology intestines all you have to have the same cells to develop all that stuff so of course that makes sense why we have so many more during that time but what happens over time if they start to they recycle only so many times and then they just stop\nSo we don't he owes vast when they get older and so there was a great example and I went to a seminar about a month ago and um\nUtah and it was a new procedure for stem cells and bone spurs and how to get rid of those um and they said about a baby that rolls down a set of stairs pick it up they laugh it off okay maybe a crowd a little bit but they laugh it off and they got a new toy and they go and they do something else right and no big deal\nI'm Sorry but if I rolled down his that as as you better\nDown nine one one when we're done [laughter] probably be hurting the ice packs I Want to make sure everything's working and you know we don't bounce\nDown and think about an eighty year old you know when when they fall or hurt themselves you know um they just don't respond as well the immune system starts to get shut down says don't forget stem cells also go after the immune system in the immune system is designed as hum is operated by the nervous system\nSo when you have stem cells um ... and you have a lot of them you end up you end up doing much better\nYou end up repairing better [noise] and so stem cells are necessary to rebuild and regenerate issue\nThey get up they laugh it off okay maybe a crowd a little bit but they laugh it off and they'd rather new toy and they go and they do something else right and no big deal I'm Sorry but if I roll down a set of stairs you better\nDown nine one one when we're done [laughter] I'm I'm probably be hurting the ice packs I Want to make sure everything's working and you know we don't bounce back of\nSouth and think about an eighty year old you know when when they fall or hurt themselves you know um they just don't respond as well the immune system starts to get shut down for don't forget that was also go after the immune system in the immune system is designed is um is operated by the nervous system\nSo when you have stem cells um ... and you have a lot of them you end up you end up doing much better\nYou end up repairing better [noise] and so stem cells are necessary to rebuild and regenerate issue this has been around for decades folks it might be a new to you because you know we're just getting it up to the public like on this radio station\nBut it's been around for decades look back in Nineteen oh eight there was a theory that there was a cell that was a master cells that was developing us and then in ... and look at the history on the Internet there's accustomed cool stuff I'm In Nineteen sixty three they were actually starting to use the stem cells and recognizing this potential and it's a power\nAnd then in Nineteen sixty eight they actually did their vote first bone marrow transplant which is worst themselves actually are\nUm and then in Nineteen Ninety eight to George Bush you know a a minister Asian went ahead and stocks\nThe study is themselves but let's clear this up there is a mess out there the myth is that stem cells only come from fetuses and from embryos of abortions that it's not true\nThey actually have stem cells in the ad in the Arctic sack\nWith which you and I grew up in okay for nine months and then it's in the cord and so you have a high concentration of stem cells in these areas these are legal in the United states\nI'm back in Nineteen Ninety eight there was some bad things that were happening unfortunately people were taking advantage of money got involved I think what's happened is often and they had to kind of eradicate that they are doing it in other parts of the world\nYou know for some things that you know we're not doing here because of these ethical laws um but you know right now the stem cells that are available to you if you're having pain in your joints\nUm don't wait I've got my own small testimony with a robocop neon today you know I'm I'll share that and just a minute but you know I Want you also really understand that this might not this might be a new to you but it's not new to science\nAnd so when you come into the clinical you come to my seminar on Tuesday night at six thirty\nI'm I'm going to teach you about these things I'm going to actually sit down I'm going to make sure that you are educated you make an informed choice ah with all the knowledge that you have an or take at least that next step together more knowledge look this is your body\nI'm Jennifer what kind of car are you today remember we talked about that\nYes well right now might that I did I not jaguar jaguar okay\nSo so right about ... titles I Love that [laughter] I'm only half of that alone is not on a cell jaguar so we're looking at a convertible\nOf course so ... so what do you drive at the top down I've choir okay um and All right Jamie return

Thirteen Years and it never had issues with it so I kinda liked that idea\nWell when did you guys let me know get a caller and solve we'll see if we can fix it okay [laughter] so I ...\nAt least that next step together more knowledge look this is your body I'm Jennifer what kind of car are you today remember we talked about that\nYes well right now I I did I not jaguar jaguar okay so\nSo writes about your titles I Love that [laughter] I'm only half of that alone not on a cell jaguar so we're looking at a convertible\nCar so that ... you drive at the top down I've choir okay um and All right Jamie return what kind of car you know the it's called different that your body what is your car what are you driving to the rest of your life\nYou know what I'm trying to get the RV hey beautiful I I\nMy theory for Thirteen Years and it never had issues with it so I kinda liked that idea\nWell when I was let me know get a caller and solve we'll see if we can fix it okay [laughter] so I you know I'm a ...\nD convertible spider I Love that right and I'm thinking what is your C. R. V. I just might drop it down and put some ... some twenty chews on it you know but maybe not maybe that's what you like driving so whenever you are\nAsked yourself right now what are you\nSome people like to be a sea RV some people like to be a tank or the front line but on the football field right some people are like ... like ... or their motorcycles ... the ... is what I was thinking whatever it is you are this is the only vehicle you're going to get for lice\nDon't take it for granted look your body's going to talk to you\nWe called body language it's not crossing the arms are opening up its not leaning forward into somebody to drive a point or set back to accept some knowledge right I don't know what position you're in right now hopefully you're sitting back in Seventy knowledge but you know his body language so when your body starts talking to you you do need to listen\nSo I'm gonna tell my story now because I didn't listen as well as I should have I'm going to tell them myself\nAnd six years ago I was right in the tendency mountains and\nI had a bicycle crash I was by myself and it was a ten mile ride I was about a two to four miles and and I didn't break anything everything was working right now I'm a doctor I can evaluate this right with nobody around and see if I should walk out or ride out I could write out it was no big deal\nBut I had a big old he was home or a big bruise on my inside of my side and you know and I got home after riding the next six to eight miles out I was black and blue all the way from my my uh or my leg attached to my body all the way down to my calf I'm like oh that's not good that was really dumb\nBut for the last six years I just had some nuts and my legs are trying to do some ultrasound insects and they are just must be scar tissue no big deal well apparently there was more damaging their because about two months ago my knee started kind of acting up and I've never damage my knees in my life\nI was a wrestler was a runner all that kind of stuff never and then about three weeks ago I could hardly get up and down stairs\nSo I wouldn't have him or I'd done over a valley radiologist an amazing group of people um they're very high and so if you have a choice they and smile I Love them but I went over there um and I found out that I had torn three muscles on the inside of my leg\nAnd that the inside of them I mean that's just on my knee was actually starting to fray we're starting to shreds\nAnd I'm like okay you know I Need to see the family out of tissue and Dr Miller phenomenal phenomenal injection is his mind that they have the medical doctor for the last two years we work together\nI had him and Jack ... and I've got a robocop me a new I mean I just got a knee brace on an ... races he's nine to unload the inside that need so we're not working harder in order to try to rebuild under duress and stress while I'm Still helping\nPeople in the clinic so I started with body language so my body was telling me something for six years but because it wasn't really detrimental I could still function and run and hike and stuff like that and ride bikes weightless\nAnd I found out that I have two and three muscles on the inside of my life and that the inside of my ... on my knee was actually starting to free it was starting to shreds\nAnd I'm like okay you know I Need to see the survey on the other issue in Dr Miller phenomenal phenomenal injection us he's my ... medical doctor for the last two years we've worked together\nI had him inject and I've got to robocop me a new I mean I just got a knee brace on ... races designed to unload the inside that need so we're not working harder in order to try to rebuild under duress and stress while I'm Still helping people\nIn the clinic so I started with body language\nSo my body was telling me something for six years but because it wasn't really detrimental I could still function and run and hike and stuff like that and ride bikes waitlist I just didn't think there was much there I didn't and I'm a doctor and I and I should've I should've done something and I didn't\nSo folks if you're not a doctor I don't think you know more either I thought I did but if you have an injury and your past and it's just even a slight something or other that means there's at least fifty percent dysfunction occurring there because you don't get a symptom until that happens\nSo don't wake call the clinic called six zero to nine nine to two six five six six to nine nine two to six five six only for healthy habits am I doing complimentary councils that rule changed last week\nOkay so make sure you mentioned that you heard me on healthy habits Jamie Jennifer a dance tunes chair any of the poison here told you to come see me or you heard me on the radio or just mentioned the name and it will be complementary outside of that there is a small city in order to be able to do the consultation\nAnd an examination on that area to tell you what's next where I'm going to send you around going to help you and I'm looking forward to seeing you in the Clinton\nSo just to wrap this up for everyone listening is what you're saying is do not ignore it it's not going to go away when a pain happens um see somebody right away about it I mean because you can't just think oh it'll go away right\nNow without damage [laughter] right exactly yeah I mean I I mean you'll\nJust get more damage and more damage than when you start seeing the signs listeners you know how Dr frost again mentioned healthy habit it's going to be free what do you have to lose you know\nSo yeah people say what do I have to pay that attention [laughter] I don't really love those are going to cost you a little bit of time yes that's it but\nYou know there there's no money that has to come out of your pocket to find out if it's the right solution for you but look if you're already on drugs if you're already on opiates if you're trying to suppress you know the pain that's coming in I'm pleased with at least a decrease that or or get your life back\nUm you know we're helping the military when I was when I was in the home show over Westworld this weekend was amazing\nThe military personnel that were coming in and I'm like guys I Know you were pushed for Twenty years but now it's time to fix you or maybe it was only four years so\nLet's world this weekend was amazing the military personnel that were coming in yeah like I Know you were pushed for Twenty years but now it's time to fix you or maybe it was only four years so\nUm I Would have definitely done clinical exam on your which I'm actually if you don't mind before we leave here today I Want to I Would like to check your shoulder out if I'm not sure okay and let's just validate now what I heard immediately was body language mhm\nNah I worked in a nursing home ... I was the head orderly\nI got to roll patience and change sheets invade them I understand what all that means yeah and that's hard hard work and it takes a special person to do that\nAnd that's why I don't do it anymore [laughter] I went into a different fields because I just couldn't do that but you know I understand the stress in the strain or what ended up happening was your body it didn't just whisper to you I'm assuming it didn't have a whisper ahead of time right now but if you needed was like the childhood that a little pinprick writes screen [noise]\nAnd yeah I had to listen to me 'cause this is not good that's right and the end result you were telling me earlier if I remember I was just general bones burner yes okay um and did you hear anything that you tear a labor them which is that cartridge around the edges of joint\nYou know so when they did the X ray and set the for the surgery they said they thought there was a hair yeah ... when they went in there and they said they didn't see its hair okay with mainly the bone spurs that was probably causing the pain that makes sense you know\nPopping is not necessarily a bone spur so I ran the probability there's other things going on we're not going to solve on the radio today but\nI'm living in a well number one is it sounds like you're probably we're doing everything right and how to compromise issue prior to maybe if you played sports that you went through college are you grew up as a kid and had Fifteen hundred spinal traumas and shoulder troubled by the time you were Thirteen to compromise and then it finally just if finally just reached out to you and said hey you need to pay attention to me\nThe fact that you went through everything that you did\nAnd still couldn't figure it out those are the kinds of patients that I actually like to have come into my clinic because oftentimes we can help people that have been through that so if it's a bone spur we do unfortunately have to tell people that there's a possibility you might have to have you know or just stop at surgery to remove that\nAnd how do we just stem cells after that in order to regenerate and rebuild that just should because people get an amazing results\nAfter they cleaned up so I Do recommend surgery at times but it is the last result the last thing I Want to do is that oh no you're going to be fine do you know and the other issue on you\nKnow kind of growth factors and and the themselves on you and knowing that there's a bones brother probably aggravating and sharing tissue at the same time because from what I can see in all the studies that I have seen and done over the last two years I've only seen one person would appear that the\nAnd then it finally just do it finally just reached out to you and said hey you need to pay attention to me the fact that you went through everything that you did\nAnd still couldn't figure it out those are the kinds of patients so I actually like to have come into my clinic because oftentimes we can help people that have been through that so if it's a bone spur we do unfortunately have to tell people that there's a possibility you might have to have you know or just GOP surgery to remove that\nAn average of stem cells after that in order to regenerate and rebuild that issue because people get are are amazing results\nAfter they cleaned up so I Do recommend surgery at times but it is the last result the last thing I Want to do is that oh no you're going to be fine do you know and the other issue on you\nKnow kind of growth factors and and the themselves on you\nAnd knowing that there's a bones brother probably aggravating and sharing tissue at the same time because from what I can see in all the studies that I have seen and done over the last two years I've only seen one person would appear that the bone spur actually started to go away I'm outside of that there's no documentation but I Know that valid as that but what they talk about on another part of the program\nHow bone spurs are now starting to\nDissolve or start to go way mhm um and it's with nutrition and I would like to talk about that and and you can tell them if you have that in the store here as well but you know um\nBut I Would do it yeah it's just a simple injection we would find out if there were torn muscles in which ones they were torn after doing orthopedic neurological exam\nUm being a sideline Dr semi pro football team for many years I've seen a few shoulder injuries and so it is fairly easy to figure that out but I don't have X ray vision so I Would refer out for like I said the MRI okay I'm outside of that\nBasically it's too it's a two weeks of just activities of daily living then you'll do some sterile van\nLoad jak rehab at home okay I Do need to see it three times a week like a physical therapist and that's not that's not necessary most people are pretty smart when I'm going to get them as we just got me down you\nKnow and just make sure that we are yeah I like that yeah [laughter] we all understand what we're saying your doctors and nurses we can talk right over people [laughter] so no most of the stuff is pretty simple and easy it's relatively inexpensive especially when we're talking about for robberies jaguars ...\nAnd I had a call why you guys are talking and on this is about probably but many people are thinking as they're listening to all of that stature frost I Know I did um we all talk about\nGosh 'cause I Know what surgery costs for talking if I don't have insurance up to a hundred of thousands of dollars absolutely and by seeing you I'm On it just really a sure everybody\nDoes it we're not talking hundreds of thousands of dollars no no no can you give us kind of like a fall apart because that's what we all kind of want to know and I know we're not going to hold you to lake but what are we talking here as far as the caller\nSeveral thousand dollars okay yeah yeah um and it just depends on what your problems are so you know an e mail only required this but if the new shows up some other\nThings right or tissues and that that does it cost more because the dishes expensive yeah I mean you know we're talking about em the autistic coming from the centers and have to be taken from a you know this is scheduled civilian section so you know they have to go through the FDA process and they have it has to cost something for the questioning they have to do the blood work up to make sure there's no pathogens going and\nThen the ATV the American association of tissue bank\nUm they are trained for this a train than a person that\nUsed a skeptic techniques to process is going from a sterile environment for the section into a sterile environment got it and then it has to be washed it has to be you know shift it has to be and these are all done by medical personnel and or train staff that are certified to handle this with precision and an advocacy\nAnd so that all goes in and some fortunately it's a little expensive but let me tell you something how valuable as your shoulder\nExactly you can't really put a value on saints\nI mean you know we're talking about em the autistic coming from a sensitive than have to be taken from a you know this is scheduled civilian section so you know they have to go through the FDA process and they have it has to cost something for the questioning they have to do the blood work up to make sure there's no pathogens going and then the ATV the American association of tissue bank\nUm they are trained for this plane persons that\nUse a skeptic techniques to process is going from a sterile environment for the section into a sterile environment got it and then has to be washed it has to be you know shift it has to be and these are all done by medical personnel and or train staff that are certified to handle this with precision and an advocacy\nAnd so that all goes in and some fortunately it's a little expensive but let me tell you something how valuable as your shoulder\nExactly you can't really put a value on St Jamie How old is your shoulder pay anything for no pain [laughter] very valuable okay fair I mean you can't use your arm I couldn't use my arm I mean it was scary\nYeah yeah ... and and you can't put a price on fear right you can't do that and it's ... and not just physically but mentally and it puts you in a state you\nKnow what I Want us to really come back down to it's affordable Oh absolutely it's it's yeah they might not it is that it's not affordable you've got it is a very affordable I mean if you look at it over twelve month Perrier an Eighteen month period if some payments and stuff you know what it's worth it\nYou know for two hundred dollars a month you know for a payment plan or something like that that you put yourself on yeah it's when I'm just I'm sure you\nKnow we have ways that you can get them out at a at a zero percent right is\nThat we're not talking hundreds of thousands of dollars that you have to mortgage your house is don't end up selling my jaguar [laughter] or\nMight say that one for you [laughter]\nBut I don't know they wreck yeah so it just so if you really you can't really put a value no no no no but I just want to put ... to tell our listeners to you know you got to look at it too is you know quit going out to movies and now to eat and all of that you know and put your money back into your body into your house well\nAnd and you know that's I Want to lighten up a little bit on that you know how about we just cut down going to the movies and cut down on living and going out in the eating but I'm just using that as an example of a hundred percent yeah absolutely\nAnd I'm you know that's the thing is where are your priorities how fast you want to get better you know and how how much do you not want to work okay nobody really wants to work on thinking but [laughter]\nHopefully everybody's retired and we're not however what I Want to say is there is a guy who I really wanted to call in the day and and I don't know what happened I was looking forward to hearing from so I'm going to tell his story\nOK his name is Ken mhm he came to me a couple of years ago and he had two surgeries on one shoulder\nAnd he had three torn rotator cuff muscles not complete chairs 'cause he would have had to have another surgery if that was the case he had degenerative arthritis in the joints where the shoulder bone actually is and then on top where there is what's it called a sea join your generation their\nVotes shoulders absolutely debilitating\nThe man was fifty two years old what did he do for a living he did nothing for sixteen years prior oh boy he was out of work oh he was struggling in all areas of his life mhm\nHe actually worked for a large company throughout the world and he worked in the automotive area and so he was handling heavy tires region overhead oil changes stuff like that could not do any of it\nAnd we were able to help him with the tissue and I believe it was about three months later he was back to full work doing anything he wanted throwing tires changing how Good Wife whatever it is and he he could do anything and that was about two years ago he and I still keep in touch wow\nJoin your generation their votes shoulders absolutely debilitating the man was fifty two years old what'd you do for a living he did nothing for sixteen years prior oh boy he was out of work oh he was struggling in all areas of his life mhm\nHe actually worked for a large company throughout the world and he worked in the automotive area and so he was handling heavy tires region overhead oil changes stuff like that could not do any of it\nAnd we were able to help him with the tissue\nAnd I believe it was about three months later he was back to full work doing anything he wanted throwing tires changing how Good Wife whatever it is and he he could do anything and that was about two years ago he and I still keep in touch wow and is absolutely amazing what this can do so we talk about\nCost mhm what does that cost him sixteen years of inactivity possibly finances you know we started out that up and\nI'm Sorry I just I just have to ask you when you come in and I will ask you how bad do you want to get better if this is the right solution for you and we talk about time and we'll see if you can put the timing and then we'll talk about cause I'm very transparent everything's in right into my office and you get to decide what you want to do um I just want to educate you\nAfter examining you and give you the solutions and allow you the freedom to make the choice of what you'd like to do look if you want to do surgery I'm sure not going to try and prevent you from doing that this is this is our choice and I want you to have that opportunity to\nSay no I don't have to do surgery or I'd rather try not to do surgery like my eighty one year old patient who is now almost\nOut of paying with bone on board and I hope it stays that way of course but uh yeah of course what's what's the cost Jamie I mean I I Can't imagine being as young as you are and having to go through that and not be able to go water skiing or whatever it is you enjoy doing in Alabama with the\nL L I couldn't pick up my kids like grocery shopping was hard um it was yes it was very difficult I really wish they would've known about this and and gone a different route\nYeah and this is the opportunity to be able to go a different route one possible um and this is what we would offer people get out of pain get off of the opiates get back to work hug

vomiting\nNumbness in extremities and problems in speaking at a certain people in worst case scenario is blindness strokes and even death can result unfortunately because there are multiple there are multiple causes of migraines and multiple possible treatments preventing and treating migrants may take some detective work as well as some trial and error approaches to treatment\nThe good news is that in many cases drastic reductions in their frequency and even permanent prevention\nMay be possible since migraines a billions to medical expenses yearly not including lost productivity in the workplace getting a good diagnosis improper treatment is definitely worth while\nWhile the various prescriptions a prescription medications are available there often accompanied by undesirable side effects and are not completely effective they are actually over twenty causes of migrants that have been determined and that could be food allergies nutrient efficiencies chemical sensitivities\nHormonal imbalances which we've talked about on the show with estrogen dominance and ... and the insects says pesticides and the meat to all that stuff hypoglycemia and even deed hydrate dehydration so a lot of different different issues some of the foods that can cause problems in migraines ah or things such as sweet\nCorn dairy and eggs a magnesium is often a deficient nutrient with migraine so that's one thing they might want to consider and that's where a good multi comes into play because having not adequate amount of magnesium is really key and there are USDA studies that have been done showing there's severe\nMagnesium deficiency in our soils and since your body does not produce that\nThat's very important to get adequate magnesium and says supplementing becomes a big a\nBig issue or chemicals that can provoke migraines include MSG mano sodium glutamate a common preservative want to avoid that are also a flavor an answer I aspartame which we talked about and melodies segment 'em and you know not just aspartame but\nSue Grillo ASL so fame K. that's also called ace Kay all those things can be problematic in relation to migraines a nitrates that's often founded pork products like bacon\nSausage nitrogen nitrate not thinking you know is that at whole foods they have healthy bake and that is nitrate and nitrate free\nAnd nitrogen nitrates also inhibits\nOxygen flow and your body and since I like to do cardiovascular fitness to run by do things like that I don't want any of those things because that can be very problematic because you want to get more than enough oxygen and I don't want anything to restrict my oxygen flow\nYou know so again I appreciate some things whole foods does and with a bake and that's a that's a biggie 'cause I don't want to give that up either\nI'm also Tyrone means which is an amino acids found in chocolate and cheese those can be problematic so just chocolate and she's alone because they naturally contain timing can be problematic some people feel sulfites ah\nCan cause headaches or but this is controversial sulfites a occur naturally in some foods they're also found in winds are often times so that's where I get a drink ah you know sort of a natural wind salt\nAnd nitrates free and nitrogen nitrates also inhibits oxygen flow in your body and since I like to do cardiovascular fitness to run by do things like that I don't want any of those things because that can be very problematic because you want to get more than enough oxygen and I don't want anything to restrict my oxygen\nFlow you know so again I appreciate some things whole foods does and with the baking that's a that's a biggie 'cause I don't want to give that up either\nI'm also tire means which is an amino acid found in chocolate and cheese those can be problematic so just chocolate and she's alone because they naturally contain charming can be problematic some people feel sulfites\nCan cause headaches or but this is controversial sulfites a occur naturally in some foods they're also found in winds are often times so that's where I get a drink ah you know sort of a natural wind sulfites are hard to avoid but that's all this now should\nBe yeah should be avoided we have friends that they do some natural\nLike their Italian and why and how they think of themselves and there's no nitrates than not they were big wine drinkers but it was like wow that's cool I've and wind that system nitrate or a ... sorry it's great um hormonal imbalances or more prevalent and women and may involve estrogen or protests are on\nWomen should pay attention to the timing of migrants relating to their menstrual cycles hypoglycemia excessively low blood sugar can be remedied by eating frequent some small meals\nDehydration can obviously be fixed by drinking more water so those are just some of the issues surrounding migraine but\nIt is a very a broad issue and as it needed said there's some detective work that I Need to be done but all those things can relate to migrants to the bottom line is you just in our house we try and avoid nitrate tonight tries to be we don't\nWe don't really drink so we don't get ... you know we try and eat a limit our simple sugar intake you know you just you know and and the chocolate and cheese there are Jesus or don't have as many tiring means but you know in our house we\nTold them look aged cheddar because it has very low lactose there are things you can do practically to sort of hedge so you don't get migraine but anyway all that to say there's a there's a lot of things that can be involved with migraines so you just want to do what you can\nNow all this than the food they the wine and cheese and the chocolate and the bacon so\nYeah right well [laughter] ... I might I might get one of those rude comments a laugh or not I don't know admiring that you might be a lot sadder now [laughter] anyway um\nSo are we also want to do are getting to know you segments of the I'm going to kick it over to you for bringing that to the forefront\nAll right so this week's code forgetting nail you is the word winner\nW. I. N. N. E. R. and I've spent a loser so it certainly is well and day in regards to that we're going to have you trained gas to had a relative he'll always helps them to win and if you had a relative\nWho was always winning\nSo your point is who had a relative that was sort of helping them cheat to win is that your point exactly it's kind of harsh\n[laughter] anyway well we'll let you know more at the end and that you can let that sim or in the end somewhere between now and the end of the show\nAnyway as we both have some fun little stories to share as far as winter goes W. I. N. N. E. R. that'll be the credit for this week but right on in too hyper thyroid as I'm Rick I Know there's some great information here that you've got to share with everybody\nYes and a lot of this information actually we've gotten from Dr ... 'cause you know he has a clinic as he mentioned he sees patients to suffer from hyper thyroid ism and hyper thyroid ism can I can actually be what's known as graves disease so when your thyroid is over active and people just\nWho was always winning so your point is who had a relative that was sort of helping them cheat to win is that your point exactly [laughter] it's kind of harsh\n[laughter] anyway well we'll let you know more at the end and that you can let that sim or in the end somewhere between now and the end of the show\nAnyway as we both have some fun little stories to share as far as winter ... and any I that'll be the credit for this week but right on in too hyper thyroid as him right now there's some great information here that you've got to share with everybody\nYes and a lot of this information actually we've gotten from Dr ... 'cause you know he has a clinic as he mentioned he sees patients to suffer from hyper thyroid ism\nAnd hyper thyroid ism can I can actually be what's known as graves disease so when you're a sigh rate is over active and people that suffer from hyper thyroid ism or graves disease are often very thin\nBecause when you're a thyroid is over active you're going to have a very high metabolism and that's not necessary problem for some people sometimes I Wish I was a little more hyper thyroid but\nNot that I'm really overweight but I live yeah I've you know you always kind of fighting that battle a little bit so but for people that have it it goes far beyond that and not just being thin but you can be muscle weakness and you know\nTremors and all kinds of problems which will get into later but anyway um basically I Want to read a suddenly doctors fingers written on hyper thyroid isn't just for your information so this condition occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much of the thyroid hormones known as\nIraq than T for and I I oh thigh ruining T. three since I read hormones increase the metabolism self ah one can experience many symptoms relating to high metabolism these include\nIrregular heartbeat nervousness sudden weight loss insomnia and rapid heartbeat so there you have there is some basic things that\nAre obviously not comfortable for a lot of people irregular heartbeat can be\nVery concerning uh the most common cause is an autoimmune condition known as graves disease this condition is more common and women over the age of twenty as the immune system attacks the thyroid gland it stimulates the release of an anti body known as ... wrote trope in receptor anti body or T. R. A. B.\nWhich causes the thyroid to make excessive amounts of thyroid hormones conventional therapy offers three main treatment options anti thyroid medications that you press the production of thyroid hormones\nRadioactive iodine which destroys the thyroid gland and surgical removal of the thyroid and I don't know about you guys but none of those sound like particularly\nA a good options now now not yeah those who receive radioactive iodine or surgery will develop hypo thyroid isn't in the last I write activity which that requires thyroid hormone supplementation for the rest of their lives so I had a girlfriend that's in that position\nAnd this is just so in my mind just so wrong and it just again we mentioned not all drugs are bad but you've got to be very judicious and break careful when you take drugs because the drug companies are not in the business to\nFix or cure your problem there in the business of selling products in the way they do that is by managing helping you to manage your symptoms so they say oh here we're getting is radioactive die or a iodine which will go into your thyroid\nAnd it will kill your thyroid and then oh now you've got loads already had high thyroid now you got low third so now we need to give you a sense right for the rest of your life you know we say make money on so\nThere are better solutions and we're going to go with some of those on the show but we want to make sure that you look at the\nNatural alternatives first we're not advocating every taking drugs were saying certainly will take the natural approach\nAnd this is just so in my mind just so wrong and just again we've mentioned not all drugs are bad but you've got to be very judicious in very careful when you take drugs because the drug companies are not in the business to\nFix or cure your problem there in the business of selling products in the way they do that is by managing helping you to manage your symptoms so they say oh here we're getting this radioactive star\nOr a iodine which will go into your thyroid and it will kill your thyroid and then oh now you've got a lot of hype I right now you got low third so now we need to give you a sense right for the rest of your life you know we say make money on so\nThere are better solutions and we're going to go over some of those on the show but we want to make sure that you look at the\nNatural alternatives first\nWe're not advocating every taking drugs were saying certainly will take the natural approach first see if it's going to work for you and then look at drugs if you have to um so hyper thyroid as I'm concerned as the river solely with natural therapy when\nIt's treated in the early stages the root causes of the auto immune response such a stress\nHormone imbalance chronic infections are gluten allergy must be identified and treated otherwise natural therapies can be integrated with anthrax I read medications such as a method a maze all to maintain a better thyroid doubt so even if you take drugs you can balance it out with a natural therapy so you don't have to take such high dosages by\nField so the rise of barley the wheat fields are quite often very close to the field so that's why there can be concerned about gluten contamination and oats I'm also Casey and free a diet so a diet free is cow's milk and you can also avoid artificial dyes coloring sweeteners and simple\nYes and you know going back to your testing techniques um that's one of the things you you might be getting the sense that this hyper thyroid isn't it's not something generally that you can go into health food store and say oh I Need yourself meant for hyper thyroid at them in fact we do not have a supplement that can really\nEffectively deal with this issue is a it's a very comprehensive approach to you have to take with it and when he talked about this testing techniques those are things that are done in a medical clinic so this is where we would encourage people\nOr you know the ... Center for integrative medicine down in ... Dr singer is um\nAnd he's not asking us to say this by the way I just you know we're friends and and he does a great job he\nDoes blood work on myself my wife my kids every year um this is the kind of thing where you really do want to go see some sort of integrated doctor that can help you but we are going to give you some practical or things that you might try that might be helpful but I think our recommend\nSince that this hyper thyroid ism is not something generally that you can go on a health food store and say oh I Need yourself meant for hyper thyroid has some effect we do not have a supplement that can really\nEffectively deal with this issue is a\nIt's a very comprehensive approach so you have to take with us and when he talked about this testing technique those are things that are done in a medical clinic so this is where we would encourage people or you know the ... Center for integrative medicine down in ... Dr singer is um\nAnd he's not asking us to say this by the way I just you know we're friends and and he does a great job he does blood work on myself my wife my kids every year um this is the kind of thing where you really do want to go see some sort of\nIntegrated doctor that can help you but we are going to give you some practical or things that you might try that might be helpful but I think our recommendation it'd be to be more comprehensive and your approach\nWell and one of the things that is it's sad I\nIs that a lot of regular MDs do not\nLook at the blood work in the same way they don't do the same kind of comprehensive panels that natural politic\nMedical physician like Dr ... so you know yes we encourage if you're near Dr ... go visit his clinic and or find a good natural path in your area and natural Catholic and medical doctor because you're going to get more and you're going to get a more comprehensive evaluation that will really help determine what you need to\nYour issues right that's that's really important so anyway ah without we wanted to talk about a few supplements that there there is some research on and things that might help uh there's one a homeopathic a product out there are so many paths like I owe them I owed ... am\nAnd uh it's been recommended to take to palate of\nThirty see potency three times daily for five days or to tell us of a two hundred see one time only so this might not be something that's easy to find but this is the first recommendation that Dr singer houses that homeopathic I owe them so again\nTo tell us of eight thirty see potency three times daily for five days or two ... two hundred and see one time only so and then you know\nYou see if there's an improvement if there isn't than ah than do not repeat treatments best centers supervision about how many the path a practitioner says but then also sending more simple as a ... that's a view G L E a weed bugle we take to middle leaders three times daily bugle we contains organic acids\nThat are believed to inhibit antibody binding to the thyroid gland so that's\nThat's something I I don't know if you'll find that in helping or not you may have to look on the Internet but that would be a teacher so bugle weed\nAnd then carnitine this is something you can find any health food store and interestingly there was a study in the journal of Andrew cannot endocrinology and metabolism and it found that out carnitine supplementation significantly alleviate symptoms associated with hyper thyroid ism\nThe randomized double blind placebo controlled six month trial involved fifty women\nThe research has found that two thousand four thousand milligrams daily of oral L carnitine was able to relieve many symptoms associated with hyper thyroid as I read his him without any toxicity or medication or interaction and that that's really key so if you're on medication you can take this and based on this study\nThere were no issues so it would also help to reduce elevated liver enzymes so relatively inexpensive he lives in ... healthy it's ... it is and there's different types of carnitine in by carnitine HDL or carnitine tar trait\nIs one that's more stable the other kind of cartoons are very high ... which means they suck moisture out of the air and then the castles tend to stick together\nIf it can only alleviate symptoms associated with hyper thyroid isn't\nThe randomized double blind placebo controlled six month trial involved fifty women\nThe research has found that two thousand four thousand milligrams daily of oral L carnitine was able to relieve many symptoms associated with hyper thyroid as I read his him without any talks a CD or medication or interaction and that's actually key so if you're on medication you can take this and based on this study\nThere were no issues so it also helps to reduce elevated liver enzymes so relatively inexpensive too isn't it ... it is and there's different types of carnitine in by carnitine HDL a carnitine tar trade\nIs one that's more stable the other kind of cartoons are very high ... which means they suck moisture out of the air and then the castles tend to stick together so carnitine tar trade is very very uh it's a good form of carnitine a so any way you want to make sure on label it's the elemental carnitine should say carnitine on this submarine facts\nThen in parentheses that you'd say tar trade if it just says carnitine charging no prints he's\nIt's only a sixty seven percent strength material so if it says a thousand milligrams you only getting six hundred and Seventy milligrams of L carnitine so if it's in France sees than they have to\nDo in the manufacturing process they have to adjust to make sure you're getting the dosing if pure pure carnitine and then\nYou know but that's that's how it's done on the label so if it's in parentheses with carnitine with minerals that's in your game the actual elemental amount of the active so what you should do is take a thousand milligrams two to four times daily uh so that's that's really key so L carnitine and uh we're almost out of time so when we come back\nWe're going to be talking about a few other prescription that can help and then we want to spend a little bit of time I want to talk about something called ... therapy this is something that I've done personally it's

college you\nAt this year's meeting nearly forty thousand attendees gather to discuss the growing body of data on advance difficult to treat diseases that do not have many treatment options\nAnd you know ... by a pharmaceutical company dedicated to improving health and health related quality of life\nFor patients with cancer auto immune and other serious diseases in our interview we speak to a doctor he'll about some of the exciting developments that are taking place at this year's meeting including some of the data that his company presented about advancements in the development of targeted anti cancer drugs such as anti buddy drug conjugate\nTraditional chemotherapy often feels who treated ... forms of cancer because well chemotherapy disrupt tumors it also harms other healthy cells in turn this makes it difficult to deliver potent anti cancer drugs without costing too much harm to healthy cells\nAntibody drug called ... which also known as a de Cheech and the other hand are a form of targeted anti cancer drugs that are able to target the tumor cells both sparing healthy cells these means that more of an anti cancer drug can be delivered to the humor with less side effects\nHowever developing successful antibody drug ... has remained a challenge for several decades and to date only four different forms of ... which have been approved for the treatment of various forms of cancer as\nWe speak reductive peel about some of the latest data pretended about a first in ... drug and how ... can be used for the treatment of advanced or make a study triple negative breast cancer\nCancer's the most common tumor type worldwide intend to twenty percent of breast cancers or what it's called triple negative breast cancer\nAnd the type of cancer the tumor itself lack the expression or amplification of targeting all biomarkers such as receptors for estrogen project throat and human ... growth factor receptive to also known as her too\nBecause in the type of cancer the cancer does not have the most common types of receptors known to field I'm a cancer growth common treatments like hormone therapy and drugs that target estrogen project shown and hurt you or ineffective hence the name triple negative\nUdall chemotherapy to treat triple negative breast cancer it's still an effective option intact triple negative breast cancer may respond even better to chemotherapy in the early stages and many other\nEvents are meant to study triple negative breast cancer\nCancer's the most common tumor type worldwide intend to twenty percent of breast cancers or

common treatments like hormone therapy and drugs that target estrogen projects Joan and hurt you or ineffective hence the name triple negative\nUsing chemotherapy to treat triple negative breast cancer it's still an effective option intact triple negative breast cancer may respond even better to chemotherapy in earlier stages and many other forms of cancer but this type of cancer is extremely hard to treat and generally has a poor prognosis\nAs many as fifty percent of patients diagnosed with early stage triple negative breast cancer that stages one two three experience disease occurrence and thirty seven percent of patients die in the first five years after surgery\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back the younger she burns and if you're just joining us we're talking with Dr Michael ...\nOf immediate medics about some of the exciting news and that strikes presented at at twenty Eighteen annual meeting of the American society of Clinical Oncology ethical which took like June first to fear in Chicago Illinois\nThe team of this year's meeting it's delivering discoveries expending to reach of proceeds should medicine let's go back to the program so\nIn in the spending that kind of drug addict and an anti drug ... being able to hear being very targeted ...\nIf you look at a payload to being used to teach more or less a traditional chemotherapy drug ... uh but it's also used in different ... right and it also using different I'm not in a form of navy she um each being used in different treatments\nIs that the mother compound right and the mother compound it's actually metabolized and deliver it to the ... which is that since fifty eight right\nA lot of the top of night about a a part of this transformation from during the peak on to a sense that he ate a responsible for that took the city so if you're working with the active metabolize you already have an advantage\nIt's an fifty eight by itself it's not easy to use because it's it's not very soluble ... short lived so the ...\nWe're being very targeted [noise]\nIf you look at ... or the payload ... being used to teach more or less a traditional chemotherapy drug ... but it's also used in different areas ... right and it also using different I'm not in a form of native she um each being used in different treatments\nImmunity can is that the mother compound right and the mother compound it's actually metabolized and deliver to the ... which is ... write\nA lot of the metabolites that are a part of this transformation from Iran which he can to and said he ate a responsible for the toxicity so if you're working with the active metabolize you already have an advantage\nIt's an fifty eight by itself is not easy to use because it's it's not very soluble short lived\nSo the idea was actually really to kind of views that active metabolites and find it to an antibody to make it to get labeled make almost like a pro drug exactly to make it stable uh and so and then thirty eight itself is not you know she kind of Jews but comes along with some difficulties\nAnd the ... one inhibits I had a he must have logical toxicity and Guthrie intestinal took to the city\nIt's in thirty eight as a matter of fact when it's bound to the antibody and brought to the to my head so much less side effects so the logical toxicity goes down the gastrointestinal talk to you to go down that you can in Homs the concentration of the active metabolites that the tumor so that's not the whole trickier\nI make making a better drug out or something of that re circulate executive right so ... beyond looking at is the drugs are being used in a in a very difficult to treat each a triple negative press cancer now give me a little bit of a description of triple negative breast cancer and white issue of difficult to treat\nAnd it really comes with the word triple negative because it's got a lot of the program that have been made in the past decade in Britain concept comes through targeted therapies\nAgainst her too which is an antigen uh um and then you can use an antibody against it or against a hormone receptors ... you can you set up against\nUh the problem of triple negative press conference it's not expressing these uh antigens so you can't use targeted therapy [noise]\nUm now what our drug it's done and I think that's the first that put the company has been figuring out to say is actually a an antigen on on vulture for like a different kinds of self that you can use photography and that's a\nThat's a big fit I'm due to the fact that there is no targeted therapies available are the only available therapy for these patients is chemotherapy\nAnd when patients are in the mid Atlantic state and when they saw one or two chemotherapies be fun to have a very bad prognosis\nVery little response rates very low duration of responds and and that's the direction of response to the weeks that you're talking about it like a and actually when you're thinking about the overall survival each patient prognosis like an acute leukemia patients\nIt's probably fair way to to think about it if you are an advancement that's probably true but it could have spent concept patient your prognosis is as bad as a patient with a male\nOr a ... truck has been approved for these patients and we ... have been a running a studies in both patients and payment coming up with data and also data that we've been using for mission that show very good response rate\nLoan generational for his bones for those patients and that's very good uh I'm told her ability prefer that book up to the basis for a mission to actually until you're\nTalking about the mission um there's a presentation hear an echo that Britain ... about another\nRight a and actually when you're thinking about the overall survival each patient prognosis like an acute leukemia patients it's probably fair way to to think about it if you are an advancement of traffic trip and it could have spent concept patient your prognosis is as bad as a patient with him out\nI'm known truck has been approved for these patients and we ... have been a running a study in both patients and came and coming up with data and also data that we've been using for the mission that show very good response rate\nLoan generational for his bones for those patients and that's very good uh I'm told her ability prefer that puts up to the basis for a mission that actually until you're\nNot talking about the mission um there's a presentation hear an echo\nThat Britain ... about another very important group of patients which are expressing the homeowner is it that so called H O e a positive mentality let's come to patients\nThese patients are usually starting when they made a study with home on Saturday or the home on set up you know these days combined with a with the kitty for six inhibitors\nAre to decay for ... and you have a have not the John forgive enter and neighborhoods but then the the hormone therapy come to an end and patients are progressing and then the most out of ...\nUsually these patients get onto cycling or they get a kind of one line of type of thing but if patients undergo hormone therapy out CKY and one nine of chemo that broke noted is as bad as it is for the patients were tripping negative comments consent\nAnd that's where we are actually very excited and keeping a lead into also when we're looking at our data we have response rates above Seventy percent\nUm compared to the usual low teens that you get with chemotherapy in that setting and we will certainly talk to more also about the situation on the progression free survival of the space in which we again feel it's a it's a great segue and the starting point for people to Johnny Depp you want to take\nLike now I Want to circle back a little bit to triple negative breast cancer and into kind of patients that are suffering from the ... particular regrets if they teach 'em tell me a little bit about the patient population\nYeah that was trying to say I'm at the starting point is is we all um and knowing patience with breast cancer ... many of our um no these patients into\nA family and and write and friends and and\nBreast cancer patients on not all the same and when you're talking to a patient with triple negative spreads concept um their feel is that there are a neglected group of patients because all the progress that had been made with all these new drugs and all the approval of is enough progress that they have been experiencing and and\nDaddy it's much more aggressive biologically they have a very different paths enough metastases very often they have brain metastases for example\nAnd ... percent of the organs as compared to bone metastases that's with other patients with bread crumbs I mean\nI have a much higher risk of relapse after the initial therapy so the whole biology it's different prognosis it's much worse like an acute leukemia patients and there's no drug debatable patients so it's actually really an eclectic group of patients\nUh and it's not a small group it's round about ten to Fifteen Percent of all the patients uh with mental study breast cancer and we have very very happy and fortunate to finally hopefully bring program at least ...\nRight [noise] um no\nSome subject matter that may\nDaddy the it's much more aggressive ... they have a very different paths enough metastases very often they have brain metastases for example\nAnd metastases of the organs as compared to bone metastases with other patients with bread crumbs I hadn't\nI have a much higher risk of relapse after the initial therapy so the whole biology it's different the prognosis it's much worse like an acute leukemia patients and there's no drug debatable ... patients so it's actually really an eclectic group of patients\nUh and it's not a small group it's round about ten to Fifteen Percent of all the patients uh with metal study breast cancer and we have very very happy and fortunate to finally hopefully\nBring program at least ... right [noise] um no\nSome subject matter to me I'm\nNot necessarily dealing with your company a but more in a broader scope of I'm asked co um some of the treatment options that are out there\nYou being here now for a maybe a day maybe a little bit longer or looking at some of the advantage in in in clinical development in in in college you um\nOther than the very great news that you're actually bringing for a very specific patient population what are some of the things that\nExcites you outside of this area\nI think it's a great point then it stops within that tangible but it's increasingly good understanding in deep understanding of the biology of the diseases that we are dealing with mhm\nThat's actually an area where although we are in a small company we're investing loss that go on the spending the biology of all taught at the impact that it has a in predictive terms and put them in ... not to come up just as a target\nUm relapse patterns of those patients I'm I think the bases of making the real step forward for all of those indications are that you get a good it's this very thorough and deep understanding of not just a target than the biology of the disease and that's exactly what we try to do to do the next step\nAnd that that's certainly a lot of exciting data here in the areas that are interesting for us with checkpoint inhibitors ...\nBut we want to figure out a together with other companies is to identify the exact patient population a defining molecularly\nUm that then gets the right to come in a total approach in order to improve that prognosis so what always excites me when they come to these meetings if the\nProgress in the acceleration of the understanding of the biology ... and we absolutely a and will be part of this and that allows it to them very targeted\nSelect the right come into the approach that we're going to go together with our cynical partnerships that people do let's take a short break here\nBoth [noise]\nMost of us like at the time that fight sunscreen and other safety measures are key to bring your skin and aging and can't be happy I recommend anything is frame of the\nHere\n\nMost of us like to be out in the sun that's my sunscreen and other safety measures are key to protecting your skin and aging in cancer the FDA recommends using a sunscreen with the sun protection factor\nEvery development in every approval off a truck I think comes along with the need for very thorough a side effect management of patients because by the patient that you're seeing in the real life maybe older maybe more fragile or maybe have maybe have more commodities\nAnd the worst thing that can happen is a drug like out in the hands of someone with not being totally educated but I ... through literature and that round thing we absolutely want to make sure we put a lot of effort into it and the second answer that wants to give it that way when we're thinking outside of the U.S\nA lot of the and you're coming from a country of rare reimbursement a and the economic benefits actually tied to um showing the value in real life population actually so we are in the situation where we have to come up\nA bridge the data for the ... population very very early on that's great way to do it on now that data sets available that were not available for five to ten years ago\nBut if you even think about getting reimbursement in Europe and that's something that we absolutely want to do and if you think about having successful discussions also with pay us here in the U.S [noise] you have to come up a with real life data\nI think that's a natural sequence of things here are the company you start with you a pivotal study or you want to make sure that as we've been discussing you come up with a ride\nUm life cycle plan and coming a thorough approach it according to the in ... understanding of the study but I'm very thankful that you say that they said it's very important element which is\nA value proposition in abroad population and the ability to show and show can stop in a in a meaningful way and that's exactly what's on next step is going to look like\nThat combined with a very thorough education on ah the profile of the drugs that side effects of the drugs but then also how to treat and prevent side effects we we're going to take this very very very serious every patient that you're losing suicide effect for me it's a tragedy\nRight and that brings you also the or the next question to some extent if you look at a clinical trials I'm about\nFour to five percent of 'em are people that actually diagnosed with a particular form of cancer or overall participation in clinical trials each between four and five percent roughly\n[noise] uh the value proposition in abroad population and the ability to show and show 'cause that in a in a meaningful way and that's exactly what's our next step is going to look like\nThat combined with a very thorough education on ah the profile of the drugs that side effects of the drugs but then also how to treat and prevent side effects we we're going to take this very very very serious every patient that you're losing suicide effect for me it's a tragedy\nRight and that brings you also the or the next question to some extent if you look at a clinical trials I'm about\nFour to five percent of 'em are people that actually diagnosed with a particular form of cancer or overall participation in clinical trials it's between four and five percent roughly\nUm how can you you increase the number so there was a study presented either today or tomorrow I'm not sure uh which actually talks about eliminating the inclusion of exclusion correct exclusion criteria what they came up with as a result is that it's may\nUltimately you'll one percent increase in participation in the clinical trial\nI'm all for that clinical trials of those people that actually participate the larger number or white male or female patients I'm and we're not talking about it\nA lot of people that are either black or Hispanic and then you had so in order to get a better ID or functioning about boats boats clinical trials how can we include or\nIncreased the number of patients are participating political trials at the same time maybe increase the number off of blacks and Hispanics that might increase in in in that particular way\nCouldn't agree more and and and that is\nThat that has always been an issue and it's unfortunately it's still is an issue um days by the way indications that up doing slightly better than other indications um and we should learn from them when we were looking at some of the logical malignancy is um\nI Would make an argument that the proportion of patients going into those studies and significantly higher\nSo I think as a starting point I'm trying to learn from each other a and and see what other uh doing well enough to well it's a it's a great starting point number one\nNumber two is is I think that an obligation of communication um to start with um when it comes to clinical study not just in clinical trials that go off to the patient organizations and using all the wonderful in that case wonderful new media opportunities that you're having\nAnd having a credible communication with keg events and patients so that they understand the value a and the purpose of a clinical study and how they can profit from that\nI think the sad thing and we've been touching upon that I I\nI personally believe that that you could probably position at at participation in clinical studies I Would say like the ability to document the sick and see and I'm the benefit written profile of a drug\nUm throughout and not trust during a pivotal studies or in phase one foot face to face three but throughout back to that kind of this notion of we want to have\nReal life data in order to learn how whether we are doing\nAnd how we how we can improve upon where we'd given the drunk how were given the drunk and how we do many side effects that's a very important part of it and and I think that's something where we as an industry can certainly do much better I can assure you that this is something that we're going to do\nA lot right or if you bring a ... like our\nI personally believe that that you could put the position that participation in clinical studies I Would say like the ability to document the tickets to see and I'm the benefit written profile of a drug\nUm throughout and not just during pivotal studies or in phase one for it to a phase three but throughout back to kind of this notion of we want to have\nReal life data in order to learn how whether we are doing and how we how we can improve upon where we'd given the drug how were given the drunk and how we doing side effect that's a very important part of it\nAnd and I think that's something where we as an industry can certainly do much better I can assure you that this is something that we're going to do a lot right or if you bring a drug like our into late land populations\nYou want to understand how patients are doing you want to have metrics and being able to measure whether the side effects recommendations that you're giving a working or are not working right\nAnd so that's another area where we are going to put a lot of efforts in because we feel everybody's profiting from federal documentation and review of how the drug doing are we doing well other physicians doing well and then ultimately of course that leads to the question is pay our patients doing well now\nThat means for example larger population based studies maybe ... or ... or observational ...\nAnd ... and I think that's that way though you can do it and it's also a wonderful way to know of at the turn of data capture them and I I think that's multiple weights and we're all going all of them\nLet's take a short break if you're just joining us we're speaking with

when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident and I said\n... you have a little tiny house how could your purview however bilby so high I said there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and heart goes from ATF and the third piece because atheists mentor people had some news or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake ... let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nUm I used you know gee there's lots of people out there that can make hamburger okay I'm up at these things but there's only one that has the secret sauce now\nSecret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management let me talk about that would see on our built this thing called demanded a lot of people an atheist this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe ... team point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just day regular one two three and\nAnd what that is is a PS created these amazing rape plans selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hottest I'm of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopolies are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest today oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of ...\nThirteen point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three ten\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power of the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hottest I'm of the day between three and have him and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\nThere's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it\nSo the smart energy management the way that the analogy of the people like like that I've been told is remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance\nMonday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay it a better rate will their telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends\nThey could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist met her when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when the hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars and forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars um it's the power that you've consumed at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... ... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I say the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay younger ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay for a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS semester you want to raise\nIs to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\nHere for its criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you and I say the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay younger ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay for a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS semester you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect\nYou anymore so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's gonna continue to go up\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them and I explain all this to them\nSo not only are you paying between seven and a half and eat and have since for your kill a lot on your roof\nYour tax credits paying two words the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of the home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your homes Carol and that's the two things I tell people there is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus the electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um it it just it doesn't make sense for them\nThey built in Ukrainian rates everybody should just call you just find out how to read their bill and then I don't know how to read they're real and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if he'll go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site and I do a rate I'm review and break it down on\nIt's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us\nHave been hearing us for a year year and a half and then the natives out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go home now I understand what she rains and so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simply this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and\nAll the time and say I do a rate I'm review and break it down on [noise]\nIt's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half and today there is out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go home now I understand what she runs\nAnd so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and pay two fifty and that's essentially Carol I'm sending people\nOver half off their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS ... today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home we use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid to the power company cut that in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money well here's what we're\nGoing to do we want to give out your phone number because everyone really should just give recall she does a free consultation she's ready to what the better Business Bureau I just found out at that out and uh her phone number direct it six to three\nEight five zero eight two two nine she wants you to go up on her website it is asked solar Sandy dot com go to ask makes sure at ... dot com\nFill out the kilowatt worksheet and she can help you save money on a bill that you're already paying way too much money on what are your final words for today you know\nIt's it's the simplest is you know I really am on a mission when I helped my daughter it was the first time in a long time due to my circumstances that I was able to do\nSomething really significant in her life 'cause I financially wasn't able to help her but I saw the really big problem for her and it gave me\nA self accomplishment in it she was so ever so grateful then she shared it with her neighbors and a lot of her neighbors did it because the than I was able to help them understand my daughter was able to help them understand it\nSo now it's about I'm there to educate\nAnd give people the the information so that they can make an informed decision about their own power costs they wouldn't let somebody else choose their host what kind of payment they could afford for mortgage they wouldn't let somebody ... ... how much they could afford for car why would people\nUntil maybe since they just haven't got the information yet but let's get Hugh Hugh with the right information you can make an informed decision about your power cause\nShe's valley wide it's no obligation free consultation to you out there she had lots of incentives to that she offers to everyone\nThe number to call her direct it is area code six to three eight five zero eight two two nine go on that website and check out the ... ... feet it's asked sell solar Sandy dot com [noise]\nChoose their house what kind of payment they could afford for market it wouldn't let somebody his car and look how much they could afford for car why would people\nUntil maybe they just haven't got the information yeah but let's get you what the right information you can make an informed decision about your ... cheese valley wide it said no obligation free consultation to you out there she has lots of incentives to that she offers to everyone\nThe number to call her direct idiots area code six to three eight five zero eight two nine go on that website and check out the ... where it's asked sell solar Sandy dot com\nSo you're not only producing your own power between seven and eight cents now a PS is buying that extra power back in your roof is potentially ... you're putting your roof to work and you're putting your that you're leaving no money on your roof 'cause that's what my thing\nSo I must say you have a few of them are I must say this you\nKnow if you've heard ... we've said this before\nThe thing about all of this is that there's different information\nAll the time it's new and that's what's so we're standing all about she does all the research for everybody and then she comes and she taught you it's a no obligation free consultation that you go to them if you give them a a two hundred dollar or whatever it is it's a two hundred and fifty dollar settler ultimate settlers that aiding\nAnd sent to help people when you were installed this is to thank you for for working with me\n... I I work for my family's I'm there to do my best work for them [noise] um I'm not a solar company I'm an energy expert and I actually to educate you about how your electric bills work and all these fees and charges and a gestures and people are really seeing these huge\nDifferences in their bills this year and they're going oh my gosh\nWhy because if you didn't choose your rate plan a PS chose it for you and you're seeing a bill that might have been two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars last year as high as five hundred your might you may be seeing a three hundred dollar bill over six seven hundred dollars and people are quite we're not using any more part they might even be using a little bit less\nThis is only going to get worse if you don't figure this out now to produce your own power pay less for it\nAnd and here's another really important point as wise as it was to go solar previous years and I commend all of my family's that worked with me previous years there's the tax is the the federal and state tax credit is available to you most people that's over ten thousand dollars to you\nAnd then the buyback program a PS has it is is is after August thirty first is TB deep to beat the term so if you are going to do some\nChose it for you and you're seeing a build it might have been two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars last year as high as five hundred you might you may be seeing a three hundred dollar bill over six seven hundred dollars and people are quite we're not using any more power they might even be using a little bit less\nThis is only going to get worse if you don't figure this out now to produce your own power pay less for it\nAnd here's another really important point as wise as it was to go solar previous years and I commend all of my family's that worked with me previous years there's the ... the the the federal and state tax credit is available to you most people that's over ten thousand dollars to you\nAnd then the buyback program a PS has to do is is is after August thirty first it's TB deep to beat the tournament so if you are going to do something this is really the time to do it because there's so many benefits and I say to my family is number one benefit is savings you are going to save\nThousands upon thousands of dollars off your power cost and the other is to live more comfortably in your home why should the power company dictate how much power we use and when we use it now between three and eight PM it's the\nPeak demand power a P. S. S. or peace between one in eight so why should the electric company dictate when we are comfortable that's the hardest time of the day when we get home from work wanting to enjoy our homes that we've worked hard for\nAnd another thing the our power claws stuck in your home is our highest expense that will have in our lifetime so why is consumers you you've gone by your house and you know what you can afford you know kind of car you can afford\nYour ... those should be no different producing your own power and paying less for between seven and eight cents per kilowatt is what it works out to being when you work with me I'm going to show you how to produce your own at between ... and put more of your heart or money back in your pocket not the ...\nI have to say to that you have\nBeen doing this for several years it's not like you just turned around and decided to do that you are very\nEducated basically what she's going to do is talk to you a little bit about how even read your power bill wouldn't it be nice to know what it really means and that way when she educates you know you can do make an informed ... ... ... exactly\nCarole and I mean you know I Love when you say people don't really open their ... just going to pick up the right and they go oh we're just going to pay that\nThat shouldn't be the case this is your home you have basically control over what you consume

one that has the secret sauce so be very careful it's not just about solar panels anymore it's about solar panels in the right amount of them\nCombined with the right rate plan and with smart energy management and that's a whole nother charge on your bill that we need to manage people are seeing this charge an ape yes probably for the very first time hold demand\nAnd that is probably some people were going that's more than my power cost combined with these and the taxes but there's a separate charge for demand we managed that and we medicate that and you live more comfortable in your home paying less for your power that phone number to call a six to three\nAnd I'm going to give you a little bit extra and here's the thing there's a there's other companies that know how to make

end\nAnd a lightning spot opened up\nAnd so this is where I met my mentor Mr de Bryan Shaw and she ran shows a name and\nThe opportunity to help a helping the individual do some flooring um I was running a night crew and I just got to the point where I got tired of\nChristmas Night having to go to work and Thanksgiving night having to go to work and kind of live in that whole lifestyle of of a graveyard shift in dealing floor and kind of gave me more of an open opportunity to be able to\nUm have weekends often and and I liked it I liked the working with my hands and I took quite a bit of a pay cut to to get into the industry and learn it and um\nAnd it's just progressed from their eyes open my my ah first installation company in a in the late nineties which was Taylor installs\nA man I installed flooring for Twenty years and went from the last two years that I was installing I had opened a store which is brand Flora\nUm I was running at night crew and I just got to the point where I got tired of\nChristmas Night having to go to work and Thanksgiving nice having to go to work and kind of living that whole lifestyle of of a graveyard shift in dealing flooring kind of gave me more of an open opportunity to be able to\nUm have weekends off in and and I liked it I liked the working with my hands and I took quite a bit of the pay cut to to get into the industry and learn it and um\nAnd it's just progressed from their eyes open my my ah first installation company in a in the late nineties which was Taylor installs I'm\nIn I installed flooring for Twenty years and went from the last two years that I was installing a hit open to store which is brand foreign uh to kind of set up for the retirement it's a pretty hard trade\nNot one that I wanted to be dealing in my fifties and sixties [noise] um and\nSo the ads\nI open the store I kind of face myself out of insulation and now I Am\nJust doing the sales and overseeing the store seizing warriors ... correct and how long is Brandon\nBrandon spin around going on eight years uh from I've been in an industry for twenty five an hour that map doesn't make sense but there was a couple of years were I was doing all the installs out of my own store\nA fan and so there was that they use and correct yeah it was the boss\nAnd and with growth of of of a business you have to start depending on other people and uh so I got to the point where we were having to hire more people and I've just I've just fades my so I have an insult for five years\nSo you know a lot about different kinds of boring yeah tell us a little bit about different kinds of storing iron and\nWhy some are better than others I'm ordering their application yeah so I'm\nWith the knowledge that that I have with with flooring or different types of carpet work better for different types of situations if you have pets or you have high traffic was there's we have carpet settle little will match that and and hold up to let\n'em tiles it's always going to be your most dependable product\nIt's a terrible as long as it's install correctly you don't want to flying off the floor or would we do would be um and land the floors are a little bit more delicate of a product that take care of them a little bit differently than you do any of the others but if you take care of and the last\n... corporate as well as it was hard for\nEverything carpet child would showers yeah we do everything\nIs our number when I first got out here it's like everything's carpet crowded room wall to wall you know\nAnd you know you always have the static electricity yeah you're on certain touching anybody is that\nYou know and of course some people thought that was funny some people thought that was not funny at our act\nSo what are some of the hardest installs that you had personally as while you were installing 'em\nI I Would say more so um some of the ... the ones that we had to go into maybe with\nUm not not necessarily that that's physical but maybe maybe with um a passing that had to go in and in an intake carpet out of a room or something like that\nUm every every job was hard though does it really hard I didn't really look at one being any harder than other whether it's hard furniture or\nCertain touching anybody like that\nAnd of course some people thought that was funny some people thought that was not funny at our ex\nSo what are

back\nQuite significantly now our tax plan it gets rid of them altogether because we know that\nTaxes corporations don't pay the right folks you know that\nYou know the corporations don't pay taxes they don't they just pass it on at the end of the day otherwise they go out of business right they need to get their numbers their quotas and that's what\nThey did so our taxpayer gets rid of corporate tax rates for Trump's have lower them\nLook what's happening since he's learned dump people are getting higher wages people quitting their jobs because they can get better jobs they're
