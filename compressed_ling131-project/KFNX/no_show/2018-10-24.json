now it's true we have a little time but you know there's going to take a lotta time to build that a barrier in Mexico we're not talking about a structure\nWe're talking about the Mexican government putting a patrol cars tanks whenever they need to do and build a natural barrier and funneled people into that natural barrier and not let them go forward that's what has to happen\nBut Mexico doesn't want to do it for two reasons they don't want them there [noise] they have their own internal problems they can't afford to take care of them nor can wait so what do you deal with the human tidal

have our military there you know with these people within the illegal caravan of of of of immigrants\nWell the answer to that is what would the vermin and the media do what would the fake news men do with the New York times in the Washington Post there were screaming we're not fake news tell me what all the anti Americans who were in high places this tiny percentages maybe one percent of the American population if that in the media who hate\nThis country and especially its sovereignty tell me what that less than one percent of anti American farmers will ... will say tell me\nI'm trying not to get excited but we're being controlled by a very small tiny minority of people in this country who I'm way too much power over the survival of the nation\nIs all about optics it's all about optics you're telling me that these mobs wouldn't make a young woman and baby in a baby carriage be the first into that barbed wire well you know why\nHe is mobs would push the ... the the women and children into the barbed wire and make sure that the the CNN people there make sure that they are ... of the world Akash the American conscience with their fake news\nI think I'm gonna start using the words fake news more now because they don't like it their own complaining that it might cause violence they've already cause violence now they're screaming let's stop it before someone gets hurt a dummy there's been plenty of people heard it on our side\nSo you want to tamp down the rhetoric you want to stop hating Trump for a little while why don't you try that Mr Booker of CNN\nMiss this book or should stop the hatred for a while but let's go back to your uh your point is that the only solution as a barbed wire barrier\nWhat that's what I thought that was my theory but in the same token I can understand where you're coming from their CNN is going to get in and grab this ain't gonna run with it because of all the people innocent people\nAbout the which is on MSNBC what are the which is that I missed him is he going to do with it the anti American anti family anti got anti Christian women on MSNBC what are they going to do with it boy that\nThey've already cause violence now they're screaming let's stop it before someone gets hurt a dummy there's been plenty of people hard on our side\nSo you want to tamp down the rhetoric you want to stop hating Trump for a little while why don't you try that Mr sucker of CNN\nMr look or should stop the hatred for a while but let's go back to your uh your point is that the only solution as a barbed wire barrier\nFor that's what I thought that was my theory funding science how can I can understand where you're coming from there and it's kind of getting a grant around with all the innocent people\nAbout which is on MSNBC what are the which is that I missed him is he going to do with it the anti American anti family anti got anti Christian women on MSNBC what are they going to do with it boy that felt good boy I felt good saying that I'm ... years what are all the ... on MSNBC the anti American\nAnti family anti God which is on MSN NBC men and women what are they going to do with this with with such a fence I don't know I'm going to send you a copy of stop mass hysteria maybe you can divert one person so reality in New York if you're calling from New York I don't even know\n[noise] well I'm open for business here I promise and other stuff we're only talking about the Caribbean what if you won the Powerball mega millions sixty one point six billion dollars how much would you actually pay\nWell mostly if you don't know that we'll make more than a certain amount of paid thirty seven percent of our income to the feds and then if we live in New York\nOr California we pay them a lot more New York has the highest state tax in the country and then California is running a close second about twelve to fourteen Fifteen Percent in the state on top of federal tax which used to be Dr both from federal income tax\nBut when Trump's tax plan in place we can no longer the duct our state income tax payments from a federal income and so therefore we're actually paying more taxes California did you know that no no this is this is a terrible reality\nSo that's the top income tax rate for individuals was thirty seven percent\nAnd that rate applies to adjusted gross income uh five hundred thousand or more so if you hit the jackpot you'll pay at least thirty seven percent and then state taxes depending upon the state you live in after all the gangs have to take their cut to\nYou know the gangs that are run the states need to take their ... how else can they buy their new brownies suits and they're five hundred dollar ties how can you buy a ... suit unless you're taking the money from the the ... or in the living\nSo how we got to stop this this ah Matt ... these vandals from getting into the country how well\nI guess I have to read a little history to you but you want a little tiny string about when Rome was broken into by the vandals individually guts when the barbarians in other words broke through Roman broke the nation and half would you like the little little history\nNow do you find it

they're all coming here to work why do you assume that in a mob of Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealers no right but no killers\nKnow gang members why would you assume that there'll be a logical\nAlleged both agree left all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand a small percentage are bad people very bad people of the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races so why would you want to bring in people like that to your country when we already have\nWhen Rome was broken into by the vandals individually guts when the barbarians in other words broke through Roman broke the nation and half would you like to be a little little history now do you find it offensive that I'm calling illegal aliens like this the army's this army of young men barbarians\nHow do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them why do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work why do you assume that in a mob a Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealers no right but you know killers\nAnd they'll gang members why would you assume that there'll be a logical so lead you both agree left all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand a small percentage are bad people very bad people\nOf the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races so why would you want to bring in people like that to your country when we already have a a crime wave in the country that's hardly control of all I Know we're not supposed to even talk about it but this terrible crime in this country especially if you are in the media and you read about these things\nThen you have to arrange walking the streets but I think it's important that you study for one second with me if you don't mind a little history I have a minute or two to do it with I Would do it and I'd say forty minutes by had a pod cast right now which is what you'll get come January I wouldn't cut it off but\nLet's go back to ancient Rome together and let's see what happened in the early history of Rome\nWhen the barbarians broke the empire into and how did that happen\nHow did it happen that the Romans couldn't defend their their borders which will call their frontiers how did it happen that they broke through\nWell it's just I told you the whole story ready they broke through what more do you need to know where I go to the whole story now you'll get bored I Know you're tuned out already in the age of Twitter and sound bites the minute I said history you went to sleep\nYou turned on either um the nail gun or a something\nThat's a little you know more soundbite and so how did the barbarians break the Roman empire enter into east and west where al ... as I describe and stop mass hysteria and as I described to you before on this program\nIt began and the third century of the Roman empire which was listening to very important for you to hear the ...\nThe empire and the third century was already decaying socially and disintegrating Marley wow does that sound like doesn't a gym doesn't sound like today at that time in Rome was already decaying socially and disintegrating merrily and then they face the barbarians\nOn their borders and guess what happened next well\nAll on the imperial frontier\nWhich ran roughly along the Rhine and then you enemies will now pressing against the Roman borders the Franks and other German tribes have come up to the right\nIn North Hungary where the vandals in what was once that see a and there's now Romania the visit God's or west Scott's behind those in South Russia where they each got ... or ...\nAnd beyond those in the vulgar region where the lands and then they were the Mongolian people's forcing their way towards Europe\nSo history is repeating itself

about it because he was aware that\nA stockpile of nuclear weapons that we have particularly on the air force with 'em for familiar with um are are all in dire need of replacements for example the

he asked the threatened war with Russia [noise]\nNow I'll tell you it's less certainly threaten the war with Russia was trying to do is try to call them on that if you have a slight advantage\nOr is there any evidence that we outsiders conceive would show that Russia has violated that Reagan Era agreement I don't know where that might might be [noise]\nThat I don't hold on the line\nThose were

things I say appear here and there because I think someone who's listening in the in a circle but I have no way to know that\nI don't believe I'm In the inner circle at all I think I'm On the outside right now because I don't believe this administration likes any criticism at all and I think that if I stepped out of line here I did so for the sake of the nation not for the sake of the party or the sake of the president's I care about the nation I put the nation above men do you know that\nI don't know why\nI say and what you're saying but you're thinking that I should go you think I should be a

send you a stop mass hysteria for being so intelligent\nNow before we we move on guard again if I had a park is I go for an hour right now I started something earlier in the show when I talked about the armies of invaders that are sitting on the border all these strapping young men and then I reference\nWhen the barbarians broke the Roman empire in the east and west and I talked about why that happened in the third century and the reason they were able to break the Roman empire and the third century is because the Roman empire at that time\nHad been decaying socially and disintegrating morally and then the barbarians of ... appeared on their borders now what's shocking in what I just said to you\nIs that no one listening to the show could disagree with me that this nation is not decaying socially and that's not the integrated morally or you got to do is look is look at the people in the media and you'll understand what I'm Talking about all you got to do is walk in San Francisco or New York where you see a man urinating on the subway track\nOr a bum dropping his pants and deprecating on the street that's what I mean by decaying socially then add to that the drug epidemic in the nation\nThen add to that the the moral disintegration of the nation and you'll understand why were collapsing as a nation\nAnd so who saved the Roman empire almost saved the Roman empire and that was Constantine the great he was uh\nSocially and disintegrating morally and then the barbarians of ... appeared on their borders now what's shocking and what I just said to you\nIs that no one listening to the show could disagree with me that this nation is not decaying socially and that's not disintegrated Marley all you got to do is look is look at the people in the media and you'll understand what I'm Talking about all you gotta do is walk in San Francisco or New York where you see a man urinating on a subway track\nOr a bum dropping his pants and deprecating on the street that's what I mean by decaying socially then add to that the drug epidemic in the nation\nAnd then add to that they the moral disintegration of the nation and you'll understand why were collapsing as a nation\nAnd so who saved the Roman empire almost saved the Roman empire\nAnd that was Constantine the great he was a monarch of great devotion and great intelligence by the way\nIn in some ways I Know you're not going to like to hear this Trump is like our Constantine the great\nI've made comparisons of Trump to pass historic figures\nAnd they've fallen on deaf ears because ... by the literary folk and the media don't want to hear anything good about Trump but I'm sure they're educated people out there understand what I'm saying when I say ... he was constantly in the great ... of great intelligence who did some great things\nAnd what happened was ... Constantine originally beat back a raid of the gods\nThe gods you know about dots well you know what I mean the gods with black makeup and San Francisco they beat Baca right of the gods\nWho are trying to come in from the Balkans but he didn't have the will or the power of the government behind him to protect the frontier across the down you why he was too busy\nHe was preoccupied with the weaknesses of the empire itself does that sound familiar so Trump is facing a similar situation of a week and empire from within and invasion from without you're following this\nIt's a very big story to take me a couple of hours to go into but I'll summarized it for you in a in a thumbnail sketch\nBecause what happened was\nCautioned team did the best they could but then he died trying to reorganize Rome and what happened right after he passed was the borders of Rome working ruptured and the visit God's invaded almost the Constantinople\nThey defeated the emperor of el ends at address on our poll they built a settlement in Bulgaria and from eighty seven three seven nine to three Ninety five there came the emperor you do see us the great and he was a ... a formidable ... emperor up\nAnd over the armies of Italy and ... presided still like you know he was a van dull\nAnd he presided over the armies and the Balkan Peninsula lark a God and I could go on and on and I don't want to go on and on just to give it some more history just to board your history has to bore me as a kid but the more I study these things I realized that America is repeating the history all over again in some ways\nWhich is a nation collapsing from within from social and moral decay as was ancient Rome and the nation being pressed on its borders by armies from without as we are seeing in ... in black and white and every color imaginable on our borders\nWere being pressed on our borders again\nAnd then what happened was after our lark marched into Italy and after a short sheets took Roman eighty four ten Rome fell apart and what happened after um collapse did life go on for the average Roman listened carefully the ...\nArmies and the Balkan Peninsula lark a God and I could go on and on and I don't want to go on and on just to give it some more history just to bore you are histories to bore me as a kid but the more I study these things I realized that America is repeating the history all over again in some ways\nWhich is a nation collapsing from within from social and moral decay as was ancient Rome and the nation being pressed on its borders by armies from without as we are seeing in ... in black and white and every color imaginable on our borders\nWere being crushed on our borders again\nAnd then what happened was after ... marched into Italy and after a short sheets took Roman eighty four ten Rome fell apart and what happened after um collapsed did life go on for the average Roman listened carefully\nThe opening half from the fifth century this was remember hundreds of years later\nYou saw the entire Roman Empire in Europe become prey to Robert armies of barbarians does that sound like gangs Bush is doing I guess that there's not an eerie as outrageous some history as the Roman emperor empire in Europe collapses in the fifth century\nRobber armies of barbarians were praying on the Romans citizen\nThink about that\nThinking about what you're seeing in America today where we as middle class citizens\nWe lock our doors we lock our cars we have alarm systems we carry guns many of us\nThink about this why you know you walk around a suburban neighborhood and look at every house they have an alarm system I'm not going into an ad every house has an alarm system every house is fortified like a little for\nBecause people realized that at night somebody could break in a while they're away at work paying the taxes for the illegal aliens to enjoy their lives someone could break in\nSo they protect themselves because right now we have the equivalent of rubber armies going around the country I Know it sounds rather hysterical but it is and it's out of the ... is rather accurate if you actually read the crime there was as I Do and look at the data as opposed to the fake data put out by the fake media\nBy those in the fake news business so\nI can tell you what went on in the life of the countryside half the room was invaded\nAnd what happened to the nation their roads and forest became infested with robbers\nThe barbarians went into the forest so stop right there you're in California the barbarians have almost destroyed our entire ecosystem\nThe barbarians who've been raising marijuana in the ... national forest these pristine beautiful ancient fires have almost been destroyed by drug drug cartels or raising marijuana\nNot only drug cartels we haven't digital criminals who have been destroying our ecosystem what's ironic to me as all these green left us who care so much about the environment have said nothing\nAs are sacred and ... streams and waterways have been destroyed with toxic chemicals by the marijuana growers in our very national forest not one word from Jerry Brown\nThink about it the man who spends all this time conniving to hate Trump\nConniving to bring in more illegal aliens\nSays nothing about the army's that have destroyed our ecosystems it on national forest in their quest to raise more crops\nUsing chemicals that are banned and outlawed everywhere in the world to speed the growth of these are plants and the waste is going into the stream and into the earth killing animals and destroying the ecosystem for many decades to come\nSo in many ways as I said to you history has it\nAnd what's ironic to me as all these green left is to care so much about the environment have said nothing as are sacred and pristine streams and waterways had been destroyed what toxic chemicals by the marijuana growers that are very national forest about one word from Jerry Brown\nThink about it the man who spends all his time conniving to hate Trump\nConniving to bring in more illegal aliens\nSays nothing about the army's that destroyed our ecosystems it on national forest in their quest to raise more crops\nUsing chemicals that are banned and outlawed everywhere in the world to speed the growth of these plants and the waste is going into the streams and into the earth killing animals and destroying the ecosystem for many decades to come\nSo in many ways as I said to you history has repeated itself history is repeating itself\nAnd as I Try to alarm America yes I Would use the word

guessed\nHer name is Don ... she's the founder and president of low this law maternity housing services\nMetropolitan area that's that's a pretty big nugget of a city it may be no Dallas but it's a pretty big city right mhm\nIt is lots of need from east to west right oh\nReally you know even the city even the state oh yeah\nAbsolutely and what I was driving up before when I was talking about the homes that I remember or have heard about mostly are\nIn static locations I think there's a uniqueness to your methodology that is a a a large\nNugget of genius and I want you to unpack that for the listeners so that\nThey can see that this is sort of a new approach and ingenious approach and then once that set up then I'll let you die right into what the program actually looks like because\nEventually we'll take a break in about ten minutes but before we finish the program we're going to make sure the listeners have a way to reach out directly\nTo help lotus loft\nAnd or helped perpetuate this good work so\nTell us about the model of you know not having necessarily a static location you're still working with\nDifferent location right absolutely so really the thought process behind that is that loaded flopped received several calls in a week and we really\nDesire to impact lied on such a level and so it's really a working partnership between ads in our resident\nBecause they have to desire that change as well and we work very hard at what we do but we also asked that she worked very hard at what she did you as well\nSo because of the great need that\nAnd as I have a way to reach out directly\nTo help lotus loft\nAnd uh her perpetuate this good work so\nTell us about the model of you know not having necessarily static location you're still working with\nDifferent location right absolutely so really the thought process behind that is that loaded swapped received several calls in a week and we really\nDesire to impact lives on such a level and so it's really a working partnership between us and our residents\nBecause they have to desire that change as well and we work very hard at what we do but we also adds that she worked very hard at what she it's to do as well\nSo because of the great need that you know it's across the valley that is across you know our state but even as far as I get calls from Albuquerque Detroit wow Marilyn taxes we'd how\nIndividual from those states so I mean it's really on a nationwide level and we cannot be limited to a certain amount of facing issue\nLike in a in a building for like you know the traditional\n... home run like maybe in a house you know if you have like five bedrooms and you have you know how mama at there and so that really opens the other four bedrooms up but Ninety percent of those that are coming to loaded flopped have our moms to prior born children\nNinety percent the average amount of children per mom that\nWe provide housing too it's three the Ninety percent of those coming to us have prior born children and then it's obviously she's pregnant and then the number of the children are three and so for people are ready just like that\nLike really directly right I mean you would fill up one place over not\nPretty much or how do you do it so what we do is we\nAre contracted through different facilities um by way of extending the housing\nSo different extended stay apartment style of facilities where they're fully furnished they're really nice they're really well put together there stays there have the landscaping and the you know the pools and all that good stuff so that way\nUm [noise] you know the children can continue growing with the mom we do not want to take away the memories of that family being together and that is really what\nAccents what we do I believe is that life just continues on they're not being if you will coddled that they're really being empowered\nTo be able to obviously stand on their own two feet but continue making memories you know mom there every evening cooking for her babies giving them by getting them in bed getting them up the next morning for school for daycare\nWhat have you but whenever she leads loaded flopped she would have had all of those months prior to really know what life look like and to be able to understand what that looks like as a family unit\nRight and I suppose I\nI think I was always excited about the model because if the interactive and if it's got so many more\nLife skills than just survival right because I think you've said this maybe at the top of the show but\nOne of the objectives is for these women and their families to thrive absolutely and in order to do that you need a little to some of this was vocational training right\nI mean some domestic vocational training\nI Know you guys do drugs\nThere every evening cooking for her babies giving them bad getting them in bed getting them up the next morning for school or for daycare\nWhat have you but whenever she leads loaded flopped she would have had all those months prior to really know what life look like and to be able to understand what that looks like as a family unit\nRight and I suppose I think I was always excited about the model because of the interactive and if it's got so many more\nLife skills than just survival right because I think you've said this maybe at the top of the show but\nOne of the objectives is for these women and their families to thrive absolutely and in order to do that you need a little some of this has vocational training right\nI mean some domestic vocational training\nI Know you guys do ... and things like that as well right absolutely\nWhere we really have established great community partners that really accent what we do by way of employment agencies I'm registered nurses that work with labor and delivery classes\nFinancial educators that really come alongside us and and really I'm instructing guide finances and what that looks like as far as even investing and you know the stock market and all that good jazz while but yeah I Know crazy right yeah um but even that we are also with uh\nThe city of Phoenix early head start program that gives our resident you know no costs daycare for up to three years oh wow so you know the kids are either school age and they're in school out all day or they go to daycare and they're very well cared for and loved\nBy the daycare facilities that were with\nFor the sake of argument is most of you have to well let me for Amos differently you find yourself traveling or do you have more people now helping in different locations\n'cause I remember originally yeah we're doing most everything yourself and this is kind of you're up to ... you know update every body of what's what's what's going on I mean I presume you're still traveling the whole valley right\nYes um we have had women who\nYou know half of our residents you know domestic violence and you know really there have been times fruits that we've had to you know\nSwitch a woman from you know the ... valley to the east and the matter of thirty minutes wow and to be able because of domestic violence and finding out where she is and yadda yadda yadda\nUm and so really it provides that flexibility to be able to relocate a downside upgrade you know it really give so much by way of just accepting accent teen what we do and I'm really allowing the program and these women to thrive\nSo John as it is like you've probably keep lots of great records but I mean just anecdotally from the top of your head or we survey more victims of domestic violence than we are the indigent or do you find that it's fifty fifty ... what are the numbers speaking to\nReally it would probably be fifty fifty but I Would probably say that the homelessness here especially within the valley is greater\nThan but it's it's a close call\nSo in interviewing the ladies and their children are we finding that family units are breaking down and these women are falling through the cracks or that they were previously married and divorced and just can't spend enough hours with their kids and work it moves\nAre we getting a sense of the causes of homelessness\nSo John as it is like you probably keep lots of great records but I mean just anecdotally from the top of your head or we survey more victims of domestic violence than we are the indigent or do you find that it's fifty fifty ... what are the numbers speaking to\nReally it would probably be fifty fifty but I Would probably say that the homelessness here especially within the valley is greater\nThan but it's it's a close call\nSo in interviewing the ladies and their children are we finding that family units are breaking down and these women are falling through the cracks or that they were previously married and divorced and just can't spend enough hours with their kids and work in ...\nAre we getting a sense of the causes of homelessness at all or\nIs it just a million different reasons\nIt really you know as we know there's just such a breakdown within our family today and\nSo many times just due to the children being L. where fathers cannot you know take the pressure of you know the medical bills or\nYou know what have you so he literally we've had this one family where he literally a fans and the family and and relocated to a different state\nUm but there is just such a breakdown within our within our family unit and I think that we're really seeing the effects of what that is within the context of what we do\nReally none of them have been married okay ah so it really isn't about that um but it's really also intriguing that once they these fathers learn at the ... of these women they they want to come back\nAnd they want to you know squeeze [laughter] you know in there and so\nWhen they find out that they're being accepted that there are being helped that they're being loved that they're being guided they they feel the need you know to to desires some of those finances or desire you know or whatever that may look like so that's that's really intriguing\nThat is and it's strange dynamic\nBut we'll talk more about that after the break we're running right into a break here at the bottom of the hour again if you just joined this is the Bruce Nixon show live the life of coffee studios here at seventh street and done mapping Phoenix if you happen to be in the area combined watched the last thirty minutes of the program\nWe'll be are enjoying the radio program whether you're in your car or at home listening perhaps on your\nMobile device or your home computer were in Studio again with Don ... the founder and president of lotus loft maternity housing services\nAre really stellar program I Hope you're enjoying it as much as I Am because this is one of the gems of the valley that a lot of people will be able to get behind and we're going to make sure you have lots of information before the end of the program\nA really stellar program I Hope you're enjoying it as much as I Am because this is one of the gems of the valley that a lot of people will be able to get behind and we're going to make sure you have lots of information or before the end of the program\nLaughing about that story because you're going to kill me but\nI think maybe that's what it was you never know\nWhat is H Q. like I mean you guys have big offices now or at home\n[noise] it really we tried to keep expenses as low as possible and so really it\nOut of a home based office since ... things like I Know what I'm saying I'm because we just really want to be able to instead of doing that being only Thirteen months old instead of\nDoing the housing and all of that could that are you know I Know what you mean they expensive that we really want to be able to put that behind a family\nAnd I was a set of question because I'm going to drive home for the listeners you know you can trust that this is\nRun as a tight ship some nonprofits\nGet accused of being Lucy goosey and spending money you know some people have said things like well you know if you\nDonate to the red cross only Thirteen cents on the dollar goes to aid\nAmusing as example don't hold me to that quote but you get my point right and so\nA year ago or more when we were talking about how you had created this plan I I think I did my best to hear from you in the genius of not having a home that you have to pay taxes on do maintenance on you know expend all this top heavy\nThing it's dead as a charity you could take every dollar donated\nPut it into the extended care facility they take care of the uh the water and living the maintenance yet they probably do the laundry that yet I mean the hotel laundry mhm\nThe personal laundry still probably dug a laundromat but you get my point all these other things are taking care of rather than wasting money not wasting money using money\nFor these other things do or wanted folks to be assured of that and we'll get to and just a moment how to get you some help directly what about a fleet of vehicles driving you know lotus lot buses now\nWe are\nSo grateful for a wonderful woman and her family who has\nDonated as than than eleven passenger van sweet I Know one of those white commercial type of van\nHad like a high top on it yeah\n[laughter] well we you know whenever that email kind of came through I was jumping up and down because we just had our standard you know little SUV and so we were making\nRather than wasting money not wasting money using money for these other things do or wanted folks to be assured of that and we'll get to and just a moment how to get you some help directly what about a fleet of vehicles driving you know lotus Blockbuster's now\nWe are\nSo grateful for a wonderful woman and her family who has\nDonated a van in eleven passenger van sweets I Know one of those white commercial type of van had like a high top on it yeah\n[laughter] so we you know whenever that email kind of came through I was jumping up and down because we just had our standard you know little SUV and so we were making\nStrip out your trip there you know get everyone to charge get everyone here get everyone there but now we can all kind of more or less pile and the van or\nYou know we need to make a few trips but it's it is it's been a blessing\nAll right so you've got the big van which is awesome blessed we get to and from what about how many volunteers are working with you these days about four okay\nThat number's up that\nIs [laughter] yeah that is\nWhat rules do they play [noise]\nI'm really because we uh\nReally the mamas are\nThe date today you know a lot of other maternity housing program to offer them you know they need volunteers that come in and you know do this or that or maintenance or wash dishes or help cook really we don't really have any of that because really everyone has their own space and so the mama during their\nOwn room with their own you know kitchenette cooking up a storm for their kids do we really don't have that what we really have found that we really need it just\nExperience we need these women inspired we need these women really hot and we need them guided so we utilize volunteers that will come and share their stories that will come and plant seeds\nAnd will come and just really\nUm be there in less than you know we have every Thursday night we have um general sessions\nAnd it's really a time to give these women of weight because they need to know that they're hurt they need to know that they're understood and it's really a a\nVery much a family bonding kind of scenario and so different volunteers will come in and you know it's sometimes can you know turn into a gripe session sometimes you know about men or that that are that that are going to measure\nThat happening yeah yeah [laughter]\nSo um but it really it's really been impactful for to have on here see that\nSo I may put another way their life coaching they're mentoring young they're being you know an older sister yeah I mean all those things grandmother super positive yet diaper changers yeah\nOr the more ... facts I mean how do we see these good people who have got a\nThrough a\nGrocery store buying okay I Know that I never you know I only ask because they're the need is so great\nRight I mean I mean it's huge right because it's very you have the coordinates not just the\nWhere but the house\nRight I mean they need food everyday write a mom this or to have at least one child but you're saying the average three we're talking you know ... bacon eggs you know whatever there is a lot of neat right and who do go by\nPacked full for to have on a chair see that\nSo I may put another way their life coaching they're ... they're being you know an older sister yeah I mean all those things grandmother super positive ... diaper changers yeah\nAll right some more brass tacks I mean how do we see these good people have got as\nThrough a\nGrocery store buying okay I Know that you know I I only ask because they're the need is so great\nRight I mean I mean it's huge right because it's very you have to coordinate\nNot just the where but the house right I mean they need food everyday write a mom that's already have at least one child but you're saying the average three we're talking you know hot cereals cold cereals bacon eggs you know whatever there is a lot of neat rank\nAnd who does all that there was a volunteer coordinator food do you coordinate all that food how to get done\nReally because they're they have their own state thing they the moms really kind of coordinate thoroughly so you give them a little stipend mhm a little get basic assistance will recall in the military to be a key you get a little a\nBasic assistance or\nThat's very good so you put them a little budget yet taken to the banks set up a little checking account of and get them a debit card and saving yet\nWow yet because\nBruce Ware work based program right 'cause they're working there working ...\n... okay it to a point where\nYou are they haven't yet\nTotally but they don't know what you're saying they have to participate in the program yeah absolutely right I mean if they go for some reason obviously you're still\nGoing to help 'em or understand that but yeah we have to you know they're pregnant so there's a whole bunch of different scenarios kind of going on and there's a lot of grace given obviously we understand that a lot of pickles a lot of ice cream you know or just a lot of need to you know\nKind of maybe relaxed that they are not be on her feet or you know what I'm saying\nI Do and I ... I'm driving at that it's only because I wanted to get that sense or the volunteers are yourself more involved at that point like well somebody come in and you\nLook for them yes we've had that you know how to do that because a lot lots of ... and the sense\nOf stewardship you know there's a lot going on especially because\nYou know in the first couple of weeks I Can't even imagine not being just a huge crisis of trying to be organized right having gone from a domestic violence or homeless situation\nThere's a lot of catching up to do mhm right right All right so we've got food assistance the moms once they get on their feet are working what about cars\nReally a lot of them can save\nFor a vehicle okay and\nWe'll have the finances because of employment should be able to go to one of our partners and being able to purchase a vehicle\nHas died so for instance all of our moms right now they're having their own vehicle wow I we are super duper alright and we're like a dealership

a barrier in Mexico\nWe're not talking about a structure\nWe're talking about the Mexican government\nPutting a patrol cars tanks whatever they need to do and build a natural barrier and funneled or people into that natural ... and not let them go forward that's what has to happen but Mexico doesn't want to do it for two reasons they don't want them there\nThey have their own internal problems they can't afford to take care of them nor can wait\nWell is a ... a thought that's a little troubling it doesn't really matter what Trump does if he says the military to the border the vermin and the

really matter at this stage in my career who represent often at the end of the day as long as my ideas or thoughts about I'm really happy so they ripped off the word hysteria but try to create hysteria but I put together three words stop mass hysteria\nAnd then for a while you heard the words hysteria being used and they realize they might be helping me so they stopped so everyone's trying to come up with a new word for hysteria they don't know what to do with that so now there's a new idea that I've come up with I have an idea Smith and should Trump threatened withdraw from the new NAFTA Mexico failed to stop the Amish it makes sense to me it's a good strategy\nIf I were in Donald Trump's kitchen cabinet\nHaving a Diet Coke and an ice cream with him\nI Would suggest the same thing\n... he's such an intuitively intelligent man and a man of action they say you know that's a good idea let's do it that's how we would work\nHe would work like see if I was with it but I'm not

I don't know that anything I say is being heard that was the last straw I mean once they put cocky in there it was all over\nCan you take people from one network and use them in your administer I should exclusively did Obama ever do anything like that\nYou don't remember anything a very sensitive issue right now in the middle of all of this is not even personal it's worrisome to me what if Obama had hired the former director of I don't know CNN let's say let's take seeing a lot of we woke up and said oh she Obama's\nTalking to a Wolf Blitzer every night twice a light on telephone\nAnd Wolf Blitzer is the only one advise them\nIf this went on for years let's say a whole year no or then the the guy who was fired from CNN ... imaginary uh guys fired from CNN has no job for the next thing you know he's communications director for Obama tell me what tongues would be wagging on the conservative side like all\nSo how could you know what I'm saying you can't be blind to what the other side is seeing if you are then you're going to lose and this is what's worrisome to me is I think that not only we we the core base of this whole thing\nWe the people the core base of the whole thing I think we've become blind to the other side we may think we know what they think but I don't think we do and then if were blind to what they're saying about us them were really in trouble\nThat's why I have to be the independence I am and that's why I sometimes a great many of your people who wear the hats\nForwards or backwards it upside down even on Sundays because you don't understand what it means to be an independent commentator in this country because so few of us exist\nThere are others here and there but I Am an independent so what does that mean it means I have to be critical times even of the man that I admire so much and who I back it's that simple\nIf you have a family member who you think is making a mistake socially or economically or in business and you say wait a minute that's not a good idea\nJohnny can't do that because here's what's happened that's family isn't it family don't families disagree with each other\nWhereas this blind loyalty this

call them Calistoga wagons but the ... just circled and all of us wearing hats after stand in the middle\nAnd we have to wait for the flaming arrows flying over the tops of the wagons\nI don't see the world that way I don't quite see it in those terms and I still think it's good to have a dialogue with your opponents otherwise you'll get increasing tension anger\nAnd it's actually a very American idea [laughter]\nFree thinking and vigorous debate goes all the way back to the founding fathers it goes back to the constitution of the bill of rights\nFree thinking and vigorous debate but seems to have gone out the window\nRight now people are circling the wagons it's like wait a minute don't you dare talk to the Indians you know what I'm saying that's what has come down to stay here stay or in

otherwise\nYou'll get increasing tension anger and rage hatred hostility leading to a total of breakdown of the society which is the last thing we need bravo Michael thank you very much I just deported for myself and my own head because that's what we need to hear more about we didn't have more people saying what I just said\nLike give peace a chance you know what I'm saying like let's play a little beetles music together\nGive peace a chance let\nCertainly listen to the other side\nNot the ones who are pushing and shoving\nHit them back harder as my position see I say if we go low and they kick us kick them even harder kick them into the gutter it's that simple we go low they take us and I got to kick them how to take them into the gutter that's number one but if there are people who wanna rationally discussion discuss things that's what I'm saying we should do\nAnd I would hope that the other side still has some rational people on it who are willing to hear our point of view such as let me ask you something missed the liberal from San Francisco\nAre you telling me you really want another twenty thousand or so mainly young men strapping strong young men from the Central America that come into this country right now do you think that would actually say yes\nYou think that the city of San Francisco so liberal you'd be mistaken if you actually spoke to many of the middle class working people I mean professionals they may have money there may have property new cars families you think they really don't know what's being done in the city you think they like stepping over human trash\nYou think that they like seeing the windows were broken out on their cars when they go to a restaurant you think they like seeing them is managing the point the buildings are falling over because of the corruption in the construction industry here or that Venice avenue is so broken up through the contract corruption that stores are going out of business you think they don't say this\nThey don't see if they do see it\nAnd they say to me with a few times I run into and talk to him as I can say anything because most of my customers are liberals or they wouldn't patronize they'd be quite surprised to find out how many people think just the way they do\nAnd no none of them want the illegals here\nNone of them want another army of illegal aliens in this country on screen on vetted some of whom are very dangerous some of whom may be disease\nAnd certainly the social service systems which are already overwhelmed cannot support these people in any way so don't tell me that all these good Democrats in good oh San Francisco want more of them that would be a complete and total lie\nBut having said all of that it's now time for me to listen to you\nSo I'm going to open up to one or two calls here on the Savage Nation\nRemember my solution I didn't say forced to stop the roads\nBecause ah I have a bit of the Confucius I'm a bit of Confucius is gene pool Emmy which is why I eat a lot of Chinese food is the feed the Confucius within and the Confucius within said we can stop this\nThe illegals here none of them want another army of illegal aliens in this country an screens on vetted some of whom are very dangerous some of whom may be disease\nAnd certainly the social service systems which already overwhelmed cannot support these people in any way so don't tell me that all these good Democrats in good old San Francisco want more of them that would be a complete and total lie\nBut having said all of that it's now time for me to listen to you\nSo I'm going to open up to one or two calls here on the Savage Nation\nRemember my solution I didn't say forced to stop the roads\nBecause a ... a bit of the\nConfucius I'm a bit of Confucius is gene pool let me which is why I eat a lot of Chinese food is the feed the Confucius within and the Confucius within said we can stop this invasion from Central America without firing a shot\nWithout even launching a troop I Want you to think I I Want you to think about this the last two or alive he would have me as an advisor\nDonald Trump should absolutely understand he needs to reach out from behind his TV circle of advisors he needs to reach beyond that little world of people talking to each other every day with the same stories in the same mindset and the same pack phrase is\nHe needs to reach out to the western regions of this great empire of his and he needs to speak\nTo the leaning intellectual on the west coast who is a supporter of his eye has always been and will be and understand that I just said Trump can stop this invasion without lifting a finger and firing a shot always got to do is lift the phone I'll be right back\n...

know our Twitter pulled tonight has to do this do you believe Saudi Arabia's excuse\nOf a tremendous mistake for the death of Jim all his show gave\nYou remember the the so called journalist also apparently a political activist or Saudi Arabia's foreign minister says the death of ... at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul, Turkey was a tremendous mistake that's the quote\nAnd part of a robot operation adding that his government would punish those responsible for his murder\nThe individuals who did this did it outside the scope of their authority they're obviously was a tremendous mistake made and what compounded the mistake was the attempt to try to cover it up\nThat is unacceptable in any government Saudi Arabia is already taking action to investigate how could show you died and hold those responsible accountable we are determined to uncover every stone you know I just had this thought\nThat if you say Saudi Arabia is not to believe then I look they have acted like one of our allies in the region but I haven't been happy with many of the things that the Saudi Government has done but if you say this couldn't possibly have been any kind of rogue operation\nI Want you to just cast your mind back\nTo a time when the United states had quite a presence in Iraq\nAnd we had a a prison there called Abu grade and on the night shift a whole pack a net which\nWho were in the United states military but clearly I think they'd been assigned to the night shift because they weren't very good service members and what they decided to do was pull a bunch of stunts\nThey did some things to the prisoners there that brought a lot of shame on the United states of America\nAnd it was not known to their superiors\nOr against a few of them knew about it and they were cashiered it was certainly not known to the president of the time George W. Bush and yet our government said hey they shouldn't have happened it was a rogue operation\nThe people who did it are being held responsible and that's where we end it so if it's a little tough for us to be the pot calling the kettle black saying well we never have rogue operations in our government and if you want a more recent example\nHow about this for an example Mexico has had a drug war that has been going on for a long time it is literally taken the lives of hundreds of\nThousands of Mexican citizens and at least a few American citizens as well during that drug war and during the long eight years of the Obama administration\nThe Obama department of justice and twenty five hundred firearms into Mexico\nIt was certainly not known to the president at the time George W. Bush and yet our government said hey they shouldn't have happened it was a rogue operation\nThe people who did it are being held responsible and that's where we end it so if it's a little tough for us to be the pot calling the kettle black saying well we never have rogue operations in our government and if you want a more recent example\nHow about this for an example Mexico has had a drug war that has been going on for a long time it is literally taken the lives of hundreds of\nThousands of Mexican citizens and at least a few American citizens as well during that drug war and during the long eight years of the Obama administration\nThe Obama department of justice sent twenty five hundred firearms into Mexico at a time when they knew that the guns were going into the hands of some of the drug cartels\nAnd they have identified over the years at least four hundred Mexican nationals who died having been shot with guns that came from the Obama the OJ\nIncluding Brian Terry in American border agent who was also shot with one of those guns you remember when some of us conservatives said hey if Obama's de OJ sent the guns into Mexico and people were killed with them Obama should be held responsible\nAnd Brian Terry died because he was shot with a gun that was part of the fast and furious gun running operation into Mexico Obama at the very least Eric Holder the former attorney general they should be held responsible\nIt's a little bit hypocritical to say oh no no no you can't hold Eric Holder and Brock Obama responsible for what happened when one of the offices of the neo Jay in Arizona decided that it would send guns into Mexico that's not on the president's watch that's not because of the attorney general at that time\nThe Obama era you'll remember president who talked about containing ISIS or limiting ISIS or controlling where they could go and sort of geographically a boxing them in a Donald Trump campaign does a president who would wipe out guy says that destroyed them uh and and take them out of power\nObviously not every person who identified with ISIS has gone to this point but ISIS is I guess more gun than we ever thought it would be under ... Brock Obama\nA rich noises is senior editor for news busters rich why use the media keeping Donald Trump's defeat of ISIS in Syria and Iraq like it's a deep dark secret but they knew ... need not tell the public about\nWell it's one of the one of the white spots of this presidency I mean you know if you if you look at the evening news you get in on reluctantly negative story about this president most\nYou'll remember president who talked about containing ISIS or limiting ISIS or controlling where they could go and sort of geographically a boxing them in a Donald Trump campaign does a president who would wipe out ISIS that destroyed them uh and and take them out of power\nObviously not every person who identified with ISIS has gone to this point\nBut ISIS is I guess more gun than we ever thought it would be under a bronco Obama a rich noises and senior editor for news busters rich why use the media keeping Donald Trump's defeat of ISIS in Syria and Iraq like it's a deep dark secret that they knew ... need not tell the public about\nWell it's one of the one of the bright spots of this presidency I mean you know if you if you look at the evening news you get an unrelenting Lee negative story about this president mostly about the things he tweets\nThe things he says a sort of the soap opera aspects of all of this if you look at the record you know the economy\nIs very good job growth is very strong unemployed is at a record low and and foreign policy you have ISIS which was headquartered in Iraq and Syria had taken over key cities virtually extinguished in those areas the economy\nA portion of this we did a study earlier in the month I think that was less than one tenth of one percent of his coverage over the last four months and this we looked at it for the whole presidency\nThirty three minutes of coverage of the president's leadership in the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria out of over ten thousand minutes of evening news coverage that his point three three percent it is a positive story but the media are choosing to focus on other things where they can be negative\nIs there anybody can sort of called them out on this because Richard when I was a you know before it became a talk show host I was a reporter and you always look to to best the competition that is that the competition told a story you at least told the same story and tried to get them one be further down the road in a story\nAnd it and you always tried to find the story that nobody else was telling using their anybody in the fake stream media that's willing to break from the pack\nAnd say you guys aren't telling the story but it's a great story and and then contrast it back to some of the comments of a bomb I still remember when he sat down for an interview with somebody from ABC News and he was explaining very carefully why it was so hard to hit ISIS where they lived in rock or because it was tough\nTo to get to the target and you know do you explain all the difficulties and about three days later the French for goodness sake went in and bomb the daylights out of Raqqa\nAnd I don't remember running the soundbite able bomber explaining how hard it was to get to them and say\nYou know when the French military God Bless them can out do the United states or what the United States president things is capable it really doesn't say good things about your about your capabilities does it\nRight and that's exactly right and I would say one of the it's got extremely little grudging coverage but one of the big differences is President Trump chose a policy early on where he de centralized the authority to their commanders in the field you decide what to bomb we're not going to strangle it up and washing the way it was during the Obama administration\nAnd that has helped the or the generals in the field get the success that they have that was you know there was there's been a couple of stories at the very end of twenty Seventeen a listing this is one of the bright spots Hans Nichols did a story for NBC\nBut it it really has been\nYou know pushed out of the headlines you know the war is I mean that the Trump part of it is about thirty three minutes the entire a war against Iraq against ISIS in Iraq and Syria including what the Iraqis are doing what other allies are doing the whole state of at a hundred and fifty seven minutes\nExactly right and I would say one of the it's gotten extremely little grudging coverage but one of the big differences is President Trump chose a policy early on where he de centralized the authority to their commanders in the field you decide what to bomb we're not going to strangle it up and washing the way it was during the Obama administration\nAnd that has helped the or the generals

against ISIS in Iraq and Syria including what the Iraqis are doing what other allies are doing the whole state of at a hundred\nAnd fifty seven minutes of evening news coverage in almost two years this is a this is a very very small percentage of the news coverage they're acting as this thing\nIs a big story even if you were talking about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen this was seen as a major problem for the Obama administration now that it's not a problem\nUh thanks to a in part President Trump and his leadership and his administration they don't want to talk about it I think you know if if they're going to be unfair to the guy and badger him over things they should at least be fair and sometimes and and cover the things that are going up pretty well the the record is better than people generally know that it is\nWell and I guess let me make this comparison when Katrina\nHappen and it was seen as a as a big you know food bar for the Bush administration uh and and the media seemed to love to go back and do follow\nUp stories and say well remember when Katrina was handled so badly will here's how they're doing now I understand that most news is about things that do happen and then it's harder to\nCover the house that didn't burn down or the bad thing that didn't happen so they could say well now that ISIS isn't doing as much we're not covering things they're not doing\nBut to some extent what they're not doing is the story but if you wanted to do a story you could go to those regions and said this was a region that used to be dominated by ISIS with all the bad effects that would have\nOn the local populations and everything else and this is what's going on there now because the Trump Administration has pulled off what Morocco Obama\nHad declared to be impossible just a couple of years before and that story is completely doable and there's actually a very good story and the and the media does love to do sort of the good news stories you know you set up a new program to make this happen and look it's happening and you do the happy story that\nThat whatever it was you intend to the program and then you have the alternative programs that were set up to do some good and they didn't do any good but they spend a lot of money and you do that story as well\nThey could do any of those stories right now but I think they're making editorial choices not to because they don't want to make Trump look good\nAnd I think you're right I think I mean CBS has done is put a little more resources into this and the other two than NBC or ABC\nAnd I believe they had their correspondence walking in the city of Raqqa in Syria which was the headquarters of ISIS or they can go there now and walk around and talk to the people who live there and his regime I mean that is a very compelling story we got a little little sliver of it uh\nBut you know given the importance of was to to the United states you think we'll be hearing a lot more about it not a lot less\nI Would think so too are there other good examples you run into where the mainstream media is avoiding telling me good store I just heard today that we're looking to maybe finish out the fourth quarter of this you're economically at four\nPercent GDP and yet I have yet to see a mainstream news organization New York times or Washington Post the New York times and it pays the salary of ...\nI think you're right I think I mean CBS has done is put a little more resources into this and the other two than NBC or ABC\nAnd I believe they had their correspondents walking in the city of Raqqa in Syria which was the headquarters of ISIS or they can go there now and walk around and talk to people who live there and his regime I mean that is a very compelling story we got a little little sliver of it uh\nBut you know given the importance it was to to ah the United states you'd think we'll be hearing a lot more about it not a lot less\nI Would think so too are there other good examples you run into where the mainstream media is avoiding telling me good store I just heard today that we're looking to maybe finish\nOut the fourth quarter of this recon automatically at four percent GDP and yet I have yet to see a mainstream\nNews organization New York times the Washington Post the New York times and it pays the salary of Paul Krugman who had declared that anything passed a two percent growth rate simply was not possible and now we may finished shot this year with the for the\nFourth quarter and the four percent range and I would think that any reporter worth his or her salt would say this was declared impossible with a couple of years ago and now it's now it's happening but again that would require the old grey lady the New York times to actually say\nTrump is sold off the impossible which I think they are getting tired of writing these days\nYeah there's been incredibly little coverage of that as well I mean looking at you know the tax cuts are in particular are given um\nA lot of coverage and negative coverage when they were being debated well right after they took effect you saw those companies giving a big bonuses to people you saw you've seen companies with higher growth that's led to or not got today or other up in the last couple of days but\nBig gains on Wall street uh and it's led to that economic boom so has the deregulation campaign those have gotten just a a few minutes of coverage in this vast sea of a negative news this year or it's one of the unsung success stories that I think needs to be told\nHey rich last thirty seconds what's gonna happen when this caravan reaches the border which I think they'll do before election day how are they going to ... how are they going to cash this one depending on what happens when those those are you know illegal aliens is what they are getting to the border\nWell they're already you know you've got I think every network now has people embedded in this caravan painting painting it is extremely sympathetically what they won't answer was the question of what gives them the right to come in um uh to the United states where they you know didn't file paperwork or anything like that um I think they'll they'll\nDo this like they did the uh cover the way they did the immigration detentions in the summer which is that it's a horrible things to covered ministry she's doing to sympathetic people and not a not so much to look at the rule of law and what that requires of president\nOf any party to do I think you're bound ride rich thanks very much we appreciate your time rich noise is a senior editor for news masters and we always appreciate his insights coming back the leftist media painting the immigrant ... immigrant caravan as victims of persecution what does that isn't that real\nLaw Larson show\n[noise]\n\n\n\nPainting the immigrant ... immigrant caravan as victims of persecution what does that is that real\nLaw Larson show\n\n\n\n\nYou know you are getting closer\nTo putting us in a position where we're going to have to cut you off but when you talk about freezing bank account who's bank account would you like to freeze and what would be your legal or what's the legal reason because you know you've got a bank account I've got a bank account the government can't come in and freeze your bank account without some legal authority\nAnd I know a lot of us suspect that there is money that is flowing\nTo this group through a bunch of cut outs that are probably so thorough I told one of my producers he said well how could that happen I said well let's say George Soros who a lot of us suspect so he's got the tides foundation a private nonprofit\nFoundation he'd tell somebody at the tides foundation has already sent money to say some do good or groups in Honduras Guatemala El Salvador and Mexico and what what do they do with it day by soccer balls for kids and they buy meals for poor people whatever they do with that\nThey've got money that's already in Mexico\nAnd so one of those groups is gets the word go and take some of the money out and help fund this caravan\nHow do you stop that most of it is likely happening not inside our borders and not in banks that we have anything to do it so it's easy to say shut them down to freeze the account\nBut what mechanism do you use to tell a private nonprofit non governmental organization an NGO in Mexico that has money to help the poor\nThat they can't take money out of their bank account and go down and buy meals for some of the seven thousand\nAmerican companies that are affiliated with a horse that yeah it wasn't any other on your hand or to\nFord would reasonably say what the heck does our plant making wiring harnesses for Ford escapes have to do or whatever it is they're making down there what does that have to do this ...\nAt the time\nWord go and take some of the money out and help fund this caravan\nHow do you stop that most of it is likely happening not inside our borders and not in banks that we have anything to do it so how is it easy to say shut them down freeze the account\nBut what mechanism do you use to tell a private nonprofit non governmental organization and NGO in Mexico that has money to help the poor\nThat they can't take money out of their bank account and go down in by meals for some of the anti American seven thousand\nAmerican companies that are affiliated out there the horse that yeah it wasn't any other\nOn your hand or to Ford would reasonably say what the heck does our plant making wiring harnesses for Ford escapes have to do or whatever it is they're making down there what does that have to do this ...\nAt the time or they are so it is\nNo no no no because what you're talking about his year lashing out and saying well let's just heard some American companies and say you could stop the how was Ford Motor company supposed to stop the caravan\nThe filing that's going to be in the country the way that they're gonna lose business they're going to lose ...\nYou're just gonna you're gonna pointed financial gun if anybody's had who's within sight or connect to America\nAnd you're going to say where make this happen or else well the Mexican government can say Ford Motor company can't tell us what to do the Mexican authorities have the power\nTo do something about this caravan they could simply say we're not going to allow this big group of people to do this but I don't see how you start then lashing out at every American Company saying you're down there so therefore you're part of the problem\nFor a week that's only for the last three days four days so finally woke up and they realize that we're serious the all shut down the last three or four or five days I sent them earlier\nI think the president's threat to Mexico is serious and I think he'll probably ... through ... through ... public announcements before then but when you just say start attacking American companies that do back in business in Mexico\nIt'd be like telling companies that do business you know some other foreign company like Germany Germany does something we don't like\nTo watch all of us are shooting earlier that the line was ain't got no\nNo I'll tell you what the US government and the military is very good at guarding borders\nWe guard borders as we pointed out last night in Afghanistan we've guarded borders in Iraq we've ... and I think that the United states military is very good at guarding borders\nThey're very good at concertina wire and as far as I'm concerned put a bunch of that on the border and beef up customs and border protection the border patrol and say to them look nobody's coming across this line\nAnd to to some extent\nWe're in a good spot now because if they try to come across in one big massive group there'll be a lot easier to deal with what I Wonder is as they get close to the border\nAre they going to start to spread out I mean if there's one big giant caravan you can probably stop that from coming across the border but if they split up and they started heading for fifty different spots on the U.S border the parts that don't have wall\nAnd don't have a lot of patrols it's going to become very difficult to do that blood or I'm not\nDisagreeing that we need to do something I'm just suggesting that those things like attacking American companies that do business in Mexico who can reasonably say we have nothing to do with this let's go to Stan Stan welcome to Lars Larson show\nHey there's a large thanks for having me back so I think both of you guys are wanting to have the leverage against Mexico to kind of forced to hand here and I think we do don't we well we do but I don't think the trade agreement is the thing I think there's something\nOr are they going to start to spread out I mean if there's one big giant caravan you can probably stop that from coming across the border but if they split up and they started heading for fifty different spots\nOn the U.S border the parts that don't have wall and don't have a lot of patrols it's going to be coming very difficult to do that blood or I'm not\nDisagreeing that we need to do something I'm just suggesting that those things like um attacking American companies that do business in Mexico who can reasonably say\nWe have nothing to do with this let's go to Stan Stan welcome to Lars Larson show\nHave a large thanks for having me back\nSo I think both of you guys are wanting to have the leverage against Mexico to kind of forced to hand here and I think we do don't we\nWell we do but I don't think the trade agreement is the thing I think there's something else we can do a ... that might be more effective I think we should post I mean obviously like your guest your other guest said the the ... the army should already be deployed along the border as a warning but\nI think we should post warships also founder and Ecuador and have them pressure Mexico and to returning the law\nNot a bad idea but again then you're going to have the world and I think is what the Democrats won in the world saying\nBig huge United States superpower\nMilitary is going to postage warships off of a couple of poor countries and threaten them\nThat's

states and working for a powerful media outlet owned by a liberal like Jeff Bezos Washington Post certainly didn't hurt\nBut do I believe they're excuse no no I don't believe it\nI think we need to get more information about what happened there do I believe that it was rogue elements within the Saudi Government\nWell after all we've seen a certain number of rogue elements within our own

Gita journalists a murder that he Turkey's gives\nThat on car enormous leverage over a and B. S. and I think what we're seeing is that our dog is trying to put pressure on the U.S administration to distance himself from everywhere from the ... leadership on this particular issue\nTo your news crews did Saudi Arabia have anything to gain by murdering ... per show\nI mean it used to do also of course it's something that we live in a democracy here and there was such a such an action it's housing saying had magical ah he's and I don't know why the Saudis would even take this move\nBut it looks like a this particular journalist was highly critical of the Saudi monarchy and looking into his prize in Turkey over the last few years it seems like he was getting closer to the Turkish leader sure if that's also I'm\nSupporting I don't want to teach\nMe I don't want to give us too much credit because he was effectively endorsing and support saying that the Muslim Brotherhood and ... and they evolved as to who was all the problems they they do want to for democratically governs\nThe middle east just a little bit but it's also a very hard to not look because we have to understand that the Democratic pretensions ideas on this when we see some of the monarchy ... popularly elected Islamist government's point of view\n... sure if he was on that turkey side a lot of the fight\nI mean of course they're going to war and so the Saudis taking any kind of action like this especially from our freedom for journalists a free press a point of view but it looks\nLike they wanted to eliminate that especially crown prince and the effort to eliminate this uh important force that he saw in ... he was up to remind our audience a columnist for the Washington\nPost which is a pretty influential if you think about it\nAnd I think they want us to eliminate this and um we bought the way and yes has done really against his internal enemies are inside Saudi Arabia as well so I think because of the line with his actions and and at the end the crown prince ... leadership style or the um to give enough credit\nDoes that mean that they would have done this thinking we can do this without anyone finding out\nI mean of course they're going to war and so that's how it is taking any kind of action like this especially from a freedom for journalists at the press a point of view but it looks\nLike a month to eliminate the especially proud pens and the effort to eliminate this uh important force that he saw industry and I he was up to remind our audience as a columnist for the Washington\nPost which is it pretty influential if you think about it\nAnd I think they want to say the money based on a move by the way and yes has done really against internal enemies are inside Saudi Arabia as well so I think is lined with action than at the end the cross country leadership style or the um they have to give him credit\nBut does that mean that they would have done this thinking we can do this without anyone finding out because they had to know that there would be some blowback\nIf they murdered a journalist who was tied to the Washington Post at the United states would be called upon to respond as I understand in Turkey locks of journalists all the time uh and and I would imagine that there are probably people locked up in Saudi Arabia\nFor a for going past the rules in that country as well and you had those don't cause international incidents but most of them don't involve people or or green card residents of the United states\nYes exactly and um and even you also know that the journalists had a good connection with us ah ah and I'm guessing that you shouldn't be on the just the Washington Post I think it's fair to say that he he is getting more than a journalist\nPerhaps even an activist I was looking out for U.S interests and I think the hell of a you know a hype the problem but also trust he has a lot of these here and the fact that it has this leverage\nI don't have a parade hits has quite to out here and the house by by hiking up the issue in the last few weeks turkey has been steadily\nLeaking information day by day and thereby ensuring that this issue kicks dominating headlines globally\nAnd ... bought one of the things I understand the paper that had originally claimed in Turkey that they had the audio recording of cush job she's dead now says well maybe we don't have the recording so some of the information that was pushed out early\nTo try to get a lot of attention to this that you have this murder happened inside the Saudi embassy that there was audio tape of it that you know it sounded horrific and then we find out that certain bits and pieces that were pushed out early to get everybody amped up about this story don't exist\nYeah man or a ... yeah well that the problem is nobody is really just have tried it and that's what President Trump has been saying that she wants to see the evidence that\nThe Turks cleaning the house\nThat particular newspaper that you mentioned media glad you did mention that because it is very much owned by the Turkish government it's affected the I don't propaganda machine and I don't even go as far as to say that that newspaper as long as the largest source of the nation leaving turkey um\nYeah and it only carry the messages that are pushed by the Turkish government so it's a highly problematic but\nThe only source of information that we have on this particular murder and the higher ordeal surrounding it is just coming from the Turkish side I wouldn't look at these\nNewspapers or even a some forces coming from the Turkish government as credible it's very important that as the United nations have called for that we need to have some more transparency so I Would like to see all those forces cooperating with the Turks are scenery you can't really trust that in front of\nTo hear a loop I got thirty seconds what's the right thing for the United states to do because one of our best asset too\nFind it said that we have very good source of the nation in Turkey I'm Carrying the messages that are pushed by the Turkish government it's a highly problematic\nOnly source for nation that we have on the market and the surrounding it it's just coming from the Turkish side I look at\nThese papers or even a couple of forces Turkish government that's credible it's very important that as the United nations has called for that you need to have some parents don't have any other sports cooperating with the chocolate in front of\nYour news to hear a loop I got thirty seconds what's the right thing for the United states to do because one of our best assets you in that region in Saudi and there aren't any good replacement what should the United states do at this point\nYeah right it's it's not like these are important right now especially with the patients that are about to come again on Iran\nCooperation with Saudi Arabia we heard secretary of state Mike Pompeo today hey that's all I'm Saudi officials in like ... like it's a ... could be a good night he\nChildren just being trafficked into the United states for all kinds of really ugly and heinous reasons I mean some of this is just\nA a lot of this problem that's being shoved onto the United states is demonstrably dangerous for the kids were you know who are who are the victims of this although I notice that most of the video that it's being shot at his group seems to be largely\nYou know twenty something male capable and I've seen some interviews with these people saying oh yeah we're workers will come and work hard well that's not the point if you're trying to escape persecution that would justify refugee or asylum status that's not just people saying I'd like a better job at a better rate of pay\nThat's not going to justify status on the border is it\nThat's exactly right so this is this comes back to the issue of the core issue here and that is\nRight now we've got a problem in our asylum process are sound system and we've got loopholes in our laws as you point out especially with children that's making it difficult for us to enforce our laws um right now\nYou've seen a spike in families at the border since the end of the zero tolerance policy I think it's been like Seventy five percent increase I'd say a couple of months yup\nAnd so now everyone knows if you want to get into the United states bring a child as you point out it doesn't even have to be your child just grandchild through and as long as you can hold that Keith together\nFor a little while that sure it together for a little while you get three right now and and I and our immigration courts are those things to seems and because of this loophole we simply cannot remove them fast enough\nHey that's not going to justify status on the border is\nThat's exactly right so this is this comes back to the issue of the core issue here and that is\nRight now we've got a problem in our asylum\nProcess are sound system and we've got loopholes in our laws as you point out especially with children that's making it difficult for us to enforce our laws um right now you've seen a spike in families at the border since the end of the zero tolerance policy I think it's been like Seventy five percent increase that's like a couple of months yup\nAnd so now everyone knows if you want to get into the United states bring a child as you point out it doesn't even have to be your child just grandchild through and as long as you can hold that Keith together\nFor a little while that Sharif together for a little while you get three right now and and I and our immigration courts are stinks the themes and because of this loophole we simply cannot remove them fast enough um that's something that Congress needs to change\nWell is there a way to stop this group before they hit American soil because I Know that a lot of people don't appreciate it does but if you get your feet on American soil then you're entitled to full constitutional rights if you're stopped\nShort of the border then you don't have any constitutional rights whatsoever so but is there a way to do that the president has threatened to use the military to stop this but\nIt does the military set up two feet south of the Mexican border or three feet north of the Mexican border\nYeah see and that's the problem I think the reality is that if you try to use the military first of all there's limitations on what you can even use the military for we have certain laws that prohibit the military from engaging in certain law enforcement actions because we don't want the military Kelly used being used for law enforcement\nRegarding a border is the job of the United states military isn't it\nI I agree the problem is is that when you get asylum law and to the issue if these people are supposedly coming across to claim asylum\nThen that's a wall that's being broken and so that's a law enforcement issue and that's really where the rub comes in and even if you get put that in the military at the border you Dan would have to say okay what ... you'd have to ... to have to cover every stretch of the of the\nOf the border and if they got as you point out uh one foot across the border\nThen what do you do they couldn't asylum and all of a sudden the military has to bring a nice anyone I think if people are going to come to two thousand or ... how many thousands of miles that is to get here they're just gonna keep on trying until they get a cry\nNow David I Know this is all of a situation where neither one of us has full details but\nThe president early on said to Guatemala and Honduras stop this group or you're going to lose your foreign aid which is something that is within his control I Believe you know the Congress can allocate the money and they have appropriate the money for foreign foreign aid but the president controls how's that ...\nAh the president is also said to Mexico you stop this group which they don't appear to be doing right now and if you don't stop them you may just lose that us MCA trade deal\nAnd it's an ... and it appeared I thought at the beginning when the president made that threat by tweet\nOr that Mexico was going to take that seriously is that an effective way to get Mexico to intercede and say we've offered a bunch of these people work permits but we will stop them in our country or is it to Mexico's benefit to or from their nose some it snows at that President Trump\nAnd say we're going to let them keep on going you figure out what to do with him on that once they get north of your border\nYeah I mean I think this this has further complicated by the fact that right now you are looking at a incoming New Mexico ... so even if we had a perfect partner in Mexico they were doing exactly what we wanted them to do\nThat's not necessarily going to the case in you know a couple of months the new incoming Mexican administration has indicated you know less willingness to cooperate with the United\nAnd it's an ... and it appeared I thought at the beginning when the president made that threatened by tweet\nA that Mexico was going to take that seriously is that an effective way to get Mexico to intercede and say we've offered a bunch of these people work permits but we will stop them in our country or is it to Mexico's benefit to a ... some its nose at that President Trump\nAnd say we're going to let him keep on

citizen you got to remember this\nGovernment is the largest employer it's the largest creditor the largest debtor there's a lot of people who are legion the government and they need time to get out and vote and not only that you have to workers you\nKnow what Chicago's like that's the only time these guys to work they got to get all the old people out driving my car now it's like oh for the for the in Brussels and they tell him which buttons to push this is to sustain and to grill the corruption within government so you're motivating\nWho exactly you're motivating the people that have something to game so that's why I think it's over it's worth it to me to me ... it's the few of us that they listen to the judge shows like the Joe Walsh show that you didn't fall off the ... the issue is the others are voting for their own increases their own pockets\nYeah he's showing a great stuff man thank you and thank you for a a a sitting in this chair last week yeah early voting is just another way to make it easier and easier for people to vote who have really a\n[laughter] who got no skin in the game but as Sean said they they they need to be taken care of let me go to a Laura Laura you're on with Joe\nHi Joe how are you I'm good\nWell I have to say that I um I thought I was on the radio\nAnd had a nails boy I Wish I was like you said because those are the things I've been

than when\nThey are no no no no\nThey're not supposed to be I Believe and I could have this wrong I Believe they are the first votes counted ah when the polls closed on election night that's the way

can address that in a couple a couple of weeks and gender or you\nIf you guys get some call in and if that went a little bit quick because I was afraid that we might get out go out again if you are a lot of countries we if we need to go deeper into vitamin e in general or vitamins and we need to get deeper into the deep and then how does that mean now we can adjust that in a couple a couple of weeks at\nAnd he was using a physical massage machine on his legs which helps the Olympic team that comes with these conditions and he doesn't have to do that anymore not only that he's back to work and I'm very pleased with that and making a living so and it\nYou know it was for him a pretty much wind wind deal and then there was an unexpected benefit that the sort of privately told me about it and that was he hadn't been able to have sex life for a while and all of a sudden that's back so he's he's pretty excited about it anyway so\nYeah that's that's one good story and again you know the rules are we can't say we cure treat any diagnosis or you know\nDisease that has a diagnosis but we can certainly talk about tissue improvement and uh you know handling the free radicals that come from things that go wrong in the body and that was the case of Lenny and if you've got\nYou know issues where there's blood flow desired life a marriage and that's your formulation it's pretty good for any soft tissue issue as well\nThat sounds great it's a little bit less in line you know maybe we can do a little bit more\nWell there are thirty four components um again five categories uh one category as antioxidant um\nMinerals now a lot of times when you look at a multivitamin you will see the mineral iron and I can't think of a circumstance where armed could be a a antioxidant but the tricky part about the minerals is you have to get the dose for I\nMean let me take for example lithium in small doses of a one to ten milligrams a\nDay is actually an essential antioxidant most of us pick it up in our diet but it would be a good component to it to um\nTo a general antioxidant formulation in fact we're probably going to be out in that with them next\nBatch [noise] but you have magnesium you have copper and if you're a cop or you have to have zinc because Cochran zinc traveled together and you have to get the dose right because if you get too much cooperative free radical\nIf they get too much as he gets a free radical I don't know do you remember that formulation colds I can that they were giving people for\nYou know and it's an interesting thing because what they did was they push the\nThe minerals is you have to get the dose for I mean let me take for example lithium in small doses of a one to ten milligrams a day is actually an essential antioxidant and most of his pick it up in our diet but it would be a good component to it to um\nTo a general antioxidant formulation in fact we're\nProbably going to be adding that with them next batch [noise] but you have magnesium you have copper and if you're a cop or you have to have zinc because Cochran zinc traveled together and you have to get the dose right because if you get too much cooperative free radical\nIf they get too much as he gets a free radical I don't know do you remember that formulation colds I can that they were giving people for\nYou know it's an interesting thing because what they did was they pushed the zinc over the top\nAnd when you do that you ... the zinc finger proteins and the taste buds and it ... your taste and smell for six months and sometimes permanently factor at a couple of lawsuits over so when you get to the minerals you have to get the dose right then you have to also get the partners right\nThen the next category would be the vitamins and again there's an interaction between the vitamins and the other components in the formulation\nLet me just pick a vitamin B. twelve and folic acid folic acid is actually being nine and then you also have be six in those three actually work in concert there like three and seven instruments from the symphony\nOr that kind of go together and you have to get the balance between those three right when we toss another one out which would be co Q. ten\nCo Q. ten is actually a co\nEnzyme because it is frankly made by the body in fact it's made by all cells in the body but by the time you get new your forties or fifties you're not making an adequate amount of it and if you're on a stat and you are suppress the co Q. ten production\nSo co Q. ten is an interesting thing because if you just take co Q. ten the absorption as a huge huge problem ah I've seen numbers as little as five percent actually gets in your body so if you're taking a hundred milligrams you got five well it's part of the formulation\nBut we have secret sauce in there and it's a combined with ... Cohen fuss titles Syrian and those are essential lip it's and because there is central lip it's they're actively taken up\nBy the bell there not passively absorbed across the ... goes oh look at that error there's some foster calling let's go get that stuff [noise] and the reason for that is that\nCell membranes especially in the brain a large percentage forty fifty percent of the cell membrane is made up of the hospital if it's so the body actively transports it into the bloodstream and then from the bloodstream into the brain and then when you add the co Q. ten\nIt tags long because it also is Philip but\nAnyway I could go on forever but can I tell another story okay well this one I called Dave David the hopeless diabetic\nAnd he's a thirty six year old guy who was actually legally blind because of his diabetes asthma very brittle form of insulin dependent diabetes I mean this guy could start off with the\nBlood sugar in the morning of fifty which is frankly an emergency anything below Seventy you're worried about and uh you might give them a little snack or you know peanut butter sandwich or you know bowl of cereal and around eleven o'clock in the morning\nMade up of the hospital if it's so the body actively transports it into the bloodstream and then from the bloodstream into the brain and then when you add the co Q. ten\nIt tags long because it also is the lip it\nAny way I could go on forever but can I tell another story [noise] okay well this one I called Dave David that hopeless diabetic\nAnd he's a thirty six year old guy who was actually legally blind because of his diabetes add a very brutal form of insulin dependent diabetes I mean this guy could start off with the\nBlood sugar in the morning of fifty which is frankly an emergency anything below Seventy you're worried about and uh you might give them a little snack or you know peanut butter sandwich you're in a bowl of cereal and around eleven o'clock in the morning and his blood sugar be five hundred which is teetering on the edge of going into\nA going into a coma from your blood sugar being too high I mean he was just really an incredibly fragile diabetic\nWell he lived at home with his parents because of the blindness and the basic disability he wasn't able to take care of himself and live independently and his birthday was coming up is thirty six\nBirth and so the family decided they were going to fulfill his dream you know what is that society will make a dreamer wish your dream or something like that where you take kids with terminally ill yeah making ... ...\nYeah so they decided to do and make a wish for him and\nWhen he was younger David Was a avid fly fishermen I mean right to the point of making his own flies and all that stuff\nAnd of course in Mexico you do fly fishing in mountain streams whichever temperature of all I don't know minus two hundred degrees Kelvin or in other words a little chunks of ice in the stream with you\nAnd I'm so they gave me his dream they took him up to the ... mountains they found a nice cold stream that have been stocked by state with trout and they get his old fly fishing stuff out and they went out there with him and gave them the and what he called the best birthday gift he ever had [noise]\nNow about five or six days later the family found him crawl into the bathroom because he couldn't walk\nAnd of course he's blind and sort of banned in some things that brought it to their attention well ah his feet didn't work that was a problem so they brought 'em in the emergency room and uh I was on call and went in to see him and hit tissue break down into feet\nAnd early ... and I mean what a deep and doing he'd been bouncing around in sub zero water banging into rocks with diabetic feet with poor circulation\nSo it's a darn nice setup for um you know causing injury to the feet and\nSubsequently or you know gang reenact cetera et cetera and I remember in the emergency room I took a pro put it in the bottom of his foot at the base of his small toe pushed a little bit and went right through the foot\nPretty scary um so and at that time I was a wound care hospital ah [noise] ah ... they were you know the principal doctorate wound care hospitals so we brought him over to the wound care hospital the breeders that wound um brought in surgical consultation\nAnd the real question is now we're going to cut off the leg below the knee or above the knee and you know I mean I'm sure you guys have heard these stories well he refused amputation the family back them up\nAnd um basically what happened was that a ... out of desperation put 'em on the life of managing formulation\nGang green cetera et cetera and I remember in the emergency room I took a pro put it in the bottom of his foot at the base of his small toe pushed a little bit and went right through the foot\nPretty scary\nI'm so at that time I was a wound care hospital ah [noise] ah ... they were you know the principal doctorate wound care hospitals so we brought him over to the wound care hospital the breeders that wound um brought in surgical consultation\nAnd the real question is now we're going to cut off the leg below the knee or above the knee and you know I mean I'm sure you guys have heard these stories well he refused amputation the family back them up\nAnd um basically what happened was that a ... out of desperation put 'em on the life of managing formulation and we did the usual debris meant and a semester oxygen and ah you know some antibiotics and some other things\nThat we would normally do in the wound care hospital but I didn't hold out a whole heck of a lot of hope but things pink top and the surgeon you know came by every day and all that happened was he lost his left pinkie left small toe the rest of the foot got saved 'em\nAnd the only thing I you know I'm going to blame the life I imagine formulation because it contains five components that didn't get around to that are there to increase vascular flow to the brain\nIn other words we want the formulation to get to the brain so what I did was include things like American ginseng and a Siberian ... Singh who balance off each other incidentally and they both give increase blood flow to the brain\nAnd at the time I put the formulation together I didn't think yeah and it's going to increase blood flow to the little toes and the the big toe and but it did\nAnd um you know so once again where you are in circumstances we need better blood flow um this is your formulation this is a very very good solution to that problem just talking with a physician in St Louis\nAnd she was you know telling some stuff that she markets out of her store and I'm you know she was telling me oh kid had this that and the other thing and it [noise]\n[noise]\n\nHealthy house call Arizona's popular live on a talk radio show was brought to you today\nThey\nHave all this time\nHealthy house call Arizona's most popular live on the talk radio show was brought to you today by healthy habit healthy at six zero to nine or seventh street and Phoenix, Arizona\nHow the house called features the latest breakthroughs in the world of integrative and functional medicine and wellness we feature world class education from manufacturers and local practitioner you can always laying on the conversation by calling six zero two to six six one thousand\nRemember all information discuss on how the house ... subject to your doctor's approval well you're not diagnosed treat or cure or prevent any disease always consulted position for all health concerns joined it may do friday at nine pm on KF an ex eleven hundred am\nYou're listening to independent ... eleven hundred Jay ...\nRussia will report bomb scares bombs that the Democrats and Trump critics right all the political world and cause police to spring into watching across the nation devices targeting former Presidents Clinton and Obama former CIA director Brennan George Soros at a former attorney general corresponded Pamela Brown\nThere was a suspicious package that was addressed to the former attorney general Eric Holder it was the wrong mailing address the return address on that the fishes package was to Debbie Wasserman Schultz that package within that\nOne device called the ... will back you waited to your golf as soon as New York police commissioner James O'Neill\nResponding offices identified a device that appear to be alive explosives device\nIt might be the bomb squad responded secure the device and remove it for investigation\nPolice also discovered is suspicious white powder sources say they believe there was a likely to all of the devices discovered this week or related are white march\nOn Capitol Hill members of Congress are reacting to the bomb threats\nIn a tree house Speaker Paul Ryan right to those behind such reprehensible lax must be brought to justice we cannot tolerate any attempt to terrorize public figures and house majority whip Steve ... tweets these attempted attacks that have been made or beyond criminal they're pure acts of terror\nViolence and Tara had no place in our politics or anywhere else in our society skull east goes on to say I have experienced firsthand the effects of political violence and I'm committed to using my voice just speak out against it wherever I can just glazed with nearly killed last year when he was shot at a congressional baseball game practice Linda ...

dollars in the last six weeks it's been crazy I mean for a minute or two mood but that's about it it does one minute charts\nSeveral times in the last six weeks mood maybe a hundred two hundred but it only lasted a minute and it popped right back up so there's a lot of selling anything that goes with the bitcoin soon as that goes on the market people are buying like crazy\nThey're turning around and selling it is buying and selling at the same time at a very rapid rate I highly recommend you pay attention on what's going to matter of fact just as we speak it dropped a hundred dollars that's what it is a lot of movement going on but those will be joining us for the first time this is the fly Mackey show\nWhere President Trump Bible thumping NRA type shall we specialize in bitcoin got a

of the ... remembers project and you're not going to want to miss that interview today she's coming up\nHere at the bottom of the second segment coming up here so I Want to talk a little bit this morning\nYou know the Clintons a Clapper who else a Soros um here's what we learned today something that we didn't know\nBut what we found out today\nThat CNN the Obamas Clinton's CNN apparently had their offices and the same place in New York same locations kind of funny how that is\nThe uh there was some bomb threats going out you guys pay attention to the news what's going on if they're anything breaks during the hour we'll bring that to you but um you know the the world's getting crazy out here\nSeveral things and in a nutshell basically we've had decades of this fake news and the media\nTelling people how to think how to vote and that's part of the problem and I mean we're not doing our own research but I think now with all this you know publicity and President Trump having and America First agenda as\nEvery single leader of the country should they they should have answer priority their country and there are people their citizens as their priority and legislate and govern accordingly\nUm and I think that as more Latino wake up and maybe we're just not into that I actually know about for Latinas who want to run for office\nUm you're probably not this time around but next time around look at um Texas just voted there I'm a very conservative Latina as the\nVice chair of the Republican Party mhm I'm you know so it's just a matter of being involved in actually stepping up this young lady has worked and I'm In her community and she decided to run and she\nShe won a you know so it's just a matter of fact who what people want to do and I think that it's\nShould they they should have answer priority their country and there are people their citizens as their priority and legislate and govern accordingly\nUm and I think that as more Latino wake up and maybe we're just not into that I actually know about for Latinas who want to run for office\nUm you're probably not this time around but next time around look at um Texas just voted there I'm a very conservative Latina as the\nVice chair of the Republican Party mhm I'm you know so it's just a matter of being involved and actually stepping up this young lady has worked and I'm In her community and she decided to to run and she\nShe won a you know so it's just a matter of fact who what people want to do and I think that it's open to everyone and now seeing that our country as such and such and\nBad situation in dire straits I think that\nMore Latinos are stepping up no but again you're right sometimes that um that peer pressure maybe people don't feel comfortable and as soon as you start calling people names you know a lot of people kind of shy away from\nYou know um I mean I I get it I've been trash out there a lot of fake information out there about me personally and my organization you know here I Am a working night and day nearly a completely volunteer for over nine years\nI mean doing trying to do the right thing and we started my husband and I um my husband's name is Tim lane he's a professional engineer now retired\nI'm you know we started just because we uh what what spurred us on was we were listening to an evening news and her that there were two police officers to different years who were killed by illegal aliens in one of the police officers' wives who filed the lawsuit against the city of Houston you researched it\nAnd found that the a reason for that lawsuit was century city policies would never heard of them I admit I was probably asleep fly and bought my my duty as a citizen was to take my little voter registration card and and you go and vote 'em and it\nNo I wasn't doing the research on whether or not my representative on my congressman or senator was doing what he put in his newsletter all that flowery business yeah I wanted to see how he really voted and that's\nYou know it forces to do extra work spend time on the Internet but and the follow up and here we found basically that um there was an epidemic of killings of Americans\nAll across the United states you know we both live in border states but you know I thought it was just a problem on the southern border on these days but not so much um and that's I mean here we are and look at and I think that there were never project made a difference\nIn the election as well because we informed public and we educated them and president and Donald Trump listened he created the office of voice as a response\nAnd a promise to the remembrance project voice is a victims of immigration crime engagement in order to give information to the families and now I Know that they're doing more trying to do more um so\nYou know here we are but liquid to people didn't look what you're ... fly so important to have an outlet like yours that tells the truth\nRight thank you so much you know you're you're born in Texas you regard in Houston you're you're the daughter of an immigrant father who immigrated to the United states from Mexico in the fifties\nHe um [noise] that must have been a a a fabulous David he the day that he was able to take you over and become a citizen here in the United states they must be extremely proud of you\nWith the um what kind of encouragement to the ... did they give you a\nDidn't and Donald Trump listen he created the office of voice as a response and a promise to the remembrance project voice is a victims of immigration crime engagement you know to give information to the families and now I Know that they're doing more trying to do more um so\nYou know here we are but look what two people didn't look what you fly so important to have an outlet like yours that tells the truth\nRight thank you so Murray and now you're you're born in Texas you regard in Houston you're you're the daughter of an immigrant father who\nImmigrated to the United states from Mexico in the fifties he um [noise] that must have been a of a fabulous day that he the day that he was able to take years old and become a citizen here in the United states that they must be extremely proud of you with the um what kind of encouragement do they give did they give you or\nI should ask you that there still are they still around [laughter]\nWhat kind of run out of my father\nIs not my father's not Margaret deal is but you know it's always encourage means a lot of love and encouragement mainly for my mom's side because dad really worked a lot he was a farm hand and then a lumber mill than he we own three restaurants fly so yeah all of them Eric and dream\nLower a lot of hard work a lot of hard work mom was a stay at home mom ah unfortunately they later\nI'm divorced um and it was very difficult for her but a growing up my father had a distant relatives who s a F foreman at a berry farm and in the area because we went to school there were born in Texas\nAnd um we went to school up in Washington state in the northwest in Washington is totally liberal now but um\nSo you know they're the school that we attended the whole entire community there ah they were a lot of agriculture so that kids during the summer um\nWent pick berries and blueberries and worked on the peace et cetera and mom took as that personally to the berry farm and we take on not on the students\nA field but on the Mexican field so we were picking berries with the micro Mexicans who came over had permission and then they went home where they wind up north to\nSouth uh to pick cherries or Apple's you know\nSo mom and dad made sure that we were kept busy and I think that also helped we all excel academically and an athletics I'm an all American ... Christian university\nYou know and I think that you carry those types of um kid that character and work ethic are with you entire life and here we are I think it's certainly has helped um with the remembrance project convene um you know just working hard at something that you really believe in\n... now when you're dealing with people you know you're five oh one C. three and you are people donating and helping you along the way because you got to be very expensive three going\nBack and forth to DC and running around the country\nDo you have a way to run people can contact you to

didn't die in vain right there's recently members right what what kind of interaction like\nWow him make me cry here well it's okay to cry you know the closest thing there's a strange topic [laughter]

through a permanent separation fly so yes it's a very emotional time um I think it's not for everyone um you know and some you know I reach out and you had time to other people who can help 'em and do a lot of praying [laughter] I was going to be in your players as well ...\nThank you very much and do you accept crypto currency bitcoin if they wanted to give some crypto to yet\nUm we um I have no

like they've they've they've turn that corner and if this is breaking news if they have been deemed a digital asset\nThat's that's a a groundbreaking right there so basically what that means it's not

could be on his way to the Supreme Court he could be on his way to being a defendant's up where he could be living in a cardboard box pretty much anything in between any of those and you know those of you listening to show for a long time no\nWe don't really talk much politics because you know as I've said off and on the show certainly in the past\nI've come to the conclusion that we've created a political problem in this country to which there is not a political solution\nAnd we spend all of our time worrying about what's happening in Washington or Phoenix or wherever it may be instead of focusing on living our lives and taking care of the people the institutions are important to us\nI think that a lot of it just becomes somewhat wasted energy and one of the reasons I think the understanding how the financial world works is\nIt gives you the ability to build an income to build wealth for yourself or your family your church synagogue dump all whatever it may be\nBut you can do that without having to get caught up in all of the the viciousness that has become the system but I Do want to talk a little bit of politics today\nSimply because it it how it's going to I think potentially affect the market and could potentially affect the market in a very great way I'm going to take a step back\nTo ... I remember it was an August and I'm thinking of a two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe I did a show and I did a follow up show on and talking about how people were losing trust an institution\nThink that a lot of it just becomes somewhat wasted energy and one of the reasons I think the understanding how the financial world works is it gives you the ability to build an income to build wealth for yourself or your family your church synagogue temple whatever it may be\nBut you can do that without having to get caught up in all of the the viciousness that has become the system but I Do want to talk a little bit of politics today simply because\nIt it how it's going to I think potentially affect the market and could potentially affect the market in a very great way I'm going to take a step back\nTo ... I remember it was an August and I'm thinking of a two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on and talking about how people were losing trust in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was there were only two groups\nIn and this was before ... and by the way some remember that part of it so whatever that you know a few months before that so they rate\nWhat are their only two institutions that more than half the people in this country had\nFaith in one of which was the military at Seventy seven percent\nAnd the other was cops at about fifty two percent\nAnd one of the points I made was and again this was pretty Ferguson is you know there was a lot of pressure already be put on kind of people's views of cops and that may not be holding given that it was only fifty two percent back then and that would have very important implications\nI have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people are predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious\nAnd just because I got cut off a little bit in the first segment therefore the class I'm going to be teaching is before the crash and the idea of this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is\nBefore the market goes down you got to know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down\nAnd I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through on the whole cabinet thing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious\nAnd just because I got cut off a little bit in the first segment therefore the classroom and to be teaching is before the crash and the idea of the classes and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is\nBefore the market goes down you got to know what you're going to do it before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up but\nThe average retail traitor will never make money in the downside\nThey essentially are passive and if you want a thought too about you know people keep coming in and told me they don't want to be traders they want to be investors well defined investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realize that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble\nThey put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong and again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is is that when the market turns down can turn down very quickly if you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of game think about this from it Thirteen Years of games in a year and a half okay if you want Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now\nHow is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down and you can on the move up so again in class we're gonna talk about all these ideas we're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people will focus on what's called technical analysis they're using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked winter like four okay you know you have your ... to ... and your are your ah see the eyes and you know the ... or hundreds of these things right [noise]\nSo how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different links and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got a I won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of the guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecast is really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now\nAnd the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes and that's a lot of this is that people use something because\nThe story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War

something because it's the best they think they've got\nBut it's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things are really understand about the markets is\nWhat trying to market to supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make there's a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but we always make sure that when we wrong we keep our risk really small\nAnd what it really is is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing as opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do so again if you want to come out to a class I'm going to be teaching this one personally\nWhen you come out if you if you

if you wait till they go bad is it happens way too fast and you can't react in time\nYou've got to be position before it happens now when the markets falls I mentioned the market when it fell in two thousand eight two thousand nine the market and the S. and P. gave back Thirteen Years of profits in a year and a half\nThat's how fast these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to two thousand level and that was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years and people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon\nMost people's investment horizon it's thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years\nYou because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside that's very very hard for people to achieve their goals\nSo we're going to be talking about how do we identify the prices would you begin to tuitions like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at you know when he was buying apple it a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five\nThat would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and I will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was fine apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics of how do I want to actually make money when this stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is that they invest in stocks because they think they're safe stocks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into\nBecause their markets only open six and a half hours a day Seventeen and a half hours of every day and forty eight hours of every weekend you cannot protect yourself yes you can use options to limit your losses but you're still going to have laws okay\nIf you had homeowner's insurance and it only covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected I think most people would not okay and my dad's the situation people in in them\nIt was by an apple those kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics of how I don't want to actually make money when the stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is that they invest in stocks because they think they're safe stocks or some of the riskiest things

yes you can use options to limit your losses but you're still going to have laws okay\nIf you had homeowner's insurance and it only covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected I think most people would not okay\nAnd that's the situation people in in the market so again to me this is an incredibly important class and I will I've ... I've taught this class before is always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those will be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThey the world is changed in my opinion from a marketing manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you could always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at it charged with looking it indicators which are the wrong thing\nDoes a fundamental we better approach again that I was teaching a class so if you want to come out and get to free tickets free tablet plus we'll feed you launch be one of the next dozen callers\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that's T.

year and you could look anything's possible you could even get a bit of a run next year\nBut what's going to keep taking this market higher and in the wind segment I told you a little bit about what I see evidence of the top and the market one is the fact that more companies are going public selling shares initial public offering to mom and pop cattle\nMore companies that have no profits than ever in history so Wall Street journal today to the eighty three percent of the company's going public right now have an earnings were gone public the last twelve months no earnings\nInto thousand the height of the dot com it was eighty one percent so that again is kind of a big bubbly sign\nNext big bubbly sign that the fact that you go to a place like Charles Schwab where it's retail traders not professionals okay they have their customers have less cash sitting on the sidelines than they've had an ad I think at any time in history if I remember correct\nBut they don't have a lot of extra money now you combine that with something else we've talked about before on the show which is what's called margin debt\nRight now in this country people are barred about six hundred and sixty billion dollars to buy stocks that's about three and a quarter percent of gross domestic product the entire US Economy\nSo what's happening is as people are taking the money they have been buying stock because most people are massively behind the eight ball you know I thought Stan the other day\nThat if you look at people even in their sixties\nThe average person had something like a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and assets okay hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars is going to get you anywhere with all due respect in retirement\nTo really get to where most people need to be

five not close\nBut what's amazing about it it's almost all equity in houses now part of a drive in the equity in houses is\nThe real world real estate mortgage rates are so low but there are going up

in the same uh it's the thing in the individual apparently behind it they had a Debbie Wasserman Schultz has the return address which is weird or the ones that Clinton SARS were not confirmed which is why didn't include those in there\nThere's a reason why I said they're specifically only for that they've confirmed because only four of them had Wasserman Schultz the ones that Clinton and Obama

closer devise a but this particular device uses steel piping\nAnd when you're shipping a package\nYou are you're being charged by the weight of it\nAnd so some individuals apparently some people who

[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd\nI'm just still I mean we're getting more and more developments in the president's apparently are going to be making some remarks about this and we'll take it live when it happens but and I'm looking\nHere that I see another I see another uh a\nPicture of it of the device\nI mean it's a pipe bomb I mean that's that I mean that's still\nYeah the the the\nIndividual that I was referring to her message me and said they still work with the post office had said if you're going to mail something if you know not a pipe off you're going to mail a heavy piece of metal like that\nYou would you would have to put it in a box they're not going to just lay stuff in one of those little bubbly on bullets and and mail it and that's just not going to happen but I still say this is I Do think ah\nThis is absolutely I mean it's some sort of\nIt is domestic terrorism I don't know how she put it\nIt's domestic terrorism so very and I mean and it is a goodness\nSo we're going to continue watching this this uh\nThis this story as it unfolds 'cause we're still getting development Sam\nAnd I don't want to engage in the speculation that bill de Blasio and Andrew Cuomo engaged in an earlier when they were giving press their press conference I'm I'm I'm not going to engage in that kind of speculation that's ridiculous we're not doing that\nUm but this I'm telling you it is a it is ... ... yeah I\nMean ... I mean six stance for the weight of the steel pipe fix stamps for the weight of a steel pipes\nI just don't I don't\nIt is domestic terrorism I don't know how she put it\nIt's domestic terrorism so very and I mean and it is a goodness\nSo we're going to continue watching this this uh\nThis this story as it unfolds 'cause we're still getting development them and\nI don't want to engage in the speculation that bill de Blasio and Andrew Cuomo engaged in an earlier when they were giving press their press conference I'm I'm I'm not going to engage in that kind of speculation that's ridiculous we're not doing that\nUm but this I'm telling you it is a it is\nYeah I mean ... I mean six stance for the weight of the steel pipe fix stamps for the weight of a steel pipes\nI just don't I don't see that\nI don't know I I\nSomeone also so Bryan on social media was also thinking hard to determine the explosive way but it couldn't have been much so I did yeah I Am just really\nYou've had this you have rights and that was sent well suspected writes into Trump to James Mattis to Christopher Wray Gina Haspel Heather Wilson to John Richardson earlier this month\nUm and then just when if they determine uh who sent this\nThen\nI mean this is just getting out of hand\nThis is just getting out of hand\nYou know just come on\nAnd it but but and that was that was\nThose were actual that was the actual domestic terrorism too I think this is also domestic terrorism\n\nSo we will uh\nWe're gonna we'll continue seeing and said it will continue following\nThe the development says we get them there was um apparently so now apparently a suspicious package was intercepted by Capitol Hill police and it was addressed to Maxine Waters according to several sources this this per a B. C.\nSo this is a\nThis is so distant to match the right\nAnd I don't know if this is the same it we don't know anything about it at All right now at this particular point except that\nThat was just it was intercepted in a it was sent a Capitol Hill police got it\nAnd and we'll see I'm sure we'll get more information more development as to whether or not it was like what we have seen with\nThe Brennan packaging that pipe bomb et cetera\nBut I'm just I mean it is just completely getting out of hand at this point um\nThere are a lot of theories going around there is a lot of stuff going on I like to wait as we get more information\nI like to wait and see and the reason I say this is I go back to when you know they had the the election um it Israel's last election what was it there there was there was a report that there was um\nA bunch of bomb threats to all of the Jewish centers and everyone was thinking oh it's the political system says and it turned out to be the just just knocked job teenager and Israel and then back in twenty four teen I'm scorn spouse\nTrying to find her husband ended up sending writes them letters to the New York city mayor and the White House back in twenty\nFourteen twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen so that's why I say you kind of always you all it's always\nI mean it is just completely getting out of hand at this point um\nAnd there are a lot of theories going around there is a lot of stuff going on I like to wait as we get more information\nI like to wait and see and the reason I say this is I go back to when you know they had the the election um it Israel's last election what was it there it was there was a report that there was um\nA bunch of bomb threats to all of the Jewish centers and everyone was thinking oh it's the political system set and it turned out to be the just just knocked job teenager\nAnd Israel and then back in twenty fourteen um scorn spouse trying to find her husband ended up sending rice and letters to the New York city mayor and the White House back in twenty\nFourteen twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen so that's why I say you kinda ... you all it's always smart to wait\nAnd then when you find out and then when when when we find out who and the motive\nThen by all means but\nYeah this was that the although there was no sorting code on the novel up there's no postage marks on the federal whatsoever this would never handled by by the United States Postal service this package with not handled by the United States Postal service at all\nThis with hand delivered\nThis point this ... this package with hand delivered so if it was hand delivered that means there's going to be closed circuit footage but here's the other thing I think about that\nNow it is possible because you have what you have the\nThe Clinton yeah I'm trying to get Clinton Obama joined DC\nYou have the I the Capitol Hill ones I Would imagine are those I'm sure we'll we'll figure out if those were\nUm hand delivered are mailed\nBut since all of these are hitting about the exact same time these all could not have been hand delivered correct\nAnd they do wouldn't that suggests there was more than one person involved right it's hard to believe because the hub were former presidents and the White House to get their mail is where\nThese were discovered so unless your hand delivering to that special instituted yeah the CNN the New York was right and then a month and and I don't know where the Clinton sorting facility was that's why you're you pointed out to action with those you know yeah that's exactly where it's a show\nWith some of it on now Laughlin mark hey over at\nThe Daily Beast\nSaid he thinks that there isn't a he says it looks like there's an ice it's light on a pipe bomb that was sent to Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nAlways I I I don't even want to try to before I verified but I Do think that it is\n... that would be very and I don't again\nI think it's even too early to determine that\nSo there's just a lot a lot here and then that and then that brings up a whole other you know are we going to have our mail system used for terror but this is absolutely domestic terrorism there's so\nMuch a there's a lot happening right now and uh\nAnd and a lot a lot of developments coming in on this and but I Am fat because that wasn't the only person who said this\nThis isn't the only person who said is a fucking ISIS flag and walk on my case not\nAnd I've ...

I only have enough information to say yeah this is organized because but not motive that you do you think you have a motive my gosh\nI mean what are we seeing some twenty sixteen antifa and others blowing up buildings\nUm assaulting people are being violent stopping traffic consulting people who dared drive on the road I mean all this stuff is the left never condemns as a matter of fact they've actually said most recently that all that's different than what the violent on the right as theirs is justified because they're\nThey're against you know Nazis and white ... whatever they decide as the justification so they've literally been violent all the way up to this point and now here we are less than two weeks out from mid term and all of a sudden the right decides to be violent there's no there's no logical sense for me\nOn this nobody from the rights is going to be doing this anyway as a matter of fact of the bombings that we know most recently how many of them were you know right leaning in thought anyway so I just don't buy it\nAnd I know that what we're doing here on the show today is just chasing facts and and that's exactly what we're supposed to be doing but I\nI just can't I'm not I don't buy it yet I'm Still convinced that this is this was a coordinated effort on the political left\nAlone with the media because again CNN really\nYeah everyone knows what they're reading so no one cares about CNN but this is you know again the I guess what CNN is getting a ton of clicks today I Wonder what you know right right you know it's just so there's so much for me honestly speculating level\nTo see that this isn't\nThis isn't the violin crazy you know what I mean what I'm thinking is that this was a coordinated thing and although I don't have any proof you know again I'm stupid for speculating\nBut I'd say it's hard and I just think I'm going to have another there\nI'd be right there isn't enough there but this is what at this moment I Believe\nOkay you can really that yeah yeah you don't believe that ah [noise]\nI still think\nI we don't ... other than it although there was um\nWhat was it the um\nRight right you know it's just so there's so much for me owners are speculating level\nTo see that this isn't\nThis isn't the violin crazy you know what I mean what I'm thinking is that this was a coordinated thing and although I don't have any proof you know again I'm stupid for speculating\nBut I didn't ask for it I just don't have enough there\nI'd be right there isn't enough there but this is what at this moment I Believe\nOkay you can believe that yeah yeah you don't believe that ah [noise]\nI still think\nI we don't ... other than it's although there was um\nWhat was it the um\nOne lock them are covered by the head noted\nThis was there was like a flag that was on it and I just live on that was the one that was central Brennan I have seen a million people say that\nIt looks but it looks like everybody wanted verify on their own it looks so it's almost like it but you want to verify\nBecause we're not frogs okay we like we want to verify\nThat you know there that we might speculations what little like ... ... are you saying my speculation as a way to look for a little bit so you\nKnow I'm not saying I just think it's too early I just think it's too early\nI just think it's really convenient time and I just think it's really widespread so that the size of it is a question or the motive is a question do you know what I mean I just think there's a lot of this\nBecause we don't know which is the you know that'll leads to the reason why I Believe what I Believe I'm of less they have something out there\nBecause again the ratio violent left these um Mm it's much larger we all know this is just prove these are facts even though the media doesn't wants that to be the message cars look we're less than two weeks out from it or you have to understand how the game is played we've seen this long enough and that's why I Believe whatever\nOkay well you can run with that that's going well and and I we just we just don't know enough about it we just don't know enough and I am a true ah ah\nVery fascinated in hearing\nMore about the other devices that were sent to other people's offices whether it was\nWasserman Schultz whether it was a you know all of these others I I Am very interested in hearing\nMore about because I Want to know if they match what was sent to these other offices I Want to know if it matches if Obama the Clintons Wasserman Schultz death at the one that if that matches what we saw was Brennan\nThat's what I'd like to see a show\nThey're you know that I mean it is what it is but um I was I'm I'm I'm\nBecause there's been I've seen some bomb disposal bomb disposal\nBomber disposal experts who were saying that it was almost ... it was almost fabricated to purposely like look like a Bob but not really be one now I'm not saying I ... I Know nothing about making bombs nothing\nSo I Am just so I I Know nothing about it I'm just reading what I see a lot of veterans and a lot of these bomb just don't hear that all of them actually yeah speculation\nBut they say that I'm trying to find actually I'm trying to find the some of what I've seen let me give me a moment and ... there's just a lot here okay so\nTo say do this it you know that I mean it is what it is but um I was I'm I'm I'm\nBecause there's been I've seen some bomb disposal bomb disposal\nBomb disposal experts who were saying that it was almost ... it was almost fabricated to purposely like look like a ball but not really be one now I'm not saying I ...

I'm very curious as to\nThey does does look like the one from Brennan et cetera\nI think you can\nDetermine whether or not you know that somebody who's an expert at what they're doing is it is it how many different people I mean do you think it's more than one person I kinda wonder\nIt's ... I mean it could be I mean good grief Ted Kaczynski was one guy\nIt could be and I I also want to caution everyone else to who immediately wants to camp sovereign debt speculation I don't know I don't know what you're talking about the remember back when\nWas the um there were all the bomb threats to Jewish ... after the election and it was this disturbed teenager in Israel and then in twenty fourteen [noise] ah you had a scorn spouse trying to find their husband who was sending\nWhat looked like rice done to the White House and to the mayor's office back in two thousand and fourteen\nAnd so it may not necessarily be you know you're there it could be ... something entirely bizarre\nOr it could be outcomes razor or it could not be I mean I'm just there's a lot there to consider\nShow there are a lot of questions to ask I think my biggest concern with all of this right now is whether or not again I don't know anything about making bombs which is why I'm I'm curious to know\nExpert laid this looks and how expertly this is going to how I mean if this was a click construction I mean we have one bomb disposal a tycoon says no because you want to know if you're working with someone who is skilled who knows what they're doing a\nAnd or\nThan to the White House and to the mayor's office back in two thousand and fourteen\nAnd so it may not necessarily be you know you're there it could be ... something entirely bizarre\nOr it could be outcomes razor or it could not be I mean I'm just there's a lot there to consider\nSo there are a lot of questions to ask I think my biggest concern with all of this right now is whether or not again I don't know anything about making bombs which is why I'm I'm curious to know\nExpert laid this looks and how expertly this is going to how I mean if it's with click construction I mean we have one bomb disposal tech who says no because you want to know if you're working with someone who is skilled who knows what they're doing a\nAnd or whether or not this is just some dumb idiot who\nEither is trying to act heart or it's trying to I don't know I mean every I think everything can be on the table right now but you want to basically know whether or not other people are in danger\nSo there you go\nSo far without that nations that doesn't appear to be and it seems like there's a lot of people a lot of authorities involved so it looks like we're going to whatever may be still out there which Cuomo flow to bed earlier when he was out there talking about it\nI'm I'm sure we'll be caught up in this drug Memphis now a centrally out there are people are hyper aware at this moment my right well same\nWay we have more to come up as well and uh we'll brave will bring you any other development that we get hopefully we have a lot of other show for you but I have to we'll see if we can get to that or not a but we'll have the latest in the meantime a got a good living on\nA different critter is a great resource to have a for any business of any size really a because when it comes to hiring their job sites that send you tons of the wrong resume to sort through and that isn't smart\nAnd it's not smart he is relative to filling it worthwhile you look for staff and when it comes to life it's not smart to make the lottery the centerpiece of your retirement plan but what a smart is going to defer critter dot com slash standard to hire the right person liberal critter doesn't depend on candidates finding you find them for you\nHi this is Jim ... republic monetary exchange I've said for years the secret to making money in the financial markets to buy low and so high there's now an unusual phenomenon precious metals markets gold is eight times the price of silver the highest ratio in Twenty years this is a great time to swap you're gold for silver\nTake advantage of this rare opportunity combined or officers on camel back row just east of forty of street or call six so to six days to go that six oh too strict say to gold or online at ... dot com\nThey listeners this is Terry CFO reporter was one of our many members would like to tell you about\nOur great company might I'm Guy with the ... or make all morning were made that um Avondale we had been with fireworks now for about five years so I Can't say enough about the company or Laurie who in the owner did\nTake advantage of this rare opportunity come by our officers on camel back row just east of forty street or call six so to six days to go that six to six eight to gold or online at R.

somewhere around three hundred thousand dollars a year in income that'd be one percent I'm actually only two percent of most of my savings account but so let's say I make three hundred four hundred thousand a year in interest you could tell that's incredible I could live off that dress well no\nThat's terrible\nThe rate of return on that investment is terrible now I go out and buy an apartment complex I met in the process of buying one right now when I buy that apartment itself cost me nine or ten million dollars\nWhich I'm not expecting you'd understand who's just take zeroes off of all this discussion\nAnd it will make me between nine hundred million dollars a year\nNow what's interesting about that is it will make it for me in tax free income in addition to that and it's about fifty thousand dollars a month in income if you look at it\nThat way but not counting the other auxiliary or ancillary type incomes and it makes up a bit about fifty grand a month which would be somewhere around see fifty times twelve is six hundred\nThousand dollars but it's paying down the mortgage another two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year now\nWhat's interesting is the depreciation on this which is the ability to earn income without paying taxes on is somewhere around a million dollars nine hundred and some thousand dollars so all that incomes going to be tax free\nRight\nIn addition to that because of the new tax laws the Trump past I'll probably get another two hundred fifty thousand dollars worth of deductions right out of the box the right off against my other incomes and other things so you think about this I'm going from let's say nine hundred thousand dollars or any one person\nLook at it that way but not counting the other auxiliary or ancillary type incomes and it makes up a bit about fifty grand a month which would be somewhere around see fifty times twelve is six hundred thousand dollars but it's paying down the mortgage\nAnother two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year now what's interesting is the depreciation on this which is the ability to earn income without paying taxes on is somewhere around a million dollars nine hundred and some thousand dollars so all that incomes going to be tax free\nRight and\nIn addition to that because of the new tax laws\nThat Trump past I'll probably get another two hundred fifty thousand dollars worth of deductions right out of the blocks the right off against my other incomes and other things\nSo you think about this I'm going from let's say nine hundred thousand dollars or any one percent is nine what would that be Ninety thousand a year or two percent a hundred and eighty thousand you're going from a hundred and eighty thousand a year to almost ... million a year in income\nThe hundred and eighty thousand would have been taxed\nAnd the million a year as tax rate you know what I'm Trump doesn't want to show his tax returns 'cause he make billions tax free you my friend every dime you put into that a savings account you're paying income tax on that or if you're putting in the four one K. and you're a you're not paying taxes this year\nBut somewhere along the line when you take it out you had to pay taxes on\nWe are going to avoid taxation both when we are in it and then later when we sell the property we're going to ten thirty one that forward and get out of paying it at that point also so you see what you're looking at here is the ability to earn ten times as much income\nAnd earn it with no taxation\nSo you look at a family and you say we or should your money be asked\nShould your money be at some place like you know when you go to your financial plan and see if we can draw down four percent a year and we won't run your money out until you're eighty years old nine years old me that really only earning two percent a year and then they're drawing down in the principal another two percent\nBut what did you could earn ten percent now I'm not even throwing in there all the other ways ... income for example when we buy properties many times we buy them in a distressed situation and we go in and we fix them up and we have immediate income from that we call that force appreciation\nForce appreciation is massive\nIf it's wraps around the rule to ten twenty five one hundred rule a ten percent increase in income because of the improvement of the property critic twenty five percent increase in value since we only have twenty five percent down payment or equities only twenty five percent that twenty five percent increase in value means we have a hundred percent\nGain on our investment a hundred percent gain on your best what can you imagine if you can increase your income or your investment network by a hundred percent a year how\nThat's unbelievable we also have that thing we're thing called appreciation you know rent just keep going up values just keep going up we're getting all that while you're money sitting there and it's the inflation is depreciating your money\n\nWe have the tax advantage of depreciation and the other one is when we produce these massive cash or capital gains we can refinance and pull that money on tax free\nTax free do understand that so we can pull out hundred two hundred five hundred million dollars and pay no taxes on whatsoever\nYou're not doing that\nAre living in a life of quiet desperation mediocre life\nIncome or your investment network by a hundred percent a year\nHow\nThat's unbelievable\nWe also had that big a weird thing called appreciation you know rich just keep going up values just keep going up we're getting all that while you're sitting there and it's the inflation is depreciating euro bunny\n\nWe had the tax advantages of depreciation and the other one is when we produce these massive cash or capital gains we can refinance and pull that money out tax free\n\nTax free do understand that so we can pull out hundred two hundred five hundred million dollars that pay no taxes whatsoever\nYou're not doing that\nYou are living in a life of quiet desperation mediocre life and you're living by a set of rules that are going to keep you there\nThe reason you're

that's not the ... see we true when I was talking about moral influence Obama and Clinton talk about the attempt in the need to actually wheeled immoral influence the big difference\nBack to the quote we intend to use all our moral influence at all or physical strength\nTo work for that kind of peace we can ensure such a peach only so long as we may remain strong we must face the fact that peace must be must be built upon power as well as upon goodwill and good deeds it'd only by strength that we can impress the fact upon possible future aggressors that we will not\nTolerate any threat to peace or liberty\nAnd quote can you imagine this coming out of any Democrat today I Want to tell you Truman or after yard JFK they would all be Republicans today if they were alive they absolutely would be\nI mean this um they would be repulsed by both the immorality and the violence of the new Democrat but the new Democrat Party which is why I called them demon credits\nNow I Want to contrast that with a few stories here with today's a Democrat Party and these are very pieces they there are no connection other than that the left is behind all of these\nAnd they come from different areas

turning your stadium to California\nI was asked this weekend [noise] what will happen at the Democrats win [noise]\nUm and then ask what will happen if the Republicans when my answer to this party is the same thing\nIf the Democrats win hell will break loose because they will see\nThe election as a vindication of their own ...\nFascist tactics that the alleged anti fascist employer see this is a whole thing about Federer said you know if you're a fascist then accused other people are being a fascist anti passes aren't fast they're the fastest\nThere though there the brown shirts that go around tearing up property and destroying an intimidating people and vandalizing things and threats and shooting people and beating them up\nThat's what the brown shirts did those were the ... that's your new left\nSo scenario number one Democrats win all hell breaks loose because they will use the election as a vindication of their own tactics\nIf the Republicans win all hell breaks loose also\nBecause they will see that and they have already said that those\nThey've said that if we lose that will be because we did not do enough of what we've been doing and we need to ramp it up\nIt will be the same thing because the laughter will view it as a need to upped the ante in the violence department up the intimidation up the threats\nWhich are coming from whether it's Maxine Waters about getting in your face Cory Booker a Hillary Clinton Nancy Pelosi um it just sort of doesn't matter that is your new left folks\nYou see I go back forty years ago I\nI was a Democrat shore of Iran as a Democrat for the Michigan the house of representatives in the seventies\n\nThey've said that if we lose that will be because we did not do enough of what we've been doing and we need to ramp it up it will be the same thing because the left will view it\nAs a need to upped the ante in the violence department up the intimidation up the threats\nWhich are coming from whether it's Maxine Waters about getting in your face Cory Booker a Hillary Clinton Nancy Pelosi um it just sort of doesn't matter that is your new left folks\nYou see I go back forty years ago I\nI was a Democrat shore of Iran as a Democrat for the Michigan house of representatives in the seventies\nI became a Christian I'm not saying being a Republican in a Christian as one of the same but I changed parties for reason which you'll find out here a few minutes\nI'm not suggesting that the Republicans have a lock on righteousness far be it from that being the true with the fact of the matter is more and more of them are going the way of the left or they're being polled left as the laughter moves farther left\nThe vacuum that the left his leaving\nJust left of metal as car it's causing the Republicans to move left of an of an old metal people say well the clock it all depends on those swinging back\nDoes or doesn't this pendulum swing back I said yes it does but the year but your analogy or metaphor here only works if the clock itself is staying in the same position\nAnd it is it if the pendulum comes back to the right it matters little if someone is pushing the entire clock to the left\nThan the pendulum doesn't come back really to where it was before it's just a new middle the new middle being far left of the old metal and that's the way a country goes when to depart from the word of God\nSo the question arose how Jesus vote\nNo I was asked this yesterday um and I answered a and gave me pause to think about a more complete answer would you will get here on this program [noise]\nBut I I I was still wasn't going to do it until I was asked to a party just told me yesterday he said you know people ask me what are you a Republican or a Democrat and the party said look I'm just a Christian I just want to do what Jesus said to do why do I have to be a Republican or a Democrat\nAnd I told the party I said they're not asking you if you're a Republican or Democrat when they're asking you are you a Republican or Democrat no it's not that simple they're asking you how are you going to vote\nThat's a question you see if there was no there was no voting whether you were a Republican or Democrat would be entirely an utterly meaningless whether or not\nBut the fact the matter is because we do vote and we vote our values and different values are reflected in the two camps now it becomes a question of how do you think meaning how are you going\nTo vote so how what Jesus vote\nYou don't want this is really a simple answer even though the left wing theologians mainly a good portion of your method is\n... when they're asking you are you a Republican or Democrat no it's not that simple they're asking you\nHow are you going to vote that's a question you see if there was no there was no voting whether you were a Republican or Democrat would be entirely an utterly meaningless whether or not\n\nBut the fact the matter is because we do vote and we vote our values and

deceived into thinking that everybody is on the same playing field and everybody is equal I'm tired of hearing while you're judging people did not Jesus say you know them by their fruit\nAnd what do

to helping you plan out first before you invest plan before you invest and hopefully help you get the confidence and clarity\nTo your overall financial re hundred financial retirement plan\nYou know a new study came out recently are called the real deal and talking about the uh suggesting that many workers may need to significantly reduce their standard of living during retirement if they retire at age sixty seven\nBut I find um it's actually from a on a study the real deal so you find that only one out of three workers who participate in their employers benefit plans over a full career or are expected to be able to retire with reasonably adequate retirement income\nAnd study provides insight into the overall retirement readiness of us workers with access to retirement plans based on data across nearly thirty industries\nPerhaps you have a pension\nBut six seven percent of the u._s. workforce current us workforce has a pension so if you're one of those that do have a pension\nI'm again just like Social Security benefits you want to become educated in what those benefits are in the climate strategies if you have a spouse you take you know a little bit less so that something happens to you your spouse continues the benefit or you were self insure yourself so you take a hundred percent\nAnd uh something happened to you you your spouse get nothing but they have the life insurance and maybe they get the same amount not reduced you know if you can structured that way but again become educated in your benefits and all the different climbing strategy\nSo as an example a Social Security benefits if you do not take 'em right away the other ... a means of income perhaps you have a pension\nAbout six seven percent of the u._s. workforce current us workforce has a pension so if you're one of those that do have a pension\nOn me again just like Social Security benefits you want to become educated and what those benefits are in the climate strategies if you have a spouse you take a little bit last so that something happens to you your spouse continues the benefit or you were self insure yourself so you take a hundred percent\nAnd uh something happened to you you your spouse get nothing but they have the life insurance and maybe they get the same amount not reduced you know you can structured that way but again become educated in your benefits and all the different climbing strategies and Social Security pension\nThen what's the third source it's the main source for many many people now and going forward and that's where the focus is on this retirement planning your own money you know looking at ways to structure your income from what you've saved\nTransitioning your retirement income I mean your retirement savings and retirement investments trained changing over transitioning that to retirement income\nYou want to try to build that strong retirement plan smarter retirement plan and look at various ideas for that income and how you're going to make that money your own money work\nAnd with that\nYou have to be focusing on or be aware of the risk involved\nYou know the risk involved with taking money from your own account so a couple of things to start with so you look at it okay well what about the question what do you think the stock market or your investments are going to do in the next ten years forget about the next year what about the next ten years there's going to be like the last ten years or is it gonna be something different\nAnd they're going to be like back in the Nineteen eighty four is going to be like two thousand and eight\nYou know you don't know but one thing you do now is that you should be looking at the risk involved and we'll talk about market risk a little bit later afternoon but the risk involved of retirement income\nPlanning longevity risk in the first one people are living longer\nOdds are people are living longer and will continue that and so you want to make sure that if that were to happen to you that you have income that will continue as long as you live and that you do not run out of income and that you do not run out of money and also for your spouse\nLongevity risk with longevity risk also come the health care issues people are living longer maybe they're healthy but maybe eventually there's some health care issues\nSo you want to make sure you address or consider the possible cost of healthcare now or in the future\nBesides longevity risk the other risk is dealing with what they call the sequence of returns or the rate of return you get on your money before you retire and the rate of return to get on your money after you after you retire\nThere a return you get on your money before you retire can have a major impact of when you actually retire and how much money you have\nThe right of return you get on your money in retirement I'll have a major impact on your income and your ability to keep the money and the account\nTo have an income\nSequence of returns thinking about this and so you know the market up and down your account up and down if it goes down right before you retire you know maybe ... and a downturn in for a cup\nCost of healthcare now or in the future\nBesides longevity risk the other risk is dealing with what they call the sequence of returns or the rate of return you get on your money before you retire and the rate of return to get on your money after you after you retire\nThere a return is you get on your money before you retire can have a major impact of when you actually retire and how much money you have\nThe right of return you get on your money in retirement I'll have a major impact on your income and your ability to keep the money and the account to have an income\nSequence of returns\nThinking about this and so you know the mark it up and down your account up and down if it goes down right before you retire you know maybe ... and a downturn in for a couple of months or year how's that going to affect your account balance\nYou know you go back to the example of two thousand seven somebody was going to retire in two thousand eight and all of a sudden they lost thirty forty percent of their their four one K. money yeah maybe they had to delay to retirement yeah the money came back from actually but you know they and they continue to contribute but took a while\nTo get the other side suppose you or were already retired for a couple of years experience some some good up turns for a while and then your investments taken ... everything's great\nAnd then next thing you know two thousand eight hits you lose thirty forty percent of your account value in taking money out may be the same amount and now say you're getting double header double whammy and now maybe taking longer for your account to recover maybe it has recovered what happens is if it happens again\nSo the sequence of returns and being able to ... not knowing what your account values are going to do that you know now and then and then in the future\nAnd then the third risk is the withdrawal rate how much percent what percent how much can you take from your investment accounts what's appropriate percentage withdrawal right to to withdraw\nIt four percent yeah you go back you know there was at five percent at seven percent you know the wall Street Journal a couple of years ago I had the article in the four percent rule dead\nYou know talking about studies that have taken place dealing with a you know looking at it for pretend withdrawal rate and the ability for the money to last\nYou know the Texas Tech study from the professors back in two thousand Thirteen took a million dollars could four percent out looking at various ways to invest the money all in the market all and bonds or a combination there of\nTook out at four percent wanted to go back in time when I went through a different time periods thirty five year segments\nThirty five years because eight sixty five page one hundred is thirty five years wanted to make sure there was money left it in the end of the day fifty three percent of the time they ran out of money\nYeah sometimes the money last in the paid Ninety sometimes it only lasted at age eighty two\nSo you gotta be careful here they go back and say what they said ... what you are right so that a hundred percent of the time the money would last one point four percent\nOne point four ... four percent a million dollars that's fourteen thousand dollars is that gonna cut it now maybe need to look at other ideas more recent study from another investment from from an investment firm\nLooked a a I Believe it's either Seventy percent stocks thirty percent Bonner sixty forty split somewhere around there\nSaid um took out four percent look back in history and they're projecting going forward using money Carlo analysis basically trying to project going forward based on what's happened in the past\nSome of the time they ran out of money yeah sometimes the money last and paid Ninety sometimes it only lasted at age eighty two\nSo you got to be careful here they go back and they said what's a sustainable which All right so that a hundred percent of the time the money would laugh at one point four percent\nFrom one point four ... four percent of a million dollars that's fourteen thousand dollars and that kind of got it now maybe need to look at other ideas more recent study from another investment from from an investment firm\nLooked at a I Believe it's either Seventy percent stock thirty percent Bonner sixty forty split somewhere around there\nSaid um took out four percent look back in history and they have projected going forward using Monte Carlo analysis basically trying to project going forward based on what's happened in the past\nAnd they said you have ah around eighty five percent chance of making it work\nWell maybe that sounds pretty good but you know you know somebody tells you you're going to win the lottery you know this weekend you're probably and you have a five percent chance of winning you probably go buy a lottery ticket\nBut you get on an airplane and the pilots said you have a Fifteen Percent chance of not plan has a Fifteen Percent chance of not making it to its destination are you going to stay on the plan\nOn the plane so you know think about that so the different risk involved that needs to be understood and least addressed in your retirement income plan longevity\nPeople living longer wanting money to last year and come to last\nSequence of returns not knowing what your accounts are going to\nDo before you retire and then after you retire when you take an income from them and what percentage rate should you be taken out from your accounts what's the appropriate or sustainable withdrawal rate for yourself\nYou know so it all comes down to that make sense to look at ideas the position accounts to position portfolio your portfolio so maybe you can minimize the risk\nYou know they're always going to be there and I pay maybe can address them and minimize them in a way that maybe you can generate more income not subject to stock market ups and downs and income that subject to interest rate movements whatever the Federal Reserve done now we're in the future\nAnd not subject to inflation 'cause you'll be able to give yourself a raise overtime\nAnd all the while to protect and in case there was a health care issue so that income will still come into the household\nSome idea maybe different thought process to look at as far as being able to generate that income in retirement understanding the difference between accumulating money for retirement and then distribute in income in retirement\nVery important to understand more and more people are starting to understand as you'll start to see more\nConversation there was a book a consortium of a investment companies\nAlliance putting together that are trying to communicate the more that more people have to focus in on
