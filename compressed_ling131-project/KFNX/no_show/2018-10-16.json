because she had seen the scores and in an argument with representative send them out because she was asking well what's changed why can't we just keep it as it is and Peggy passionately saying it's

women act so I Would encourage folks to go take a look at the votes and as we heard this morning in the Arizona Republic this is ridiculous we asked people to just go look at our vote record because it speaks for itself\nYes it does speak for itself and that is absolutely ally that's like a procedural vote that she's pulled a few out there that have nothing to do with the author as I recall threatening violence against women act so please don't believe that\n[noise] I'm going back to congresswoman cinema and to the original question about Brett Kavanaugh one of the main sticking points on both sides has been discussion about whether justice Kavanaugh would support overturning roe versus Wade where do you stand on that issue\nI Believe decisions important such and such that should be made between a woman her family and her doctor free from government interference\nAnd where do you stand on that I Am pro life and I have a very strong pro life record so you would support overturned on right now I'm focused when it comes to judges on how they interpret the constitution and how they interpret the laws that we make it's not a particularly mishap but I have a very strong pro life record\nSo you would support the overturning roe v I\nWould support appointing justices I mean it it it's an nothing to do with what Congress is working on where the Senate I Would support appointing justices that aren't are looking independently at the constitution and at the law that we make a and that they will have a good decision making process based on that [noise]\nIt's a lot to going to help share a congresswoman Shelley [noise]\nHow much should government be involved in health here especially when it concerns folks find it difficult to get healthcare specifically those with pre existing conditions what is the government's role well\nThanks head for the opportunity again to debunk another attack or for my opponent I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions to make sure insurance companies were forced to give them health care had no cap uninsured and could not canceling that is that they flat out lie we cannot go back to where we were before Obamacare\nWhere people or one diagnosis away from going bankrupt because they could not get access to health care\nAnd so it although we're trying to fix it\nObamacare was the wrong or you know the wrong approach it's a trillion dollars in taxes it rotting Medicare by seven hundred and sixty billion dollars it mandates and penalties that\nWere really intending to go up to those who are falling through the cracks we didn't get healthcare from their employer or Medicare and Medicaid it is it's about seven percent of people and they're falling through the cracks there is still falling through the cracks

sixteen billion dollars its mandate and penalties that\nWere really intended to go up to those who are flying through the cracks and didn't get healthcare from their employer or Medicare and Medicaid it ends up in about seven percent of people and they're falling through the cracks there's still falling through the cracks head because I I met an entrepreneur this last week who decided to start her\nOwn business over had created the conditions but because of Obamacare and because of the sky rocketing caught she has no coverage right now more people will pay the penalty last year than\nActually bought insurance on the Obamacare exchanges so we have to address the issue and we've got to make sure we protect people with preexisting conditions but the Obamacare model has failed we move forward with up an approach that gives people tax credits and give them options to shop around\nMore and more small business support have association health plans more opportunity for people to give to health savings account that still can provide affordable available a health insurance for them which isn't working right now under Obamacare So we've got to protect it at the federal level there should be apart\nBut it's that's made it at the state as well where there's more options for them to be innovative because what works in California is not what works in Arizona were ...\nWell I'm so glad we're talking about health care because it is the number one issue that I hear from folks both on the campaign trail if I traveled upstate end in my office in the United States Congress\nArizona's are very worried that they will lose coverage for those with preexisting health conditions nearly three million Arizona instead with preexisting health conditions one example the woman named ...\nUh she lives in Scottsdale she was diagnosed with diabetes when she was in high school\nAnd she's been taking five insulin shots a day for forty seven years but when Martha voted last year\nTo repeal existing law it wouldn't want a lemonade at the protection for people who live with preexisting conditions in our country today she also voted to repeal that same protection at two thousand Fifteen so the reality is that Arizona is are\nAbout losing access to this critical coverage and Monica voted to take that protection away\nThat it's just a flat out lie again either just classic fear tactics if you turn on a TV all over the country right\nNow the Democrats have nothing to run on and so they're choosing to play with fear I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions and as we were moving forward and nothing was moving through the Senate related to this issue\nFourteen or Fifteen counties in Arizona there was only one choice last year that is not a choice and the premiums are going up over a hundred percent year to year there's so many people right now a pre existing conditions that can't get access to health care because they Obamacare model doesn't work\nBut when things came to a standstill and we were watching the individual still not able to get access to health insurance I sat\nDown with my Democrat colleagues and the problem solvers pockets and we sat down to see if there's any way we can find some common ground to help people get access to health insurance and we came up at the time\nWhen there was a man a couple of our Democrat colleagues out there with the way for it in my office we know when we can disagree on but if there's something we can find to help stabilize it's marketed as it was collapsing and we came up with a plan at twenty three Democrats or Republicans and it leads to the majority of the group agreed to so we showed that we can break through the gridlock\nThere was only one choice last year that is not a

with a planet twenty three Democrats and Republicans and it leads to the majority of the group agreed to it so we showed that we can break through the gridlock solve the problem and actually help people get the insurance that they deserve and get the care that they deserve\nWith the conditions that they have in their family again Doberman players in health care\nWhat one thing I think all Americans can agree on its we cannot go back to a time when people couldn't get coverage when they had preexisting health conditions so Wal Mart that talks about a working group\nAnd part of the problem solvers pockets which I Am a proud member of\nSo don't listen to the talk I even leading on the issue and she had the opportunity to vote for Bill Frist thirty eight billion dollars of border security ending family separation moving towards a merit based system and providing a legislative solution on DACA\nHere's a visual work with anybody but when it came down to it all the Democrats including chairs in voted no and it's very important compromise bill President Trump supported it she had given the opportunity to vote yes and she voted no response please\n... bucks my party over the years to do what's right for our border you know folks on the east coast and from far away don't understand the issues of the border like we do but I was born and raised in Tucson and I've been living around the border for most of my life so that's what's real for us in Arizona and that's\nWhy when opportunities came to work across the aisle to do what's right for our state I was willing to talk to my party so I supported a ten million dollar increase for our\nCustoms and border patrol agents five billion dollar increase for ice agents and have voted for legislation such as capes law\nAnd the gang removal act which allow it to crack down harder\nOn these bad dangerous guys who are committing felonies and hurting people in our community the reality is that this is an issue that I've been working on my entire career it shouldn't be a partisan issue and it's not a partisan issue only when some people choose to make it part it's and that's my house\nOr you know folks on the east coast from far away don't understand the issues of the border like we do but I was born and raised in Tucson and I've been living around the border for most of my life so that's his real for us in Arizona and that's\nWhy when opportunities came to work across the aisle to do what's right for our state I was willing to talk to my party so I supported a ten million dollar increase for our\nCustoms and border patrol agents five billion dollar increase for ice agents and have voted for legislation such as capes law\nAnd the gang removal act which allow it to crack down harder\nOn these bad dangerous guys who are committed felonies and hurting people in our community the reality is that this is an issue that I've been working on my entire career it shouldn't be a partisan issue and it's not a partisan issue only when some people choose to make it part and that's my has done since it's become a fight in the United States Congress\nTold us when to nuclear name off the recognizing American children earlier this year which are targeting dreamers and support streamers you will for that all of a sudden you pulled her name off of what was that old\nSo I've consistently shown that I was willing to do something on DACA but we have to secure our border\nTo address the root causes of why we have a ... population the first place to make sure that we don't make the mistakes of the past and so as we were working on this issue when the president kicked doc doc Congress appropriately my man and a couple of other\nRepublicans Santa Rosa for many many hours and came up with legislation that would solve the issue secure the border and address the issue of DACA and when it was brought up to a vote children's cinema voted no we then had\nCompromise bill which was twenty five million dollars worth of security the president still supported it in a pathway to citizenship for except for DACA\nBut at the loopholes or the cartel they're taking advantage of right now and we were in the midst of this discussion\nIt looked like some people were going to force a vote on just stand alone bill related to DACA I wanted to make sure it was clear we've got to secure\nOur border I'm willing to do something on DACA but we've got to secure the border and closing loopholes of the cartels or trafficking people into our community and and the opioid crisis that's killing Arizona that every single day\nI jumped in and let on the issue it was given the opportunity to vote yes or no twenty five million for border security in the second bill plus a pathway to citizenship for DACA and ending family separations she chose to vote\nNo along with Nancy Pelosi real quickly do you support a partial government shutdown to fund a border wall\nI look I don't support shut down for anything I've been in the military I've seen the the the devastating as a result of government shutdowns Washington D. C. needs to be able to get their act together and they need to be able to fund the government and fund our military\nBut you know given that opportunity last year when there was a lot of pressure from chairs and debate to address that issue\nShe voted with Chuck Schumer just shut down the government to illegal immigrants over our troops in a partisan play that she talked today in game about working with anybody but when given the opportunity to actually solve this issue she left our troops hanging\nOn Mars they continue to talk about very part it's instilled in very partisan activities but the reality is that during this discussion of talking about immigration how to solve our\nProblem we do have bipartisan legislation\nThe bill you mentioned had that my last name from\nI'm a ... sponsored that legislation I was actually the first Democrat in the country to join with congressman Carlos Curbelo Miami to sponsor that legislation and I cut sponsored an original co sponsored a bill called the usa act which I mentioned earlier which both secure our border and provide a path to citizenship for dreamers my has chosen not to\nSchumer just shut down the government to illegal immigrants over our troops in a partisan play that she talked to Dan game about working with anybody but when given the opportunity to actually solve this issue she left our troops hanging\nOn Mars they continue to talk about very partisan belt and very partisan activities but the reality is that during this discussion of talking about immigration how to solve our\nProblem we do have bipartisan legislation\nThe bill you mentioned had that my most her name from\nI'm a ... sponsored that legislation I was actually the first Democrat in the country to join with congressman Carlos Curbelo of Miami to sponsor that legislation and I cut sponsored an original co sponsored a bill called the usa act which I mentioned earlier which both secure our border and provide a path to citizenship for dreamers\nMy has chosen not to support that bipartisan legislation and instead has chosen to support only legislation supported by one political party and I believe Arizona deserves better\nAnd so when there was a opportunity for folks to get very partisan which they did and they do on a regular basis I was part of the bipartisan group trying to solve that problem we offered are building usa act unfortunately party leaders in both parties rejected our proposal\nCongresswoman mix Sally you mentioned family separation at the border did you support the Trump administration's a so called the euro tolerance policy at the time are there any circumstances under which here okay what families being separated that way this administration because of the laws that are on the book was put into that situation where they had to\nEither and fought for the law or keep families together I think we need to do both\nAnd mind ill and the uh the second bill that cares and voted no on would've ended family separation it would have provided an opportunity for there to be due process and keep families together while they were they were process for their illegal entry or process for asylum\nWe're also were increasing funding for immigration judges so we could end this catch and release look the reality of the cartels know right now that if you show up with a kid you're going to be let go\nI've got a call this weekend from the you know mayors saying he would panic that two hundred or more people every single day we're going to be just let go into a ... and they didn't have the capacity because they showed up with a kid and we're seeing the activity increased every single week\nAs they cross the border illegally they know they're going to be let go there's also a case of the border patrol are telling us about where people are not what a child of the person who's bringing them in and this is increasing the incentive to traffic children across the border\nSo my bill fixes legislatively and\nHad the opportunity for us to enforce the law and keep families together and that was the right approach\nYou know she can talk about different bills she got on but the one she had a chance to load on the one that was a compromise that President Trump supported ended family separation fix DACA and securing the border\nBut you're loaded support sanctuary cities she voted to cut eyes she's very dangerous on this issue next year we secure our border it's Ninety seconds for bottle flea\nMarkets shared a lot of information just now that frankly just not accurate the reality is that the Trump Administration made a decision to separate families at the border\nIn an attempt to try and provide deterrent but that is the wrong decision separating families that's not reflective of American values we can both secure our border\nAnd keep our country safe and secure without taking children away from their parents there are ways to do this quite easily by monitoring families and moving them through the process of adjudication more quickly but Martin has chosen to move down a road again very partisan and she's\nAnd fix DACA and secure the border but you're voted to support sanctuary city she voted to cut ice cubes in very dangerous on this issue I mean you know make sure we secure our border\nIt's Ninety seconds for bottle played\nBy mark I shared a lot of information just now and it's frankly just not accurate the reality is that the Trump Administration made a decision to separate families at the border\nIn an attempt to try and provide deterrent but that is the wrong decision separating families that's not reflective of American values we can both secure our border\nAnd keep our country safe and secure without taking children away from their parents there are\nWays to do this quite easily by monitoring families and moving them through the process of adjudication more quickly\nBut Martin has chosen to move down a road again very partisan and she says we have to compromise legislation I think she means compromise with ourselves because there was no bipartisanship in any of this discussion which they credibly disappointing for Arizona's\nAnd the reason there is no bipartisanship because Nancy Pelosi decided that Democrats were not going to join and you think about President Trump supported that bill and he took a lot of flak from it from both directions trading securing the border\nClosing loopholes moving towards a merit based immigration system and providing a path to citizenship for DACA I mean that is the definition of a compromise on this issue look most Arizona and agree we got to secure the border and family separation and address these other issues\nAre villas a confidence building measure that was also addressing them very real security issue\nOf the cartels that are trafficking ... community there is not just hypothetical children has forced random barbed wire\nUp at the international boundary you saw yourself when you went down there one family added secure the border now\nWhat's family separation at your polling shows a choice that the president could have made to keep families together as opposed to what used to use the law where we had no choice does the\nLaw on the books and to enforce the law and so he was there a miniature version was put in an untenable situation whether you're either enforce the law keep families together I think we can all agree families shouldn't be separated\nBut I think we can also agree we need to enforce the law border security is national security and the definition of a country that we control who it's coming in and out of our borders\nSo enforcing the law superseded shipping family hunger\nIs needs to fix this had it's our job to fix the law and so that's what we've been doing and that's what I'd been leading on and here's been voted no on both the bills that would end family separations the law is a law\nThat says a very big difference of opinion between the two

man was beaten to the ground\nIt was originally charges a hate crime and then the ... the I jumped in and drop the hate crime charges or the last I checked is there anyone from the religious Jewish community in Brooklyn New York with this occurred\nWho could update the audience\nRight now as to whether or not\nThat delivery driver was charged with a hate crime because to me first of all the guy had a prior rest you know that\nI Know that's not supposed to ... but it does count\nEight prior arrests heats up an old Jewish guy in the street make it look like World War two black and white some of Nazi era Munich\nAnd I'm supposed to sit there and make believe it's just a random occurrence it wasn't the random occurrence if you're bringing in people who have a certain ethnic group\nThat is already here what do you think it's going to happen in this country they're going to bring the hatred with them\nThat's what I mean by defeating an enemy before you fire shot\nSo this is what's going on in the country but I'm not getting any religious Jews calling it I'll listen to the show\nThey don't believe in trade for like this not smart enough and they said they stick their nose in the

to a stick fighting\nSo they combine their religious leanings with survival\nThis just sadly missing in the western Jewish community is\nVery sadly missing\nIt's not good enough to just study religious tracts\nNo you have to combine it with survival or else you can repeat history and getting the most negative way\nI've been trying to say this for forty years but no one listens to me it falls on deaf ears you know years ago\nI was a very very interested in\nIn in in the Jewish ... the the ... movement the Jewish people\nAnd I started to hang around with them because I felt they had their finger on on the ancient teachings and then I saw they were eating garbage poison just garbage fat salt sugar the worst food ever saw in my life and most of them was sickly\nOut of shape this and that so I wrote a a an article\nIs kosher junk food ... I don't know if you're Jewish you have to be Jewish to understand that it was a widely ignored article is kosher junk food dish kite meaning it it's kind of ironic when I said\nMeaning you're eating a fully because they snap a kosher symbol on it it's good for you because it just a stamp while you're eating garbage full of sugar and you don't know why you have diabetes you sit on your behind all day and ... and you wonder why you're you're getting sick I Try to enlighten people in a wet nowhere\nNear you or what not only a lot of people you know don't want wisdom\nIt doesn't matter whether it's the\nPresident of the United states or religious organization they only want to hear what they want to hear from people they want to hear from\nAnd so what does an independent scholar like myself do what I Do is I keep on trucking along as they used to say I keep on going along that's all keep on doing my thing until the clock runs out\nWhen the alarm clock goes off or it'll be good by that so\nI'm not going to change my ways I Can't this is what it is\nYou know is kosher junk food jihadist type great article you don't even know what I'm Talking about and number two Trump shows that there Leslie stall Vostok ice core samples she would have been stumped that would've been the end of the argument\nBut a three hundred and twenty five thousand years ago global temperatures and C.

America I have to start off with some news that we literally God just seconds ago and that is that Paul Allen the cofounder of Microsoft the owner of the Seattle Seahawks\nIn the Portland TrailBlazers has died sixty five years old\nUh the announcement came out from Vulcan which is Alan's investment company this just came out he announced two weeks ago that his non Hodgkin's lymphoma was back\nNow he was treated for about nine years ago I have to tell you something that\nI've worked for a long time in radio forty three years in radio for a period of time my flagship radio station which is Kay exhale radio in Portland, Oregon that's where our studios are located was owned by Paul Allen\nHe bought it because the Portland TrailBlazers were on the radio station and I don't know that he ever set foot in the station but I met the man on two very brief occasions even though I worked for him drill paycheck from him it it wasn't something that put me under close contact with Mr Allen\nAnd I have to tell you my my impression of him is that he was a guy who was a very simple guy kind of an unassuming guy when he bought a ball team\nHe wanted to be involved in the decision making about how the ball team rent some times that was for good sometimes otherwise but on two occasions I met the man in on one occasion\nHe was on this radio show the two occasions were very different\nOne was when a friend of mine said hey I've got tickets to go down to Los Angeles and watch one of the playoffs a playoff games where LA or LA was playing the Portland TrailBlazers and during the have to at at at

Bill O'Reilly dot com redo a thirty minute a news analysis every night for a subscribers and tonight I kind of tied in a what's going on in Portland, Oregon uh with wheeler the mayor\nTo um what's going on with Kavanaugh\nWhat happened there and the media is continuing drift into the far left precincts and my conclusion is\nThat many Americans were independent they don't they're not a writer left I've had enough\nThey've had enough and that's going to help the G O P and the elections three weeks from tomorrow um because I think it was pretty obvious to anyone watching the ...\nWith which the far left went after justice Kavanaugh agree\nAnd I don't think Americans like that and I think that's what's going on\nBill will and help them enough to maintain control of the house which is the thing that's most at risk\nI don't think I don't think Kevin who's going to help the far left at all\nNo I mean do is going to help the right to maintain control of the house all the ... because ...\nUm [noise] it's hard to say because\nIn the Senate is pretty much has shored that the Republican Party will add\nSeats exactly I see it at fifty fifty I see it about fifty four fifty five they'll have yup but in the house because it's so wide spread all over the country it depends on the individual candidates how much money they have a much charisma they have how they frame their message so national\nCommentators like me it's a very hard to evaluate that\nUm it's a ball in\nEvery precinct and um the wild card a lot is money and when you add the progressive left a lead by George Soros pumping big money and to congressional campaigns around the country that's a big advantage for the left and that's happening\nBecause you know that if they hang on to the Senate or even get a stronger hold but lose the house then an awful lot of the Trump agenda which I'm In favor of simply stumps doesn't it\n[noise] yes and that's what happened to block Obama and his second year uh he lost a majority in both houses so he couldn't get anything done so what did he do he did executive orders\nAnd that's what President Trump will do is on a bevy of ... of executive orders to get his agenda flowing so he's assured of being competitive in two thousand twenty so if the Democrats take the house or you'll see a lot of executive orders in two thousand Nineteen large\nThat's going to put a lot of us conservatives in a tough spot because I think there is a place where exactly\nBig advantage for the left and that's happening\nBecause you know that if they hang on to the Senate or even get a stronger hold but lose the house then an awful lot of the Trump agenda which I'm In favor of simply stops doesn't it\n[noise] yes and that's what happened to block Obama and his second year or he lost a majority in both houses so he couldn't get anything done so what did he do he did executive orders\nAnd that's what President Trump will do is on a bevy of ... of executive orders to get his agenda flowing so he's assured of being competitive in two thousand twenty so if the Democrats take the house or you'll see a lot of executive orders in two thousand Nineteen large\nWell that's going to put a lot of us conservatives in a tough spot because I think there is a place for executive orders a very limited place but I think most things should be done through a legislation if you want to change the law you don't do DACA because that's clearly something that should have gone through the Congress you you but the Obama wouldn't do it that way or the other\nThing though and let me ask you about this and then we'll get to the book\nAnd that is in the nineties when ... when Clinton saw that his agenda was not going uh well he he did some course correction and said this isn't working for us we need to do a few things differently that will the left to be smart enough to do that as they see that these tactics are not working to their to their advantage\nYou see your [noise] it's a it's an excellent question you're asking but I see it a little bit differently I don't think there is a left in America anymore I I think there is a progressive far left you know\nThat has allied with their um enablers in the media and who has crashed liberal people\nCrush them so you're not seeing moderate Democrats say a word there was a recent study done it says eight percent of Americans large are far less people but that's what you hear\nYou hear Bernie Sanders you hear canal heresy here Cory Booker you hear Elizabeth Warren yup you don't hear the moderates are the Democratic side and they are afraid of the far left the moderate Democrats are afraid\nBecause they know the far left as the media mega fall [noise] and so there really isn't a well will laugh learned its lesson\nBecause the far left will never stop they want a fundamentally different America and the moderate less afraid of them so they're just gonna keep\nNot saying anything how many Democrats largely you hear stick up for the presumption of innocence and due process and the Kavanaugh situation\nI Am really can't think of a single one that did and I think I Would\nSay they're not and I researched it I researched it\nI uh I had my staff finally a Democrat and elected Democrat that sticking up for the presumption of innocence in America now you know there are plenty of them but they wouldn't say it because they're afraid of meat too\nThey're afraid of a Soros they're afraid of Schumer and so they say nothing\nLet's talk about killing and that's what you\nHave and I think independent Americans are getting that maybe they're not getting it the way I laid out for you but they're saying you know there's something wrong you know and I think that will show up in three weeks\nShould've innocence and due process and the Kavanaugh situation\nI actually can't think of a single one that did and I think I\nMean they're not on it and I researched it I researched it\nI uh I had my staff find me a Democrat and elected Democrats that's sticking out for the presumption of innocence in America now you know there are plenty of them but they wouldn't say it because they're afraid of meat to\nThey're afraid of a Soros they're afraid of humor and so they say nothing\nLet's talk about killing and asked what you\nHave and I think independent Americans are getting that maybe they're not getting it the way I laid out for you but they're saying you know there's something wrong and I think that'll show up in three weeks I I Believe\nI well I Hope you're right let's talk about killing the says the hunt for the worst war criminal history\nOkay um the book is about evil\nAnd I wrote the book off killing hat and which is a fantastic success and thank you for pointing out that the killing series though this is the eighth won the first seven have Seventeen million copies in print\nThe most successful non fiction book series of all time in the first six days out killing the ss sold a hundred and forty thousand copies so there's something going on here and\nWanting to garden I write history in a way that is compelling you can't put the book down and we've always done that were killing me a sense about evil and my contention is that Americans\nMany of us don't understand true we even we don't we look away from it so a guy walks into a high school he shoots down a dozen kids skills um thousands of people are shot in the city of Chicago by drug gangs clerics molest\nChildren those are all evil acts but many of us are going to look away well it's just on the news\nThey don't understand that there's evil all around them and perhaps the most evil people ever walked the earth were\nHitler's henchmen BSS who were in the concentration camps and we tell their story how many of them got away because people like the red cross the American CIA elements of the Catholic Church help them help them get away\nCan you believe in you know\nAnd then they had to be tracked down by very brave people because Odessa and notice it contains a two letters as as they ... murder you if you will look into these people these ss or on the run would kill you\nNever claim that the earth that it you know under under law to based on some flimsy excuse like that and I think she's got she's got problems\nDo you think the Boston Globe is in her corner they originally reported or that it was one five twelve at the foreign and then they had to issue a correction today and say you said it's been may not be one five twelve to maybe one one thousand and twenty fourth um\nWhy are they willing to play along with this game when they know that as you pointed out for employment law and he he does see you know equal Employment Opportunity commission that none of this stuff even matters because it wouldn't hold up for those standards which are the standards of government a government that you may want to you know someday be president of the government\nThat's right the Boston Globe dating back to two thousand and twelve has essentially served as Elizabeth Warren's press office they did this back into two thousand and twelve what she does she gives them exclusive access to family members exclusive access to\nDocuments and they run with her story line and they did it back in two thousand and twelve and they've done it multiple times in the last three to four months as she's getting ready to run so with the Boston Globe didn't do here is what a responsible news organization would do they would have\nFirst of all reviewed her actual DNA gate and not just their report someone she hired concluded they would have taken that data to another genealogist to another scientist who familiar with DNA and whatever verified this person's finding there's no indication they did that they simply took off the shelf\nReport she commissioned and she obtained which even on its face is almost laughable that she might be one one thousand Native American based on a DNA database which doesn't even include Native Americans in it and this is is really preposterous in the\nIn the issue becomes why did she do this and we know the reason she did it she didn't claim to be Native American when she was a child\nShe didn't claim to be Native American and she applied to college or law school it was only in her mid to late thirties when she was climbing do law professor ladder from University of Texas all the way up to Harvard law school that\nShe listed herself as being Native American it was known she listed herself for Yossi filing purposes that way and lo and behold when she finally get tenure at Harvard law school essentially the top alone on a ladder\nYou can't go any higher than that uh she stopped supporting herself as Native Americans\nAnd Hershey good high right there at that point well now do you see this creating a real problem for her because as much as I think she's been a punchline nachos for conservatives but even for the president of the United states um and now having dumped this additional piece of it is no well I can show this one one thousand but now you have to\nAnd when she applied to college or law school it was only in her mid to late thirties when she was climbing the law professor ladder from University of Texas all the way up to Harvard law school that\nShe listed herself as being Native American it was known she listed herself for each Yossi filing purposes that way and lo and behold when she finally get tenure at Harvard law school essentially the top ... on a ladder\nYou can't go any higher than that uh she stops supporting herself as Native Americans\nAnd Hershey good high right there at that point well now\nDo you see this creating a real problem for her because as much as I think she's been a punch line not just for conservatives but even for the president of the United states um and now having dumped this additional piece of it is no well I can show this one one thousand but now you have to believe me\nIt almost seems to me that there's going to make her more of a punch line there are folks who are the dressing that Donald Trump would promised a million dollars if you could prove to his Native American ought to send one one thousand and twenty fourth of a million dollars to Elizabeth Warren and say OK bet settled\nAnd the Cherokee Nation issued a statement late today complaining and lame fasting car and saying quote Senator Warren\nIs undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage close quote and they then go on to say that you cannot use DNA as a test it died demeaning to Native Americans there's a lot more to tribal membership in tribal inclusion than DNA\nAnd the DNA is totally inappropriate to use for their purposes and they don't use it and so what she has done is she has created to think she thought she was going to settle this problem instead she'd make made herself laughing stock\nAnd two she is actually forced Native American and this is the unofficial tribal statement from the Cherokee Nation saying that she is undermining their interest by or continue continued claims of tribal heritage so I think she made her situation a lot worse\nThan it was the question I've always had for her which is we know what happened here\nShe tried to cheat you try to rig the system for herself why doesn't she just apologize what is the personality\nProblem that she has that she will not simply apologize and\nI get a lot of her supporters like her policies okay it's kind of left wing politics and they're willing to excuse\nThe with very few people I Believe actually believe her when she says these things that may be willing to excuse it if they like or politics but I don't think anybody believes her and I think what she doesn't realize is people are laughing at her not with her\nAnd what she has done here with is ludicrous DNA test she should've come out and said I had my DNA tested\nIt's such a miniscule\nFraction at at you know one one thousand\nYou know I really never should have claimed that I didn't know this before but now I Do apologize to the Cherokee people and to other Native American it would've created a little bluster for a week or two but you know what it would have served are much better I think people have to ask why won't she just apologize\nAnd it's got to be an ego problem because professor Jacob's and from a legal interaction you know William Americans in amazingly forgiving country when I've seen politicians have the guts to actually apologize she won't do it and sadly I think she's going to pay for it

celebrated victory on Twitter reading first transgender woman world champion ever allowing biological males who identify as transgender women to compete in women's athletic events\nHas been a controversial subject I Would say so here's my thought on it if you encourage your son and your daughter to take part in sports I think that's a good thing I don't think it's the be all and end all but it's a good thing to do\nHowever how are you going to encourage your daughters to go out and play in any of those sports where they may end up competing against somebody who is a biological mail\nNow imagine if your daughter plays tennis how would she play\nAgainst somebody with the muscle structure and the height and the muscle advantage of a biological male how would\nFor example I don't golf but I Know enough about it to know that the women's tea is different than the men's T Y because in general male golfers can hit the ball farther so they set the tea a little farther back for them\nHow's your daughter going to compete in golf against somebody who plays golf but has the muscles of somebody born a man and is that a fair competition we've brought it up on this show in regards to wrestling\nIn regards to a lot of other sports in which muscles may make some of the difference is it legitimate to allow somebody born a male to compete as a female\nAnd in this case how would you feel if you were one or the other two women who finished second and\nHow would she play against somebody with the muscle structure and the height and the muscle advantage of a biological male how would\nFor example I don't golf but I Know enough about it to know that the women's tea is different than the men's team why because in general male golfers can hit the ball farther so they

of Americans for tax reform\nAnd I don't think anybody likes paying taxes but I pay when I'm legally required to pay rubber it won't surprise you that some of my listeners have been paying way too much attention to the New York times story about Donald Trump and his taxes and how much the state of his father paid in taxes because\nApparently a daddy Trump managed to figure out ways to or that the IRS signed off on there were a legitimate way to transfer of wealth for themselves to his kids can can you fault him for something like that\nAt absolutely not for starters Seventy percent of Americans for decades\nAs a supported the idea of a polishing the death tax that it's an unfair attack they pay taxes several times you pay taxes when you are you saying that but that's\nJust stupid enough to die they want to take ... so this is a tax most Americans have wanted to get right up for a long time Republicans came close to getting rid of it under Trump is still there are a little bit uh\nBut what outrages me is that somebody in the IRS leak this you know uh yeah somebody's tax structure I I'm kinda concerned that if we trust the Iraq for that personal data that air taxes that for political reasons it might get\nShared a that quite sure what the ... when that happens\nFor starters Seventy percent of Americans for decades has a supported the idea of polishing the death tax that it's an unfair tax you pay taxes several times you pay taxes when you are you saying that but that's\nJust stupid enough to die they want to take half so this is a tax most Americans have wanted to get rid of for a long time the Republicans came close to getting rather than under Trump is still there are a little bit uh\nBut what outrages me is that somebody in the IRS leaked is you know uh yeah somebody's tax structure as I'm I'm kinda concerned that if we trust the IRS for that personal data that air attacks is that for political reasons that might get\nShared a not quite sure what\nThe ... when that happens politically member a Nixon after he lost a Kennedy was audited for the next eight years and both Obama and Clinton politicized the IRS I served on the commission or to look at the IRS during the Clinton years I was a Republican appointee and uh\nI heard many conservative groups Heritage Foundation citizens against government waste other groups\nWere harassed by the IRS I talked to my left of center friends to see if you know maybe they're going after all the the larger ... none of the left groups were a hit by that and I asked the head of the IRS who testified before our commission or its congressional presidential commission and\nI said look ah\nMy conservative friends are being harassed and they've gone after for no reason not to get out on the left this is not happening what's going on they said no it's got to a very even handed a way we look at it as I said well explained it to us and they said no it's a secret you're not really\nThat that was yeah that really you'll have to trust and uh and then a ... a B or then senator from Nebraska said okay we've really exhausted this subject to talk about something else he was the Democrat Senator\nYou know I don't think we've exhausted at all I in fact Grover I've told people on the air listeners they'll say well why didn't ... release his tax returns I said you know\nThere are people who would sooner share their home address with you or their cell phone number or the email address then they would tell you how much they make what their paycheck is and to know somebody is taxes you'd have to end up knowing not only how much they make but how much they take home\nAnd what they did not like Hillary Clinton famously deducting charitable donations of her husband bills underwear and things like that\nUm well let's talk about something a little more serious there is an analysis that you've done is president of Americans for tax reform about who actually pays the taxes and I think this may surprise a few people who does pay the bulk of America's taxes right now\nWell on income taxes about three percent pay the top fifty percent um it's the top fifty percent pay almost a hundred percent of the income tax or get extremely progressive uh and uh the number of people\nWho are paying the taxes are shrinking a number now all Americans pay some taxes that's why\nA lower income people they they're particularly badly hit by cigarette taxes the our taxes property taxes sales taxes so nobody nobody goes through like an skate rather for Democrats think they can tell people I'm going to make people pay for it\nLower income people are smarter than that they know they have the taxes they pay and if they think about it they know that when the grocery store pay property taxes they pay for it when they buy eggs and del ... at the grass\nWell on income tax is about three percent pay the top fifty percent um it's the top fifty percent pay almost a hundred percent of the income tax or get extremely progressive uh and uh the number of people\nWho are paying the taxes are shrinking a number no all Americans pay some taxes that's why\nA lower income people they they're particularly badly hit by a cigarette taxes the our taxes property taxes sales taxes so nobody nobody goes through like an skate this the Democrats think they can tell people I'm going to make other people pay for it\nLower income people are smarter than that they know the heavy taxes they pay and if they think about it they know that when the grocery store pay property taxes they pay for it when they buy eggs and del ... at the grocery store or the grocery store doesn't have any money it doesn't get customers and every tax dollar\nThat a grocery store pays in property taxes\nAre in sales taxes in a income taxes to their workers that fall come straight out of the customers\nHave pockets so everybody gets hit with the idea that the rich are paying anything and they could pay more we actually I was just looking at church today the United states has the most progressive of overall tax structure of all the major uh companies countries more than Europe\nYou know all the countries you think of as very socialist and so on ours is very scared and we ought to be reducing taxes on every one set of playing this game about you know as person seems to have all ten fingers let's take one how about you know\nNot worrying about how everybody's doing just let's get taxes lower on everyone\nWell and rover he he you know nobody would run their own life has its way when I see the numbers you have the the top fifty percent of taxpayers the top income earners paying Ninety seven percent of the bill and the other half pay three percent I I tell people imagined\nYou go to dinner with ten family members and one night you decide to do something different you say let's have all the people at this table all you know cousins or nephews or uncles or whatever\nWill see the five highest paycheck folks at one end of of a long table and we'll put the other five people at the other end of the table and then when the bill comes if the bill I don't think you could feed you know ten people for a hundred dollars a month so you could just make the map easy\nWhen bill comes for a hundred dollars the people at the rich under the table will pay Ninety seven dollars and the other five people or the other end to pay three bucks can you imagine doing that\nTo your family one night how long would it take for probably at least one end the ... the wealthier end to object to that kind of arrangement\nYeah since it's one of the things that's very important to the left has to constantly say\nThat a higher income people middle income people aren't paying their fair share this because you can think that somebody is the government can get more money for free out of nowhere a instead of understanding that that a higher income people pay a great deal of taxes as it is um because the tax code is\nComplicated and because they're trying to squeeze more and more money out there like to hide how much it's hitting you and where are\nThere are problems in that it's too complicated we should go to a lower and simpler\nTax structure ah I grew up in Massachusetts we had a flat rate 'em as it is five and a quarter a\nFlat rate income tax in the very liberal blue Democrats Massachusetts the idea that we should have been graduated a progressive income tax which Carl Marx lights at night yeah I'm not sure I like it or in Massachusetts five times\nPaying their fair share of its edge because you can say that somebody can get more money for free out of nowhere instead of understanding this high income people pay a great deal of taxes as it is um because the tax code is\nComplicated and because they're trying to squeeze more and more money out there like a high how much it's hitting us where\nThere are problems in that it's too complicated we should go to a lower and simpler\nTax structure uh I grew up in Massachusetts where a flat rate um just five and a quarter a\nFlat rate income tax and the very liberal Democrat in Massachusetts the idea that we should have graduated it for granted that income tax which Carl Marx like at night yeah I'm not sure I like it or in Massachusetts five times the law has put on the ballot let's go to a progressive her graduate income tax like the federal one\nFive times Massachusetts says about it\nBecause they realize that if you can get by the taxpayers into different groups and they each pay different right they'll get one at a time\nWhen you get a lower income people are raised in the middle of them are on the back and forth constantly be changing all week for you know but if it's just so hot and then the Kennedy can stand your neighbors kept all outrage anybody's taxes\nI think that's a great way to go Grover Norquist is president of Americans for tax reform reform a rubber thanks for the time by the way\nYou know what's

A. R. S. zipper tutor dot com slash Mars except for could really is the smartest way to hire\nYou are listening to the Lars Larson show\nMore losses show\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I think it's remarkable is at the experts told us that this was the new norm that this one to one and a half percent annual growth was what we were going to have to be resigned to live with as a tour western advanced economies and then along comes truck and it\n... it was amazing to me it is it wasn't even just the new policies the deregulation of cutting the red tape and eventually the tax cut it was the expectation that no longer have the federal government\nPiling regulation upon regulation on American business things like the clean Power Plan and so you see this manufacturing boom start this very moment that Trump won election in November of two thousand sixteen because the economy the business people knew that it was going to be a different day\nAnd I believe that to your point at these policies been pursued earlier we would have a much larger and more vibrant economy today\nYou know it's funny I'm Talking to attractive or who's vice president of the national of natural initiative for the Texas Public policy foundation all of that Keynesian economics gee if we just pile a bunch of money out there will prime the pump and get the engine of the economy going again\nDo the folks who push those kinds of policies now see that they didn't work\nThat having all that cheap money out there didn't mean anything if somebody wasn't taking advantage of it and the reason they weren't taking advantage of it is that they had the expectation that they're going to have more regulations and limitations piled on top of them and the minute Trump came into office as you say\nBusiness began to react so there were folks out there in the economy who knew the moment he was elected that this was going to be the result and yet all the reporters who covered the race did not seem to know it which kind of suggests

violence and then they go oh the Republicans are going alone we got to go lower\nPretending like we're the ones that are starting stuff and we're the ones that are being violent and acting like Trump made it up\nThat they're acting like mob rule\nI think that you know it's just another towns where you know we're living in an Arab deception I did all the time you know I get so much hatred of people

advantage\nUnits are you off of social media to speak and to lose in the culture wars destroy finally conservatives are getting involved in the culture war\nConservatives libertarians are finally starting to push back and so now they don't know what to do because for the longest time we just took it and say okay and so while they just lowly took way this country whether it be the schools you know the um the media Hollywood all that stuff and now they have this weird movement\nFor freedom that completely taken over especially the years and people are loving it and people are inspired

something from that if you look at people\nWeren't willing there's a lot of people that are willing to believe for this movement that within the police for freedom but the other side they're not willing to believe because it's for selfish reasons why they do what they do that's why they're so selfish they're not even willing to show their face severe effects for their movement that's how selfish they are\nYou just get on the global or send their menus are not willing to bleed and that's why they're going to lose\n... because if you've got spirit and you know you're doing it for the

American does Elizabeth Warren having her it's what everybody's talking about\nSo we gotta talk about it and so I went into the Tonight Show figuring my God that's where all the conservative talk radio was talking about\nHow much of a Pocahontas was Elizabeth Warren and what's Trump have to say about it because he's always got something goofy to say about it but I just decided about a half hour ago I don't got the stomach to talk about it it's stupid and it's unimportant I\nI mean here we are and and I guess the the the poetry right the symmetry which beautiful\nBecause this afternoon before I went on the air\nWe found out that for this past fiscal year that just ended September thirtieth uh we've hit the highest federal budget deficit\nThat we've had in six years seven hundred and

Walsh Monday by the way Devon thank you for the medical Monday shout out\nJust another manic Monday so love that show hey ah the reporting today on Jamal could show me the\nA Saudi Arabian dissident and journalist who is presumed dead\nOr the reports today are that Saudi Arabia is going to fess up to it Saudi Arabia is as we speak preparing a report\nIn which they will admit\nOr that Jamal could show me\nThe Washington Post columnist\nA long time Saudi Arabia journalist who went missing earlier this month\nSaudi Arabia is prepared to admit\nIn fact they're preparing a report to publicly admit that he was killed in quote and interrogation that went wrong you'll recall that could show the went into the the shoddy consulate in Turkey are never to be seen again\nI'm back on October second not Turkish officials\nHave said pretty conclusively\nThat they've got proof\nThat show was murdered and then dismembered by a team of Saudi agents or that is a charge that the Saudi Government vehemently denies but\nI'm multiple reports out today\nOr that Saudis are are going to admit\nThat they killed him but it was an accident\nThey're going to admit that they intended to duct and then bring to show the back to Saudi Arabia\nBut that loop\nSaudi consulate in Turkey are never to be seen again\nI'm back on October second not Turkish officials\nHave said pretty conclusively\nThat they've got proof\nThat could show he was murdered and then dismembered by a team of Saudi agents or that is a charge that the Saudi Government vehemently denies but\nI'm multiple reports out today\nOr that Saudis are are going to admit\nThat they killed him but it was an accident\nThey are going to admit that they intended to of duct and then bring show he back to Saudi Arabia\nBut that who she was inadvertently killed or during that interrogation process\nClearly this public whitewashing\nIs intended to what\nAbsolve the Saudi Government from purposely going out of their way to murder a journalist and murder a dissident\nAnd they're just going to basically say it was an accident\nI Would suspect that this report will be made public later tonight or sometime tomorrow earlier today President Trump said\nThat he had spoken with the Saudi king who told him that uh they had no knowledge\nThe Saudis had no knowledge\nOf what happened to show me at all Trump also came out and said you know maybe a\nMaybe a show he was killed by some four hundred pounds fat guy in his basement no I'm just kidding about that that was the Russia investigation Trump said this morning that maybe could show he was killed by quote role weed killers\nWhich is nonsense\nAnd it's all nonsense\nOr this is what Saudi Arabia does\nThey killed dissidents and they killed journalist and could show be was a journalist who was hugely\nCritical of the Saudi regime\nNow the only point I'll make here and then I Love your your feedback if you want to weigh in here\nThree one two six for two fifty six hundred the only point I'm going to make is\nLook Donald Trump has bent over backwards ever since the story broke\nThis story that the Saudi Government\nBasically a a a called for a hit\nA murder of one of their journalists over dissidents or Donald Trump has bent over backwards from the beginning of the story not to offend the Saudis\nAnd all I'm saying this Trump is no different than Obama before him\nThen George W. Bush before him\nThan Bill Clinton before George W. Bush than George W. Bush before Bill Clinton American presidents going all the way back man they bend over in bend over and bend over so as not to offend the Saudis\nFor political reasons for business reasons\nSo don't don't tell me Trump's any different here he's doing the same damn thing Obama they're\nWhat the Saudi Arabia has done here\nLess of a dissident a Donald Trump has bent over backwards from the beginning of the story not to offend the Saudis\nAnd all I'm saying this Trump is no different than Obama before him\nThan George W. Bush before him\nThan Bill Clinton before George W. Bush than George W. Bush before Bill Clinton American presidents going all the way back man they bend over in bend over and bend over so as not to offend the Saudis\nFor political reasons for business reasons\nSo don't don't tell me Trump's any different here he's doing the same damn thing Obama did\nWhat the Saudi Arabia has done here is despicable but again this is who is it this is this is the part of what Islam is missing Islam isn't right this is a brutal brutal or a or a regime\nA dictatorial regime\nOr Saudi Arabia leads the planet in beheadings every year okay what they did because she'll be here they do all the time you don't have freedom in Saudi Arabia you can't speak up in Saudi Arabia it ... this is right this is just one more a\nIslamic one country\nThat is living in the seventh century it's not our job to change him it's not our job to reform them but beyond that strike be honest a Trump Obama Bush all of them just be honest right you're ignoring what Saudi Arabia has done\nA purely for business reasons just be honest about that\nThat's all let me go to Rick K Rick you're on with Joe\n...

now this group\nStarted out around just a few hundred people\nAre they all laugh San Pedro Sula\nOr a dangerous city in Honduras on friday\nThe caravan continued to expand as news of the caravan spread\nAnd organizer of this group of folks from Honduras said that\nThese migrants are are are going to walk up through Guatemala\nAnd then they're going to walk up through Mexico\nAnd their aim is

vote but only fifty five percent of Pinochet said they are almost certain to vote\nCould make a real difference because\nLatino vote Democrat not like blacks vote Democrat and oh by the way\nDemocrats are also concerned\nOr because\nThey just figure that\nLike blacks\nThey could get eighty to Ninety percent of Latinos to vote Democrat\nYou know Trump is\nIs such a racist they say and he's so

about your position with users\nSo I Am the ah local broker for them so I make sure all their accounts or a trained up and he's a good to go with the product correctly merchandise stolen the shelf\nAlright I'm you know let's just get right into the importance of college and I know that are a lot of people\nUh will come in and want to know what to do to help their hair skin and nails first of all and then joined the ligament owns a type of situation so was it so important for our customers that come in this or a two state college enjoys\nOkay so based on clinical studies um we have the highest level of ... in our body at about the age of twenty five\nAnd from that point on we lose about one percent a year\nCollege and is the largest natural protein of your body on so next to water it's the most abundant substance and your body\nOn you know and honestly a lot of people think of it as hair skin nails but it's in your heart your liver your lungs or prostate um you know it's an all your end of the ... tissues that line your veins and your arteries I'm In your bones your muscles it's absolutely everywhere so it's it's very big in debt forget to your body\nAnd you know again at twenty five we start losing about one percent and generally that's because we have hormonal changes whether our men and women at that time ... Strasse which obviously is a huge factor she told diet um their general lifestyle you\nKnow nutritional deficits ads oxidation all this stuff is taking place and it's lowering the production of college and in our bodies\nYes and then uh why should why should we add\nA college into our body at the age of twenty five and can we get ahead of the curve\nAnd uh you know maintain healthy her skin or nails and connect you to issue and you know it sounds like it's great for your arteries your heart or your veins everything in your body seems to benefit from college and uh should we continue on and and really you know\nTake all the callers and that we can take even at age twenty five\nYeah absolutely I mean I the only if you start out about the age of twenty five your going to be exactly what you said I had at the game so for those of us who didn't take it at twenty five you know there's good news that it's helpful at any age um but what what it's gonna do\nAnd it's lowering the production of college and in our bodies\nYes and then ah why should why should we had\nA college into our body at the age of twenty five and can we get ahead of the curve and uh you know maintain healthy you're gonna nails and\nTo not just you and you know it sounds like it's great for your arteries your heart or your veins everything in your body seems to benefit from college and uh should we continue on and and really you know\nTake all the callers and that we could even at age twenty five\nYeah absolutely I mean I the only if you start out about the age of twenty five you are going to be exactly what you've had a head of the game so for those of us who didn't take it at twenty five you know there's good news that it's helpful at any age\nI'm ... what what it's going to do is it's actually going to go into your body if you take it in the right for men to form that we use we use a ... college in and just say you know we source at from Brazil and France and then you add\nI'm real important that you don't want to get college in from China um just because it's not really clean it's adult traded um so we are we again we look for the premiums source but\nIn the right form so whether you take it in a powder or whether you take it in a tablet what it's going to do is it you're going to bring it into your body um and it's going to go to your bloodstream\nAnd within sixty minutes Ninety percent of that is absorbed into your body and the whole thing about college has it's going to go wherever it needs to go so if you have issues with your lung tissue it's going to go there if you have issues with your bones it's going to go there um it's kind of go wherever your body needs to have it\nAnd then it's also going to\nFlip the switch and it's going to help the production um it's going to\nWork with something called our fiberglass and we have fiberglass whether their muscles or in our skeletal tissue wherever it is it's going to kind of flip that switch and it's kind of fell apart tell our body to start making more college and\nUm so it's it's a great thing because once you take it and it's absorbed it's cumulative so and this day in your body for up to two weeks\nIt's functioning so as you take it it's kinda like investing and I used to say a bank account but you don't really make any money in a bank account\nMaybe more as a baby a long time ago [laughter] that's so sad\nAnalogy so let's say you invested in something like Amazon you know when you bought your stock and it's gonna be cumulative so if you don't take ah the you know you're you're um\nYou know the money that you make out it's kind of keep building on that and that's how college in works once you start taking it's going to continue to build and your body on and you're going to see the benefits\nOf that over a period of time\nYou're you briefly mentioned on your ... very important for supplementation uh can you tell us why is the source is so important to make you stand out of the premier college in products on her show\nMhm so you know like ... not all the colleges are like and there's lots of college and and new ones coming to the market daily because it's such a hot item now and people recognize how important it is but if\nYou want to make sure you're you're taking it from a very clean source and again we we source from Brazil France and the U.S and we do not support from China if you ... college in from China for an example it has kind of in a different\nSet to it and it also can't be real fine they can't be put through that same ... process and I'm sure you've spoken many times that a supplement is only as good as a as its absorption into your body so if you take college and that is from a source\nYou stand out as the premier college in products on our shelves\nMhm so you know like ... not all the college in front of like and there's lots of college and and new ones coming to the market the LA because it's such a hot item now and people recognize how important it is but if you want to make sure you're you're taking it from a very clean source\nAnd again we we source from Brazil France and the U.S and we do not have sorts from China if you force college in from China for an example I had kind of in a different set to it and it also can't be ... fine they can't be put through that same ... process and I'm sure you've spoken\nMany times that a supplement is only as good as a\nAs its absorb sent into your body so ... if you take college and that is from a source that can't be fully hides allies refined and the small molecule five ... ... it's not going to absorb into your body so war we do that does make a stand out as we again premiums source\nWe put it through this all hide civilization process and all that means is basically just chopping it up into these little tiny peptides that are pre digest then\nAnd then we'll go right into your system and start\nYou know your body can use it right away they'll\nAll right a user product right here at healthy habits six zero to nine or seventh street are websites H H H roots dot com for people that like to look at websites and of course a four year series we'll just that website it is a little different\nUm it is use theory dot com ... age you are one dot com WWW dot ... dot com and of course uh we have tablets and we have powder\nAround here a healthy habits different ways to take this product can you tell us why someone would censor tablet or powder or religious preference\nI think it says preference um you know it really doesn't make a difference in both cases you're getting six thousand milligrams or six grams of college and which is a protein so you're adding six grams of protein to your body\nThe other thing you're getting as um vitamin savory types and then I said I mentioned earlier which is in all of our products in the new vitamin stay for that\nTransaction to take place where you're actually creating a college in in your body on and I again I think it's a personal preference I mean I I personally find I use whatever whatever the hair would every time I just most importantly is that people take it and that's our compliant that they stick with it\nUh some people cannot do tablet cut off so they they can ... you know the powders real easy you can put in coffee whereas shaky can actually make a you know you can make an an Arnold Palmer with iced tea and lemonade and no vodka and college and then it it's delicious so\nYou kind of you can be creative you can put it in food as well you can actually cook with it on and there's lots of recipes on life for that\nOkay so little baking can happen and ah\nThat'd be a great way to get your college and also uh the powder is a vanilla flavored so I can see that that would be a very tasty things at your dream dream mhm or smoothie I outlined to make movies yeah absolutely it's very easy to take no another issue is I'm In\nSo yes we know are we\nTalking about lady taking TV only or should we get these men to take college into\n[laughter] [noise]\nIs this one me do you want me to go to the stress your anybody you're the guy on the panel Lucas\nAny any a man or woman can take college in obviously a women have the\nKind of you can be creative you can play them say that while it can actually cut back on and there's lots of rapidly than like\nOK so little baking can happen and ah\nThat'd be a great way to get your college and also uh the powder is a vanilla flavor so I can see that that would be a very tasty things at your dream dream mhm or smoothie I outlined many yeah absolutely it's very easy to take now another issue is a man\n... yes we know are we talking about lady taking college in only or should we get these men that take college into\n[laughter] [noise] is this one may do you want me to\nCome to this show is your anybody you're you're the guy on the panel here Lucas\nYeah any any a man or woman can take college and obviously a women have the\nAllure of the beauty part the hair skin to nails are but a man should take it too it's great for their joints or it's going to help if they work out and that's gonna help with information with their sleep so I mentioned definitely definitely take college and even if college in is maybe close to the women section or that should not scare them they should still pay\nBack oh great okay what are wondering what happens [laughter] ah\nYeah you're right Lucas we should not be afraid of a product of setting a close to the lady section or there's many many supplements that are easily cross over or even if it has ladies on it the men can take it and pretty much the same uh\nFor the ladies out there too and had the man's on it they can probably take products anyhow so it's definitely in that we all should be taking everybody men and women of course I'm\nJoyce mentioned twenty five this kind of the spot in your life where you're going to start decreasing\nWhat about if you're a teenager or young adult at is very very active would it be something that they should use the supplementation\nWell you'd theory a definitely markets to adults are so I uh we don't want to say that uh kids could take it with that said if I had a teenager I Would be perfectly fine giving him\nA college and you know kids can do bone brought they can do all different types of college and so so taking a college in supplement uh is is generally not a problem but as a company\nOr we are for adults so\nHealthy house call Arizona's not popular live on this talk radio show today by healthy habit healthy

S.\nWell does that homeland security right\nRight the homeland security is responsible customs and border patrol which is where this project actually laws and we know that delivery money into the general treasury does nothing because that's where the Mexico reimbursements will go that's where every ... or if we can think of all go in Congress just roll appropriate if you're just so we had to go past that\nWow so smart or you guys listening out there you can reach Clinton and his group at ... dot com by the way they do take bitcoin at this point and uh on Twitter at a bond that wall right at on Twitter okay now\nIt just in a very interesting ways it so you went to a round the IRS approved the it was pretty simple right because that's all tax donations correct\nYeah tax deductible okay are you listening to that crypto world so even if they get back when it's all tax deductible right correct okay so is it ... ... do you know if it's tax da da da da da ... ... or what they paid for it and this is a well\nWhat happens is that the converse of dollars immediately because we can't speculate with the investor the donors' money so it can be expected dollars as of the exchange rate at the time that the transaction was completed\nGot it isn't that something or you listen to this so if you bought let's say bitcoin at uh six dollars like we did and now to sixty six hundred dollar sixty five hundred like it is Monday can you believe that we got into bitcoin when [laughter] dollars [laughter]\nAnd four dollars and one dollar\nAnd six pennies in that crazy in the fat little in the ... that fat little India he believe a fat little and they could actually make something that is often live oh boy we get that reservation over there I'm constantly\nArguments I wasn't an argument last night I don't want to be\nI'm I'm ...

Horace Silver is and it's sad\nAnd then I'm against them coming here but it's really sad to see people die out in the desert it's what you know people to bringing their kids over and walking him through that desert the craziest thing so if let's say\nThe um or if we say we build that wall in your opinion is that going to stop any of that\nWell again it's a combination of things so yes absolutely uh what was going to stop people from coming in areas where they're not supposed to be there um and as we've seen there are plenty of other ways technology to but\nAmerica doesn't have a sense that we've ... fix this problem that we've been making progress towards this problem I don't\nThink we're making the early ...\nExactly and so from the standpoint of getting building started in getting construction started we need to give America a sense that we're making progress toward studying this time and we're not generating new trains have Thirteen hundred people from Honduras walking northward stores our country because the borders of protection\nAnd that's what the American people need to know it's not just the Mexicans the Mexicans are the biggest\nSo to speak it from the Central American countries and and the um the people from the middle east there's thinking in like crazy because they look like Mexican\nAnd they look I mean that's just the way it is I'm not being prejudiced in any way the way it is but they're sneaking across the border like crazy scare the crap out of me that one of them is going to be a terrorist and we're going to add something bad happened out of it down the road sooner or later\nSo and this is what we need to be really clear about is that it's not only about illegal immigration it's about the drugs it's about special interest aliens like terrorists that are coming across the border to your point Bangladeshis are up hundreds of ... percent this year we've seen Ruth allow hundreds of limited time coming through Chinese nationals that are found out it's easier to come across the southern border right\nAnd there are what are they promised traders right there was the one of the biggest invaders the Chinese right\nWell they have the resources to put together you know trains or people in and significant operations there\nThat crazy yet they bought a radio station just south of the border and fifty thousand ... now we have a big radar here we have made the thousand want seven million people under our umbrella we have one of the biggest shows here in Arizona as far as audience why so I Hope they hear you by the way find low wall dot com\nHappen out of it down the road sooner or later\nSo and this is what we need to be really clear about is that it's not only about illegal immigration it's about the drugs it's about special interest aliens like terrorists that are coming across the border to your point Bangladeshis are up hundreds of ... percent this year we've seen Bruce ... hundreds of them at a time coming

wall but on the wall dot com so now your goal here is to raise how much\nSo this particular project that we're trying to fund is has a budget of Portland fifty million dollars is actually in Arizona on Goldwater\nRange there which ... so the border that extends south east from Uma foreigners and editor of sixty three mile stretch of\nSixty three mile stretch and that's what it would cost ... that's nothing compared to what we pay you know we pay what is it Fifteen billion dollars a year given welfare housing\nUm health care\nTo uh undocumented people it it just bugs the crap outta me Fifteen ten to Fifteen billion I get that number straight ten Fifteen billionaire I Know it's over ... billion a year just in Arizona\nWhy are we doing this when it only costs four hundred and eighty million or five hundred million or maybe a billion right to build the wall you so you are raised a hundred thousand now and the next phase of it is and can you do you have any idea of what kind of marketing you're putting out there to the world\nAbsolutely so as I mentioned we've got this initial trust your money we're going to be delivering it to just within a few weeks there will make a public event out of that so that all the contributors can see that the process is complete where people from ditch us on stage saying hey thanks for the check we're going to use this to build the wall\nYou tell us that going to be in advance so I could be the I'd love to be there as a as a representative of the media a student by the way we're ... and I didn't mean to cut you off but we're ...

we've talked about grass fed ... versus a farm raised hope about them when I was raised with antibiotics and ... clearly reading we really mean the whole raised with with or without the other way on\nThis is becoming quite a controversial topic so it's really important to address\nA lot of livestock are being fed on a daily basis antibiotics\nUm and the purpose of that um is primarily to stimulate growth because the more you can get me to grow more quickly so to speak become develop more quickly the quicker you could take it to market and make money mhm\nSo what's happening is because there are just so much antibiotics we've all been starting to hear about antibiotic resistance and this is kind of where it's starting\nSo the definition of antibiotic resistance is bacteria that causes infections becomes resistant to effects of medication designed to kill them\nSo what we're hearing about more and more is people are getting sick and there are superbugs that we can't kill\nSo they our bodies and the bodies of the animals and the ... the bodies of the bacteria in the animals are becoming more and more resistant so I have a couple of studies all I'd like to site so\nI'm a study in two thousand and one in the new\nEngland Journal of medicine showed that eighty percent of salmonella bacteria in supermarket ground beef was resistant to some antibiotics mhm [noise] another study in two thousand two suggested that some people caught resistant strains of salmonella from eating pork\nThat had been fed a specific type of antibiotic\nUm the FDA and this is another study the FDA estimates that the use of antibiotics and chicken\nAre directly lead to eleven thousand people catching intestinal diseases um from antibiotic ... resistant bacteria in Nineteen Ninety nine so\nThis is definitely becoming an issue and yes um antibiotics can be used to treat and they should be if the animal is sick because we don't want to eat right to have to get on almost go to the grocery store but\nI'm just to have it on a daily basis is kind of overkill and we're seeing a result of that\nDo the studies that you've you've talked about or any others in addition to that indicate how much of that type of uh meet the protein you the chicken or fish or whatever it is but you need to eat to to get that do get to resist soon so ... is it that much in their\nAntibiotic that first of all I guess maybe more importantly what are we getting better they get like a ...\nA great question okay\nSo let me answer that by\nSaying something to be ready I Know I yeah did\nYou know I was really interested because I have heard the hype that you're starting to hear also and I thought you know let me really great grilled down on this um because it's an important\nIssue well I'm just so they you know our entire show last week\nWhat's on the antibiotics sense oh God yeah I'm a ... I'm ... I'm Out here talking about those went down on me but the amazing yeah that would be fantastic\nSo you may already know some of this so eighty percent of all ...\nType of uh meet the protein you the chicken or fish or whatever it is that you need to eat to to get to do get to resist soon as the ... is it that much in their\nAntibiotic at first of all I just made me more importantly what are they getting better they get like a ... a\nLawyer or a great question okay so\nLet me answer that by saying I'm going to be ready I Know I yeah did you\nKnow I was really interested because I have heard the hype that you're starting to hear also and I thought you know let me really drill down on this um because it's an important issue well I'm just so they you know our entire show last week was on antibiotics\nSense oh my God yeah I'm a ... I'm ... I'm Out here talking about when they called me up the amazing yeah that would offend out there\nSo you may already know some of this so eighty percent of all antibiotics sold in the U.S are given to animals I was really stunned by the um ... um and most of these the purpose of the antibiotics primarily is to promote growth\nOr prevent disease so to answer your question there's a different rating so when we go to the store we we should be because we're educating ourselves we should be looking at labeling though one of the labels would be organic and what that means is\nThat animals um meat dairy poultry eggs they are not given any antibiotics of any mhm\nSo then why would you before you go on and why would ... you know if ... if I see some organic labels and then we also specify no antibiotics ever why would this new like they have to see those no because people don't know if you will\nBecause people don't know okay this is yeah a lot of people don't know which is why we're having this conversation yeah\nI Do a lot of educating I'm with my clients and new clients and a lot of people just don't know mhm\nUm then there's another category called raised without antibiotics okay so we were talking about a lot of animals are given daily antibiotics mhm some brands like Tyson and I'm Purdue are saying that they have no ... no antibiotics ever\nSo they may have a group of chickens that they start out with ... no antibiotics\nThere may be some that get sick and they need to be treated with antibiotics so they have to go in a different group\nAnd that group then\nBecomes\nA different group so they may be labeled\nKnow medically important antibiotics and what that means is okay they could still be using antibiotics but they're not medically important what is medically important mean those are ah antibiotics that are used for people actually do her okay so that answers your question\nUm so what it says directly is this means that antibiotic used to treat people such as ... ... and ...\nHave not been given to animals ... okay then there is yet another category\nAnd I'm going down this path for a reason\nI'm no critically important and ... so what that means is they've stopped using some of the medically important which are the ones used for people mhm and they could be using other\nAntibiotics and then there's another category that says no growth promoting antibiotics so\nAll they could be a biologist but not growth promoting it right [laughter]\nSo those would only be used to treat the sick animals in sickness and not being given on a daily basis for the purpose of growing bigger animal so the purpose of uh\nSuch as ... ... and ... have not been given to animals ... okay then there is yet another category\nAnd I'm going down this path for a reason\nI'm no critically important and ... so what that means is they've stopped using some of the medically important which are the ones used for people mhm and they could be using other\nAntibiotics and then there's another category that says no growth promoting antibiotics so\nAll they could be ... but not gross promoting it right [laughter]\nSo those would only be used to treat the sick animals in sickness and not being given on a daily basis for the purpose of\nGrowing bigger\nAnimal so the purpose of of the breeders to give the antibiotics in the first place is to just as a precaution against bacteria and my career out what happens\nIs if you are giving a daily dose of antibiotics as a precaution and I know you know need for it right\nIt's unnecessary and that's where we were getting the antibiotic had ribs added on to us well right through eating yeah well the antibiotic resistance yes is passed on to us yeah yes\nAnd do the little critters that are becoming resistant right so now we have all the staff resistant and all these situations because we have just over medicated the animals which we consume and we over medicate ourselves\nThe main differences is that it'd be interesting somebody's alter my listening well ... if I took a lot of ... maybe I can have a like be like a growth hormone right what does it seem to work their way with humans just you know just as a love these animals\nYeah so the reason I went down that path of saying there's this and all these different categories the net net is the easiest way to avoid antibiotics in\nThe meat and the protein types that we consume is state with organic organic by definition cannot have antibiotics\nSo that you guys world I'm assuming it was about assumptions that these things are somehow inspected or whatever it is yeah I Know that you're getting what you are you're you're the glue\nS. D. A. is on the hook\nYeah OK for doing these inspection so that brings us to our next question so explain why organic is important and why that imply impacts are scan\nOkay I got one more thought okay before the organic has it feeds into the organic and we just mentioned organic so in addition to using antibiotics\nFor growth hormones are for ... for gross we are also injecting animals or I'm putting pellets in the ear to induce growth in the animals so what we're doing is hormones are being given the animal is getting bigger\nOr producing more milk mhm and more money again it's a it's a money thing so\nI'm usually they're using a synthetic testosterone an estrogen in the ear\nI'm In the fifties and sixties for example um animals were actually being given D. E. S. and we also know when women were being given the U.S to prevent miscarriages the their offspring the baby's\nHuman babies um we're more prone than to cancer so we have to be really super careful we don't always know what the animals are being given and what that could mean long term but we do know is that\nThe animals so what we're doing is hormones are being given the animal is getting bigger or producing more milk mhm and more money again it's a it's a money thing so I'm usually they're using a synthetic testosterone an estrogen in the ear\nI'm In the fifties and sixties for example um animals were actually being given D. E. S. and we also know when women were being given ds to prevent miscarriages that their offspring the baby's\nHuman babies um we're more prone to cancer so we have to be really super careful we don't always know what the animals are being given and what that could mean long term but we do know is that\nYou know and one question are one thing I Want to add is in all of these things you know we hear about the benefits it's like OK dairy calcium you know um protein you know you need red meat for iron and things like that but people don't understand\nWhat lies behind that which is what you're saying in making really good choices for our bodies and our skin and you know great outcome\nYeah so I kind of really I've always been very interested in nutrition um but it kind of took me to the next level ... one day when I was stuffing a bunch of greens and my blender\nUm to make a smoothie and it dawned on me that they're sure could be a lot of pesticides in there and I might be thinking that I'm making a good decision to take care of myself but I really haven't drilled down deep enough\nTo make more Chavez insecticides right right yeah but it's like wow I'm you are what you eat so if I I'm\nJust a blender full of greens that are full of pesticide mhm how healthy is that for me so the conversation today is\nYes our body needs protein to rebuild itself at all levels but let's look at really what kind of meat we are purchasing and using our dollars wisely ... by the best quality that we we can possibly for a ...\nYeah that's kinda what that is so in relation to dairy the same conversation\nIs that we should be looking for labels that tell us non GMO organic no antibiotics no R B G H which is the ...\nGood decision to take care of myself but I really haven't drilled down deep\nEnough to make more showed up as a second size\nRight right yeah like like wow\nI'm you are what you eat so if I I'm just a blender full of greens that are full of pesticide mhm how healthy is that for me so the conversation today is\nYes our body needs protein to rebuild itself at all levels but let's look at really what kind of meat we are purchasing and using our dollars wisely ... by the best quality that we we can possibly for a ...\nYeah that's kinda what that is so in relation to dairy the same conversation\nIs that we should be looking for labels that tell us non GMO organic no antibiotics no R B G H which is the recovery and vine growth hormone which is what's given to ... to make them stimulating more milk\nAnd what I always tell people if you don't see that label but you see made in Ireland\nOr made a mentor ego cheese from Spain or um Goldberg cheese from Denmark right you [laughter] um so again the European Union does not allow this monkey business that we allow\nSo I always look for European cheese if I can find something that says organic or grass fed and P s just because it says um\nOrganic doesn't necessarily mean is rough bed rest finish mhm\nSo what I'm hearing as a kind of some road that piece of it when it comes to stuff coming out of the European Union whether it's governor I Do dumb or cheese or the ... or so forth you know the the labels you don't have to be concerned about the fine print right otherwise I think my microscope with me to\nIraq where ... you feel comfortable buying that absolutely right and reading the labels of some of those you still have ...\nYeah the domestic stuff you know I'm I'm not going to name names but the domestic stuff unless it's says all the thing all the disclaimer that we're being educated today on what to look for I I I recommend walking away ... you don't know what you're getting\nA little cheese on the other by some European I Know that Costco yo yo ... they all have yeah and you can find it in Europe so\n[laughter]\n\nI see it through they learned future you know illness from doubling [laughter] isn't it true that\nDrinking eight glasses now we've actually had on the show a several experts that have said even ten glasses of water every day I don't remember a coma for hydration\n[laughter] oh is that what do you think here's what I think and I'm a lot of a lot of practitioners [noise] um you take your body weight mhm divided by two right and that's how many ounces you shouldn't be drinking a day ... oh baseline\nBaseline do forget we live in Arizona yeah so in the summer we want that would increase the amount of and that was the thing yeah taken into consideration and they were exercising same thing we need to increase that amount but that's the baseline would have required body weight and rule of thumb wow All right\nSo for me with my body weight I should be eating drinking age don't eight ounces a classes eight glasses yeah that's that's me but you're a man and your bigger so you're half your weight is going to be not mine yeah you need to have more water\nSo the definition here was how many houses are the lessons right that's the

Arizona yeah so in the summer we want that one you know and that was and I think yeah taken into consideration and they were exercising same thing we do to increase that amount but that's the baseline\nBody weight it might be the rule of thumb yeah All right\nSo for me with my buddy wait I should be eating drinking and you don't need a class ... yeah that's that's me but you're a man and your bigger so you're half your weight is going to be not mine yeah so you need to have more water\nWas just so the definition here was how many houses are the glasses right that's [laughter]\n\nEight ounce glass [laughter] so um\nWhat's your ... you know what should we know as long as you're on the subject what should we know about keeping her skin hydrated K better hydrated art is maybe\nOur body needs to be hydrated not only with water but also with oil and buy oil I mean essential fatty acids and buy a central fatty acids I mean I'm the omega is that you get some fish\nAnd um because we get plenty of them may goes from the the vegetables that we eat mhm the um the not the grains the olive oil\nSo does that have to be actually internal it could also be oils that do you use a lot of a

James O'Keefe joins us to discuss Claire McCaskill\nHave you ever taken your car in for an oil change your mechanic find something wrong and surprise your hit with a huge repair bill and what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty you're paying out of your own pocket to fix it\nExcept she's been she was a rubber stamp on the previous administration and she's gotten a cert petition for a more progressive\nBut she tries to hide it from voters and she is struggling because Missouri state that went by Trump double digits in Missouri is the state where you have so many moderate Democrats blue collar Democrats voted for Trump\nAnd they're really disillusioned with ... with the Democrat Party and with people like McCaskill so she was very quiet if you notice she was very quiet on Kavanaugh she's been very quiet on gun issues she said very quiet on a lot of stuff well\nAt least publicly but she did talk to project very toss unknowingly because they were embedded within her campaign and it was very interesting I think it's for somebody is of Senator McCaskill that this was part of the the the Q and a that this undercover reporter had with her listen\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYeah and when she has but the thing that she's always kind of triangulate on is where she stands on quote unquote assault weapons 'cause she said before I supported assault weapons ban will remember that the go that's the word that they all use it to catch all phrase for some automatic firearms semi automatic rifles specifically but they would like all ... to be banned\nUh and so her staff are actually spoke to this uh in another video list\nLeast publicly but she did talk to project their ties unknowingly because they were embedded within her campaign and it was very interesting I think that the first time by ... of Senator McCaskill that this was part of the the the Q and a that this undercover reporter had with her listen\n\n\nYeah I'm On she had but the thing that she's always kind of triangulate on is where she stands on quote unquote assault weapons because she said before I support an assault weapons ban will remember that the go that's the word that they all use it to catch all phrase for some automatic firearms semi automatic rifles specifically that they would like all ... to be banned\nAnd so her staff are actually spoke to this or in another video listen\nI can tell them to go door to her [noise]\nBecause I wanted the mushrooms or semi automatic rifle\nMore soldiers were which is insane to me because when you look it up yeah uniformed crime reports from twenty to twenty sixteen it showed that hand feeding fits hurt more people three times over then some Adam ethic rifles but here we are\nO'Keefe with a project very tough action dot com where you can go and watch this ah undercover this extra day in full joins me now on the phone James always good to have your thanks for joining us\nJay data thanks for having me back again\nOf course so this is ... ... people know Claire McCaskill Senator McCaskill in Missouri very tough race\nOr she's actually being challenged and this is the closest that anyone has ever come from from from basically you know taking her out politically getting her seat\nAnd she'd been successful at it previously because she always presented herself in this moderate and she never on the big issues the hot issues that every other senator speaks on she seemingly incredibly quiet and ... and and your\nExpos day I'm actually kind of discovered why tell us about it\nWell Missouri Dana ... I Know that you're you're from Missouri Missouri is a special state because Democrats are more conservative they are more pro life they're more pro God and there was a shrinking base\nThat a clear as to appeal to so this video tape and side of her office shows her own staffers are saying they're for field coordinators talking about how she has to mislead voters\nUm she says of course when we asked her about gun bans we got clarification from her staff you've heard the sound bite their a semi automatic rifle ban another staffer Nick stole roast says that\nShe has the same policies as President Obama but she has to mislead she she says that people just can't know that she had the McCaskill Obama quote essentially have the same views on everything so there's this\nPattern in these red states Missouri being probably the strongest example or the Democrats have to live they have to mislead the voters because of the nature of the political dynamics and the state and that's what this videotape showed that shows all over staffers\nSaying well she's got this incremental approach she can't speak publicly about it this is what they're all saying behind closed doors one of the staffers actually says she has to essentially lie about everything wow\nYes she said that they ah what the video shows is that\nUh she still close with Obama that he can't come to Missouri to campaign for her otherwise it will\nAh make her look as though she's not a moderate it came out that she gets to take money from Planned Parenthood although they they don't publicize that they take money from a mom's demand and apparently moms demand that Bloomberg um astro turf gun control group comprised a lot of her staff\nHit us got Rob Mills who's one of the higher ups in our office says that she doesn't open ... support moms\nThey have to mislead the voters\nBecause of the nature of the political dynamics in that state and that's what this videotape showed that shows all of her staffers saying well she's got this incremental approach she can't speak publicly about it this is what they're all saying behind closed doors one of the staffers actually says she has to essentially lie about everything wow\nYeah she said that they and what the video shows is that\nUh she's still close with Obama that he can't come to Missouri to campaign for her otherwise it will\nAh make her look as though she's not a moderate it came out that she gets take money from Planned Parenthood although they they don't publicize that they take money from a mom demand and apparently mom demand that Bloomberg um astro turf gun control group comprised a lot of her staff\n[noise] hit us got Rob Mills who's one of the higher ups in her office says that she doesn't openly go support moms demand action because in this is a direct quote because quote it could hurt her ability to get elected Missouri and see that and they're like well I don't want to support or even though they stand for the same policies so you're talking about this incremental approach where she'll\nShe'll do it a little bit at a time and he said quote she's really good about strategy and making history as a goal and can get their\nUh she's worked out stuff with moms demand to make sure that she can support their goals without supporting organization openly and there's this pattern in in Missouri where the Democrats you know there still are I guess a very tiny pro life Democrat community it's shrinking because most of those folks have have chosen to become Republicans\nBut they're they're still she's still trying to\nLike she has to lie to half of the people and then be honest with the other half and that's what this reporter so damning about because it just blows it all open there's a Greek chorus of\nPeople in our office all saying the same thing on all the issues Obama guns and Planned Parenthood there's even a thing about impeachment where we ask this this staffer Glenn Winfrey is the staffers and it was just so tell us about ... plans to impeach truck\nAnd she she goes we the staffer says we're going to tell the moderates to quote get over it\nOnce we pull a bait and switch on them you know so it's just all across the board inside of our office\nWow yeah and that and that was pretty I thought that was fascinating as well like get over it and that's what moderate\nDefinitely should pay attention to she's focusing on all of the things ultimately\nThat add costs Hillary Clinton the election and it's you know it's difficult for her because it is very much it's a Trump state\nUm a lot of Democrats voted for Trump and they're pretty please me look at approval ratings and his approval ratings are in Missouri they're pretty pleased with what he's been doing and what it means for you know the manufacturing in that state um that I I I had she responded as to the\nUh they can ... I guess is she can tend to allow her staff to talk for her\nUh all in all of a moderate to\nIs the question I I was in Columbia yesterday Columbia, Missouri and I did talk to the next arose to walk down the street to his office and I do or stop them with a with a camera on my shoulder and a microphone I said ... what why aren't you honest with people and he said I Can't another authorized to speak to the press\nAnd that kind of felt proud because I kind of felt like say well Nick they don't consider me a journalist so maybe you can talk to me but he did not talk to me I did get a comment from Josh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate he's tweeted the video out twice and they usually what happens data\nHas happened in Tennessee is that that first they'll they'll try not to talk about it and then there'll be this bubbling critical mass grounds falling from the grassroots it'll go on local TV\nOne of the local reporters last Claire and she'll have to fumble and bumble that's typically how this stuff goes because there's nothing for her to say all of her staff are calling her lie or what is she going to do fire all of her staff will\nThere be honest with you the staffer are being honest there they're on\nMissouri and I did talk to this next arose to walk down the street to his office door stop them with a with a camera on my shoulder and the microphone I said look you know what why aren't you want us to people in these so I Can't another authorized to speak to the press\nAnd I kind of felt proud because I kind of felt like say well Nick they don't consider me a journalist so maybe you can talk to me but\nHe did not talk to me are we did get a comment from Josh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate he tweeted the video out twice and they usually what happens data has happened in Tennessee is that that first they'll they'll try not to talk about it and then there'll be this bubbling critical mass ground swelling from the grassroots it'll go on local TV\nOne of the local reporters last clear and she'll have to fumble and bumble that's typically how this stuff goes because there's nothing for her to say all of her staff are calling her lawyer what is she going to do fire all of her staff will\nThere be honest with you the staffer are being honest there they're on unbeknownst to them they're whistle blowers and they're being very honest and forthcoming about what she stands for so it'll be interesting to see the local TV stations in Missouri ask the questions\nYeah I Would I think that Missouri voters would like to I think everybody would like to know where she stands on it because she it's weird she'll be very vocal about weird things and then she goes and hides when it gets really tough so uh we'll see we'll reach out to her too although I don't think she will ever come on\nBut uh well if we can yet we've reached out to our repeatedly she hates me so I got you got more from her than any other than any other journalists get\nProject very ties action dot com and I've tuned it out the video as Well James O'Keefe we're going to follow this closely because we'd love some clarification from Senator McCaskill as always thanks for joining us\nThank you so much\nI Would love to see I'm just very curious and and did you hear and then the video too if you watch it the staffer said oh yeah we got a lot of them I'm Jim

is trying to import\nUh or export from New York end of the state New York style gun control meaning in New York say fact they're going to the state's going to make sure you store things the way the state wants it to et cetera et cetera\nUh but uh and and she's not vocal about it because it will cost her with voters\nSo voters in the state especially the more moderate ones\nYou know the only to figure out sort of where you you guys are going to be going with this ah because she looks like she had been on the up and up with you\nI Will reach out for clarification as well we have more to come

evidence the records that I was posted in my blog are evidence\nShe her family is always found in the United states records\nAs free white citizen of the United states they are absolutely never found in Cherokee Nation records ever\nLogic tells us\nHer ancestors were not Cherokee\nRehab citizens who actually have less\nIndian blood\nFor their CD I'd be\nAnd Elizabeth Warren's DNA test\nSuggests she might have ... different has those people\nCan prove that they have the right to be citizens of our you know Cherokee Nation\nThrough documentation their ancestors were always there\nSo you know we eat we have some citizens who have no Indian blood we look back at the Friedman their citizens of the Cherokee Nation\nBecause we adopted them as citizens just like the United states adopted its corners places citizens we would never you know they they don't have the American DNA there in Ohio measure for American DNA it's the same for for Cherokee citizenship\nWar and um I think this is probably the most damaging thing she could have done for Indian sovereignty\nAnd and it seems as there was a a a really awesome opportunity that could've prevented presented itself to learn more about it that was lost when she doubled down and you even made mention of this before I don't know why in the world\nShe just didn't say you know I had heard stories grown up they turned out not to be true I Apologize for that\nAnd and then ... and you know apologize and moved on and said of doubling down and tripling down and then coming out you know with the big grandiose announcement with his DNA tests and doing the video and everything that help them nothing that just as you said that just made it so much worse\nAnd it is I'm Still somewhat in shock over everything that transpired in ...\nWar and um I think this is probably the most damaging thing she could have done or Indians ...\nAnd and it seems as there was a a a really awesome opportunity that could have pre presented itself to learn more about it that was lost when she doubled down and you even made mention of this before I don't know why in the world\nShe just didn't say you know I had heard stories grown up they turned out not to be true I Apologize for that\nAnd and then it ... and you know apologized and moved on instead of doubling down and tripling down and then coming out you know was the big grandiose announcement with his DNA tests and doing the video and everything that health nothing that just as you said that just made it so much worse\nAnd it is I'm Still somewhat in shock over everything that transpired in the last twenty four hours because\nIn my mind I understand what\nIndian identity is where it derives from\nIt doesn't necessarily derived\nFrom anything that I get as an individual it comes\nFrom my being a citizen of the Cherokee Nation who has treaties with the United states\nAnd that's where my right as an Indian comes from it is not individual worn doesn't seem to understand that she and she won't give it it's yeah I don't\nKnow I and then there was a huge distinction and I'm so glad that that you because I I really enjoy writing and I think that you have a a a very good way of taking anything that seems complicated and making it very easy for people to understand because that's\nReally where the focus is and and and and you laid it out so incredibly well because it I mean this is about tribal sovereignty that this isn't about race and it's not about identity politics 'cause you just explain\nWhich I I I don't know why that you know aside from uh the secretary statements or hospital junior there when when he was explaining that on on television last night that the first I think that that has ever really been put out there\nBesides what you have written in this whole conversation and I I don't think that it's yet pure pure as the the\nThe bubble so to speak um because there seem to be I mean I see some of the Warren supporters thinking well you know the DNA tests prove that but as you said that this is it it's about tribal sovereignty and ... and it's not about what what you all are pushing here which is\nWhich is true what harm does this do 'em for those who don't understand who aren't who you know are just looking at this thirty thousand a foot view would harm does this do in terms of a discussion and recognition of tribal sovereignty and awareness of it in this country\nI I [noise] from my view or seen some things happen right now that\nIt under the issue of Indian identity there is a tried and Massachusetts\nWas denied it land in trust status\nBecause it did not fit the definition of Indian\nIn Texas a federal judge recently\nStruck down the Indian child welfare act thing that it was based in the race\nAnd um it's you know it's not it's based on status I don't care what race you you're not a tribal citizen it does not apply\nSo we've seen those two things happen and it's a large Indian country say you know\nThey're trying to redefine who we are and then ...\nIt under the issue of Indian identity there is a tried and Massachusetts\nWas denied its land in trust status\nBecause it did not fit the definition of Indian\nIn Texas a federal judge recently\nStruck down the Indian child welfare act thing that it was based in the race\nAnd um it's you know it's not it's based on status I don't care what race you might do not a tribal citizen it does not apply\nSo we've seen those two things happen and it's a large Indian country say you know\nThey're trying to redefine who we are and then immediately right behind those two things Warren comes out with the\nDNA test as\nIdentity Indian identity and that is concerning\nVery concerning uh especially given I mean there's a reason why and I always say this to to people especially as it is with respect to laws I mean there's a reason why you have certain terminology there's a reason why you have certain recognitions whether it's this or whether it's this or\nOr any other issue as it pertains to law because words words matter especially when you you're talking about you know a sovereign nations and you're talking about recognition of laws and trees et cetera et cetera words matter because the the law regulate that based on what words are used\n... exactly and I I was relieved when I saw the chair Casey come out with a statement over this because at this point like you said they have not\nSaid anything against war it\nIn fact there have been times they kind of gave her a pack\nThis time they came out made a statement and it was a pretty strong statement but the key to me\nOn this whole thing is that\nOur leadership in the Cherokee Nation\nIs democratic\nThey vote democratic I mean they're highly involved\nWith the Democratic party\nSo for them to come out and make a statement like that\nIt's stronger than many people realize\nYes very significant very significant and I think that kind of highlights how bad all of the since then\nI'm a big ... and as you said it does it does a real\nDisservice and that's putting it mildly 'em and can create a lot of complications and as you said you know Senator Warren Zinn attorney\nDoesn't worry you that that someone who I'm for it you know has tried to because I think that there's a difference between saying well you you came from somewhere and then claiming that you are or something\nAnd the way that she had presented herself and and you've even written and we're talking to twyla Barnes Cherokee genealogist you've even written ... granddaughter dot com how\nAre you know ... whether it's the the rest of the people that she came out with her the story that she was telling about her mom and dad and how they had a low because of her grandparents than et cetera\nUm I mean it really I mean it it she was trying to claim that she was something which is very different than saying well I came from something\nAnd does it concern you that ... because she's a lawyer as you noted and because she's a senator and she seems to be setting herself up for a bigger race shouldn't you know more about that\nWe would hope she would um\nIt it it's troubling because\nAnd then claiming that you are or something and the way that she had presented herself and and you've even written and we're talking to twyla Barnes Cherokee genealogist you've even written ... granddaughter dot com how\nYou know ... whether it's the the rest of the people that she came out with her the story that she was telling about her mom and dad and how they had a low because of her grandparents then et cetera\nUm I mean it really I mean it it she was trying to claim that she was something which is very different than saying well I came from something\nAnd does it concern you that because she's a lawyer as you noted and because she's a senator and she seems to be studying herself up for a bigger race shouldn't she know more about that\nWe would hope she would um\nIt it it's troubling because\nShe she was in theory I don't maybe she does know more about it and she doesn't care at this point what she did yesterday\nServed jail purpose other than to try to get a jab at the president of the United states\nThere was no other purpose for that it serves no good purpose she could've ignored\nI mean we've all been insulted evolving called ... which we ignore it most of us ignore it\nRight and she just could not do that\nRight yeah and then and then we have and then she I think ... created in even worse controversy\nFor herself um twilight for I appreciate what you do and I appreciate how hard you work to educate people on on these issues and I'm an also educate people on recognition of using the proper terminology which is highly important folks you can find while at ... granddaughter\nDot com twyla Barnes a such a pleasure to have you on the show and thank you so much for your voice in for what you do\nThank you and take care and folks are and you can go up by

entrepreneurial spirit and how you were heartbroken\nWhen they sold the business and you moved into corporate America which must have been an incredible shock\nAnd awe your you know working and and dealing with the corporate structure that you never dealt with before an kitten you talk a little bit about about that you know you you touched on the pressure you touched on I'm having a you know to find that that next year when you were in sales\nAnd then what what happened as you moved out of sales\nWell what do I get I I was really in a quandary trying to figure out what I wanted to do I just wasn't sure you know where I fit in with my my God given gift and so what I did I I did several jobs on contract where I was able to go out to get for corporations and\nI'm In one day I just thought you know on doing this I'm not getting any benefit on ... well and other states I was just working forty hours but it was more as time went on but\nYou know working and and dealing with a corporate structure that you never dealt with before and can you talk a little bit about about that you know you you touched on the pressure you touched on I'm having you know to find that that next year when you were in sales\nAnd then what what happened as you moved out of sales\nWell what I did I I was really in a quandary trying to figure out what I wanted to do I just wasn't sure you know where I fit in with my my God given gift and so what I did I I did several jobs on contract where I was able to go out to different corporations\nAnd I'm In one day I just thought you know on doing this I'm not getting any benefit\nI'm working well in those days I was just working forty hours so quick [laughter] it was more as time went on but I thought you know if I'm going to be putting in forty hours a week then I probably need to to land something and so I was at a bank and they offered me a job and I ended up staying there for Seventeen years\nAnd what was happening to me like I Would maybe go in at eight o'clock in the morning and um I Would leave work about nine o'clock at night you know banks were really doing a lot of layoffs and you know if the other people's jobs Scott cut then you know they needed the people that were still there to handle the workload\nAnd I was fortunate to move up the ladder because of a person that I was reporting too and\nUm and so I ended up I was like working for a bank president and so we had our regular line of business you know the\nBusiness that we were in we were in corporate banking that paid our salaries and then we had the presidential duties and that was fine but it was a lot of hours will my boss left the bank which was stressful and I wanted to hang on because I wanted to stay there long enough to have health insurance right\nSo I scramble called all these departments around the bank that people that I've known that I got you know from being there for so long\nThen I landed a job and treasury where corporations would call in with issues and I was in corporate customer service than we would help and you know solve their their issues in their problem and\nActually when I got there and they told me that my salary was going to be kept because I made more my prior job and um and again that was long hours I was staying ask her to keep up\nAnd um you know I liked it I Love the clients but\nUm once they passed a like rule of sixty age plus number of years of being there you could early retire and so I asked her to do that at that point\nNo yeah that's you you get to that point where it's OK here I Am I've I've worked all my life for this and now I'm just telling me that's it I'm going to make any more money and um and no no way really within their structure to earn it\nAnd Leo due in in sales and you had a variety of different things that you were doing and how did how did you experience that with your career\nWell I'll tell you all and I'm just starting out you know are you from the commercial real estate brokers it my worst ones are also for a second show about the war on for years that\nI ended up you know I just got for us fed up with all what I'd do on a date and all was three years but it was that's how I got older the vote one industry and doing that I Would always do it for what would happen is you know that they give you a terror poor and you build up your oneself um and and and\nAs time went on you would end up getting the tore you'd be making pretty good money and then they'd cut and the terror reports that you just go and they call you and and that's the you know instead of getting tuned to record or sonar sales you're going to end up getting you know running\nAnd how did how did you experience stocked with your career\n[noise] well I tell you land I'm starting out you know are you from the commercial real estate brokers it my situation was I I was so tired of tech and sheriff down at the YMCA that\nI ended up you know I just got for us fed up with it all like I'd been on a date and I'll play three years and that's how I got over to the\nTo the wind industry\nAnd doing that I Would always good to well what would happen as you end up they give you a territory and you build up your wind cells um and\nAnd and as time went on you would end up getting it tore you'd be making pretty good money and then they cut your territory that you just go in and they call you and and that's like you know instead of getting two and three quarters\nFor sending out your sales you're going to end up getting you know we're going to give you tune in and of course and it's just you couldn't say I'd say you know like ... what's the matter I built this up I met all my clothes\nAnd you're going to do this to me and I just say that's the way it's going to be in because that's where it came down from ... headquarters and I'll just I'll tell you what my blood pressure would just go right through the roof\nUm and as time went on the other part of it we got older and older a lotta times you'd have to go one two o'clock in the morning go to the grocery store reset um on winds and um you're doing it for a lot of other people in the next thing you know that is doing inventories on once a month and the warehouse and\nThey just kept adding an adding things to it and um so I I just kinda when the uh had printing business has picked up and I found some pretty lucrative jobs I did that for a long time and that was that was good I\nAnd when I got out I like I mentioned in the past I never really enjoyed managing people 'cause sometimes you know it was just a manual job on the other end of the\nAd burning machine but it was just also thought that maybe they wouldn't show up or they wouldn't they be complaining or they want more money while you're in and it's just that was the first writing end of the of that business along with going on and um I had a tour\nThere's many of my members of my family die of cancer\nAs time went on I kept coming back home and I tell you that you know what my ears are ringing well and the pad printing business use these uh um oil based inks were pickup damaging to drop it off on the on the item that you're printing\nAnd Peggy said you know what just there's there's it's kind of a family business and um maybe this isn't a wise thing to do and so I'm\nWith my family being and having stomach cancer\nAnd everything I thought you know what I brought a crossing guard charge that wanted it ended up he kept bothering me wanting to buy my business and I kept telling them you know or he wanted me to teach them how to ... well I had to learn on my own and it was really it ... it's it's kind of like there's some technicalities to it and so um\nI thought you know what I'll just sell his businesses as God or get out of this thing and um you know just that I'm On top of the world right now I might as well get out at the top and so\nThat's what I ended up doing and I'm and I'm Glad I did it because I'm Still alive today\nAnd Myers aren't raining and um St Louis I Know that that was a uh but I didn't have problems that's one thing about\nBeing a pad brain but that was such a a unique business and there was so much demand for it and I'm a because a lot of people never heard of it and\nIt's really it's it's it's caught on technicalities through it and so I'm like you know or on a cell is a God or get out of this thing and I'm just I'm On top of the world right now Muslim it out at the top and so\nThat's what I ended up doing and I'm and I'm Glad I did it 'cause I'm Still alive at the end Myers are wearing\nA um thing was I you know that that was a ah I didn't have problems that's one thing about being an ad for him but it was such a a unique business and there were so much demand for it and I'm a because a lot of people never heard of it and\nAccurate today and because they talk about everything and really in a way I guess my background in the past wasn't wasted um\nBecause what happened is it all came back to me with the knowledge from the family from now from um uh just you know go into schools and learning about real estate but I had you know I Know there are certain things about the state\nOur family you know when ... and all and cousins I was kind of disenchanted because of after the passion and my parents and my aunt and uncle you know people there wasn't there needed to be a plan and\nGreat to be control on things and so I was kind of disenchanted with that it ended and the real estate um aspect and so until I came across lifestyles and they saw doll solve those problems\nOne other thing that kind of got my attention is\nI just remember my father and uncle born under a deal down in Houston and\nIt was a deal worth it was an apartment complex and I just got out of college and uh I they said you know what why don't you go to the closing down in Houston and so they gave me the closing statement and next thing you want you to\nWhen you get this call the accounting and I'm watching want you to tell them that numbers and everything so they gave me this closing statement and my wife she was\nI said I didn't tell me about this deal and stuff and I said how long have you on this and I said five years and I said I got through it analyze it and I thought I saw\nAnalyze a hundred and twenty five percent for five years and I said man I said forget that eight percent stuff I said man this is this is unbelievable and we were just limited partners in that situation that was what NASA is gone in and\nThey'd gotten in on a limited partnership and I'm I'm Down in clear like and that always stuck with me and I thought man that's just over the top\nAnd so um that kind of led me to the point where you know real estate was still on my mind and uh I'm Glad I had done what I'd done in the past and um it was painful going through the Oregon\nThe next thing you want you to when you get this call the accounting and on what you want you to tell them the numbers and everything like Amy this closing statement and my wife she was\nI said I didn't tell me about this bill and stuff and I said how long have you on this and I said five years and I said I got through with analog ... I thought I saw\nAnd you are the hundred and twenty five percent for five years in less than that I said some depth that it was such a U.S and now this is this is unbelievable and there were just limited partners in that situation that was one NASA is gone and\nGotten on a limited partnership and I'm I'm Down in ... and that always stuck with me and I thought man this is over the top\nAnd so um that kind of led me to the point where you know real estate was ... on and I'm Glad I had done what I'd done in the past and um it was painful going through the arguments for family members ethical or aunts or uncles and parents and a passing cars or you know ...\nThey're needed to be a plan and that there wasn't one and so that was a shame\nBut um I've seen everything from ... or ... and um you know just all the benefits that go with real estate so that that kind of brought me up at that point\nSo you are ready to jump in and you know you you'd you'd seen that real estate work and it's really interesting I'm I'm a second generation real estate investor too and and it's really interesting how our parents don't actually teaches the nitty gritty of the business right it's somehow it's something you do on the side while you pursue that\nTraditional route that ... yeah I think you are a lot more skeptical about this weren't you\nOh I definitely was Lynn I you know I thought about the money that we spent be trained on a stock options and we actually did tax Wayne investing for a while and that was quite an education I don't feel like that was a waste of time um\nBut you know after paying those days I thought oh no here we go again 'cause those didn't exactly work out long term chorus\nSo ... was just hot he was ready to sign up\nIt was around the holidays the Christian holidays in like every night we have our own office in our homes because we work out of our home and he just kept coming and going you're going to sign now we got to sign up there's just a real deal and I ... I just I don't know so what I did I thought I Need to put a stop to the U.S either\nRight or proven wrong because it was getting\nStressful around the house so I remember David Fisher who does the um two day training he had mentioned some\nYou know members that were national award winners and these are people competing nationwide as operators of her apartment and lifestyles had won his one I think over the last eleven years and I thought oh whatever you know so I went on lifestyles website to see if I could see their names and I did and that wasn't really a nice so what I did\nI went on to a national apartment association website\nAnd I saw their names actually winning needs towards and I thought wow I'm right around ... right and some company that can train you to do that that\nThat was the turning point for me so I decided I was ready to join and we always like hallelujah [laughter]\nActually you know that that's important\nAnd she would come around you know yeah I didn't know it but she was a member after that second day a day with\nPerjury [laughter] so um there was got whatever it took ... to get over there I was going to do it so\n[laughter] I thought I heard mama and ended up going and doing it and then she volunteers so I you know there was one more letters or you're going to do this by\nYeah [laughter] well she would love to get ...

something in during you know you you were making this this major transition\nRight and some company that we'll train you to do that that that was the turning point for me so I decided I was ready to join and layovers like hallelujah [laughter]\nActually you know that that's in\nPlay here would come around you know yeah you know she was a member after that second day a day with her so I'm able to get whatever it took ... they're always going to do it so [laughter] I thought I heard mama and end up going and doing it mentioned fall\nSo you know it was warm or whether you're going to do this by\nWell she would love to get quite a sale [laughter]\nYou know they'll really that's great it's a special ed lifestyles and he has a lot of observations in life and you know when I listen to the two

December\nIf a trade\nEveryone and we have solar panels here and I know it seems like it's a crazy time to be talking about a solar but that's not true that's not true oh I'm so glad you said that you know with these new rate plan's Carol you would think as you know as we have in past years in a PS that are electric bills are going to start going down\nWell with some of these new rape plans today pits ruled out people are gonna see still high builds because if their homes or all electric and if they're on there's two specific rate sense I'm thinking of there is this thing called demand\nAnd people are going to be shocked and seen their October or November or December December is one of the highest electric bills that comes in January right after the holidays this year if you're on budget billing and you're on one of these bad times we budget billing works is they take your total\nWhat they think you've used well they don't have a marker anymore 'cause last year's amount in different to this year's amount because the rate plan's change\nSo your budget building amount may be off [noise] some people seem to budget building going up wants to shoot some people seem to go up two or three times some people right in between but some people they won't have paid and nothing their budget building their monthly amount\nThey're going to have what's called a settled up amount at the end of the year and that comes right at the end of the year December thirty first and you have to pay that in January or your power get shut off\nSo I'm warning people\nThis is one of the best time of year\nTo do solar number two reason is you get installed in two thousand Eighteen there's a significant tax credit most people don't even know that the eligible for over ten thousand dollars usually and a thousand dollars back from the state and you'll get that right back in April of two thousand Nineteen\nAnd the third reason is\nMy money and that that's that's that's the that's a given but thanks for bringing up but next summer\nIt's gonna be hot and you're going to have an electric bill that's just going to be as bad as it was last year so get your solar put on now and start building up these these negative let me tell you something each one of these\n[noise] excuse me one of them is five hundred and eight dollars and the negative negative abs owes him five hundred and eight four hundred three hundred and these are all in the hottest months of the year Carol so now these people are going into these cooler months\nThey'll get a check back from a PS they've paid a PS nothing\nFor the months that they've had their solar working in their solar panels are paying their a PS bill now let me talk about ... families there is no buyback in as therapy but\nAs her pie in July and August is charging use thirty eight cents per kilowatt for your on peak power now\nWhen you work with me your average kilowatt is going to be between seven and a half an eight and a half

go solar and I forgot to bring that bill like the ... got a couple of bills from Mississippi one fellow and it's a very few short months saved over a thousand dollars off his electric costs ...\nWith the right amount of solar panels were not selling anything back to us or peace because that's not a thing to do there you have to know what you're doing ... and ...\nLet me talk about ... families

dollars off his electric Austin as therapy\nWith the right amount of solar panels\nWere not selling anything back to us or peace because that's not the thing to do there you have to know what you're doing ... and Carol I really appreciate you saying that I'm an advocate\nAnd this is not like when I went to nursing school you went to class this new study for a long time and yet ... and then you had to do on the floor training all the restaurant\nThere is no training for this and the last three four weeks I've had phone calls from people calling me that has had a bad solar experience asking me to help them and I'm helping each in in my own way that I can help them rectify it\nAnd my daughter almost ended up being a bad solar story had I not had the skill set and the mathematical formula to make sure her system was designed correctly that it was put together with the rate rape plan and with the right proper all the ... the nuts and bolts and pieces put together properly\nThis is what I Want you to know about solar Sandy when I say that she's Arizona's advocate and there's a lot of advocates come on my show but really\nIt's why I say that because you are out there you have done all of the research you're doing all the homework and this is not something that you just started doing you've been doing that's almost four years and maybe even more I don't really know and look for years and and and here's the thing about solar Sandy you need to understand that she's not\nYou you you are an independent you you're right in my correct that and so it's not like you know you're working from some solar company I doubt about that I work for my family's\nExactly you work for the people out there so that she can show you how you can save money on a bill that you're already paying way too much money for it she's been talking about letting your roof make money for you now for quite some time and\nShe just came in here today because now everybody that's had these solar panels on their show on their roofs and she's given them\nA Smith more which is what she's been talking about also for almost two years\nFor you guys to understand that she does it differently than anybody else out there and that's what makes for the ... the special sauce which is also something that she's been talking about which is what nobody else has out there so I was going to talk about your earlier today if you didn't make it in our time is now you did so things what I was going to say thank\nYou we could 'cause my little thing is there's lots of people around that can make hamburgers and there's only one that has a special sauce and this is my special sauce because I really have figured out formula that works and you know if it's if it's done correctly it works every single then I\nRead her out because I had the wrong paper\nTo me here's what she does she goes to everybody okay she goes valley wide and she loves to come to people she does a free no obligation free consultation she can help us almost almost anyone the number to call her direct it's six to three eight five zero eight two to nine and it's asked solar Sandy dot com\nAnd let me just tell you something else to folks or if you've heard so let's see any before and you haven't called her\nColor any weight now because she can talk to you and explain to you because this\n'cause 'cause my little thing is there's lots of people around that can make hamburgers and there's only one that has a special sauce and this is my special sauce because I really have figured out formula that works and you know if it's if it's done correctly it works every single then I read\nHer out because I had the wrong paper\nTo me here's what she does she goes to everybody okay she goes valley wide and she loves

solar Sandy dot com\nAnd let me just tell you something else to folks or if you've heard so let's see any before and you haven't called her\nCollar anyway now because she can talk to you and explain to you because this stuffed changes minute by minute if I may it's\nRidiculous ... if you don't if you're not plugged in and even if you are plugged in in your reading there is so much confusing information involved with our electric bills and our electric companies in\nThis thing and that thing that's affecting them so you have to sift through it all and you have to know what you're looking for and then\nUh when they change the rate plant you can't do solar on of family's home the way you did it two years ago 'cause it's changed as wise as it was to do it two years ago because they did it two years ago and it worked very well the way that I did it that\nWay and those people are fine they're just perfectly fine but now they've changed the rate plans and they changed the rules and they've changed this regulation if you don't know every single one of those things and every eyes and thought and he's cross it's not gonna work so those people that have called me\nI'm asking for help\nSomebody might have knocked up your door somebody might have emailed them they might have gone online looking for some information\nThere is a lot of people out there that I was looking to give you information it's not necessarily the correct way if you're looking at solar and you may be good to talk to somebody call me let me give me a second opinion if you're on the right track I'm gonna say great\nThumbs up you're good you're set if it's just like having surgery Carol\nI I just had one you can always go to get a second opinion you should anyways you know um the other one that I use

working with somebody you're you're looking at going solar because there's a lot of people out there selling it right now\nAnd I don't want to see anyone I don't want to get phone calls to three months down the road\nOh geez I should have called you solar Sandy it takes me a minute to look at something to review your we're kilowatts in your work sheet and all the rest of it and look at

can work globally\nSo that was a cool about being approached with assistant and another um a benefit for um entrepreneur in business owners for those that are home base they don't really have the

killing our little that's a fly out there that was a little bit about yourself and what you do\nAh my name's Brian wisdom and certified financial planner or I own a make a life solutions we specialize in a life insurance and group health benefits or businesses and families in Arizona\nOkay so and you're a plus ready but the better Business Bureau let's talk about you personally to with that\nSure um [noise] boy I think I've been raised with the better Business Bureau for better part of ten years it's\nBeen a how long have you been here I Am business\nOr in Arizona I've been here since two thousand one ... uh in the insurance business business uh specifically since two thousand Fifteen when I told my financial planning business\nSo let's talk about what you want to talk about today which is that you've had a huge success and I so congratulations on that let's talk about that\nThank you so about three years ago we discovered something and then as with the changes in a group health law's specific to the Affordable CARE Act in Obamacare has become sexually known\nIf you're a small business over fifty employees you're required to offer your employees health insurance and you're required to pay for it got to meet certain rules right if you're under fifty employees there's really no requirement by the federal government if you have less than fifty fulltime employees to provide a group health plan\nSo most businesses in Arizona don't write 'em what we have found uniquely is that\nIf you're over fifty employees you have to pay for that a portion of the health insurance but if you're under fifty employees the rules from the federal government tells you you don't actually have to pay\nFor health insurance you don't have to offer it and you don't have to pay for it so what if you're a small business under fifty employees and you want to offer your employees health insurance but you can't afford to pay for half of that bill\nMost of the insurance companies out there will come along and they'll tell you that as a small business employer you have to pay\nFor a good portion if not half of your employees health insurance there's a few insurance companies though that don't follow that kind of will just say I'm protocol if you will it's again it's not a requirement by the federal government that you do that so\nWhat you're able to do is you're able to offer your employees a true health insurance program without having to pay for it without having direct cost to your business and that's huge\nWell that is huge and so how do they do a free consultation with your people will sure absolutely and so when they call you they can talk to you and you can find out how you can help them offer them health insurance benefits if they'd like to without necessarily having to pay that that is correct okay how do they do that\nSo it as long as if we're talking to a small business as long as we have three people who were unrelated we can make a group health plan\nRight now it's a little easier if you have five ten or twenty obviously um but as long as you've got three unrelated people we can set up a true group health plan now why is this all important people are like well I can just go get Obamacare\nProblem with Obamacare is if you make too much\nSo what you're able to do is you're able to offer your employees a true health insurance program without having to pay for it without having direct cost to your business and that's huge\nWell that is huge and so how do they do a free consultation with your people well sure absolutely and so when they call you they can talk to you and you can find out how you can help them offer them health insurance benefits if they'd like to without necessarily having to pay that that is correct okay how do they do that\nSo it as long as if we're talking to a small business as long as we have three people who were unrelated\nWe can make a group health plan right now it's a little easier if you have five ten or twenty obviously um but as long as you've got three unrelated people we can set up a true group health plan now why is this all important people are like well I can just go get Obamacare\nProblem with Obamacare is if you make too much money\nAnd you're over that four hundred percent of the poverty level you're not going to receive a subsidy\nIf you're not receiving a subsidy those are high premiums as some people have experienced and outside of Obamacare there really is no individual group ... pardon me there is no individual health insurance available anymore it's Obamacare or or you go without [noise]\nFor the most part in a group setting now what we're able to do and what we've been finding is that the cost of health insurance runs about one third less than an an subsidized Obamacare plan\nSo if you have a family of four paying will say sixteen Seventeen hundred dollars a month for health insurance and I'm subsidized world\nWe're going to run probably run around twelve to Thirteen hundred in a group health plan so quite a bit of savings\nAdditionally you're taking a discount or pardon me you're taking the direction from your payroll taxes\nWhich saves you seven and a half percent dish a win win win across the board and you're getting\nA better network than\nYou would with a woman here well so and this is that you work with businesses only or businesses and homes and families were really only working with small business that's what I wanted to make sure okay that's what you're talking about\nCorrect we you've got to be a small business to set this up you've got to have at least a Melosi or a corporation\nAnd how many at least three people we yeah we have to have three people that are that are non related not related okay and so that can be a lot of people actually\nYeah it can so like for instance I smell real estate team you know you've got a I I think you just had a guest on that has he in a Mr his sister so that might not work so well um if you bring on a third person though where\nLet's say they've got somebody who's in the office just answering phone calls now we're starting to get into the realm\nI have a perfect example at my ex husband he has a business in the business has even though they work out of the house they have a about three or four people that are working in there and it is at El Al the perfect is a perfect example\nThat is a prime example of a business that if they're if they're successful business so everybody in there is making you know a decent amount of money or at least the top\nSay twenty percent of those employees typically are making over that Obamacare threshold this really make some sense and Carol point out something kind of interesting and this is a question I get a lot and people are a little bit misinformed\nThey think that if they if a business\nOffers health insurance that the employees are then precluded from going under Obamacare and receiving a subsidy\nIn the under fifty employee world that is not true because if the employer and this is key here if the employer is not paying any portion of the employees\nIs uh El Al the perfect but as a perfect example\nIs a prime example of a business that if they're if they're successful business so everybody in there is making you know a decent amount of money or at least the top twenty percent of those employees typically are making over that Obamacare threshold this really make some sense\nOf Carol point out something kind of interesting and this was the question I get a lot and people are a little bit misinformed\nThey think that if they if a business\nOffers health insurance that the employees are then precluded from going under Obamacare and receiving subsidies\nIn the under fifty employee world that is not true because if the employer and this is key here if the employer is not paying any portion of the employees premiums were not meeting the definition of affordable\nAs long as we don't meet the definition of affordable the employee can still go on to the health care dot Gov Web site and get subsidized Obamacare plan\nWow so they let me give out your information that phone number to call him it's foray into four four\nTo five five nine to its el ... and it's spelled H ... N E G A life\nSolutions dot com and you know I think the best thing to do is listening to this I Love this about my show is just the information out there for everybody to here and do what you want with it you know what this is the kind of stuff that's cool that you might want to call them up and check it out and see if it works for you\nYeah for a lot of businesses this is a game changer because what they're able to do is offer their employees a true group health plan it's going to help them with re trench in recruitment and if it comes it known necessarily no direct costs to the employer\nAnd that's that's the big the big\nThat's huge and it's also you'll yeah Mike I think the main thing is so many people especially if you are offering healthcare\nYour employees they're going to stay\nThere to be good to you and they're going to stay because they stay because they want those benefits and that's a huge ah that's something huge again you can check him out on his website it's L. make a life solution\nThat's with an S. dot com and you could call them direct that phone number is four into four four to five five nine to can you help anyone in the valley [noise]\nAh well help any business in the valley\nAny business and again we want to make sure that you understand that it's a business that has at least three or more yeah and and also that they are non related it can be something like like my actually has the works out of the house with several people\nGo ahead okay so let me ask you said there are there any minimum to the number that we talked about the employees um or any other rules that they should know about\n... the biggest thing I Would tell you is will will handle the ... ... ... if if and when you decided to give me a call will make sure that you're eligible\nWill go through the the basic checklist insurance companies going to care about and kind of thought her I's and cross our TV's the biggest takeaway as if you have employees between let's say you've got between three people and fifty people in your company and you want to offer health insurance plan but you can't afford to do so\nThis is a viable solution we're not talking about some\nKind of piece together thing this is a true group health plan no different than what you would get it any major in poor\nTaste something we've been talking a little bit about um best kept secrets today and this is another one of them and it's something that people may not know about and I you know I've been calling you I Know we just talked about this beforehand and now I Know why you've been so busy\nBecause basically you're getting the word out about this and you're trying to show people how they could do something that's going to help them and it's a win win ... solution for everyone\nCorrect I'm so in a small business\nAnd a daughter I's and cross our TV's the biggest takeaway as if you have employees between let's say you've got between three people and fifty people in your company and you want to offer health insurance plan but you can't afford to do so this is a viable solution we're not talking about some\nKind of piece together thing this is a true group health plan no different than what you would get it any major importer\nBut hey it's something we've been talking a little bit about um best kept secrets today and this is another one of them and it's something that people may not know about and I you know I've been calling you I Know we've been just talked about this beforehand and now I Know why you've been so busy\nBecause basically you're getting the word out about this and you're trying to show people how they can do something that's going to help them and it's a win win the solution for everyone\nCorrect I'm so in a small business world we really don't take on businesses with more than fifty employees are what we find most health insurance brokers want those bigger businesses there's a lot of competition out there for that and most health insurance brokers I think\nAre are making a poor decision and not paying attention to the smaller business because those are the ones that really really need the help\nRight I think what what you've done it's you've really made a niche for yourself you know we have absolutely again telling again what it is so they can understand it\nOkay now the phone number to call her for eight oh three five three nine eight or nine and I see that there you are offering at special offer for your first coaching session which in this is in a to have to be scheduled in October and that you're going to do this\nThis is a yellow you have to do is mentioned that you did a couple of show that you heard the couples route and that's all you have to do is say that and you're going to get a hundred dollars off your first coaching session but it has to be scheduled in October is that correct yes okay\nYeah it can actually be yet so if you call in October\nAnd we happened to schedule November that's fine that's okay but it all has to be made in October\nYou need to make that call now what's the point\nIt's called a call to action caught an action so yeah and I'm the first session would have a hundred dollars off um but actually there's two ways that couples can approach this\nIn one way is to um I work with couples on a month to month basis so just like regular um singles coaching we meet twice a month and work\nWork through the issues and um the goals and everything we need to work on\nBut also there is a one day intensive ... program so this\nYeah you heard the couples route and that's all you have to do is say that and you're going to get a hundred dollars off your first coaching session but it has to be scheduled in October is that correct yes okay yeah it can actually be yet so if you call in October\nAnd we happened to schedule November that's fine that's okay but it all has to be made in October you need to make that call now what's the point it's called a call to action caught an action so yes\nAnd I'm the first session would have a hundred dollars off um but actually there's two ways that couples can approach this in one way is to um I work with couples on a month to month basis so just like regular um singles coaching we meet twice a month and work\nWork through the issues and um the goals and everything we need to work on\nBut also there is a one day intensive ... program so this I can only offer like two of the month um because we set aside of a day and\nIt's we go I I come to you and we make things happen and we develop that language around money and a develops um\nA protocols for discussing money and where you're at\nAnd how you want to move forward well I Know there's a lot of people that listen to this that I'm sure you have a significant other and you know the one thing that you fight over most is the money\nAnd I want to talk a little bit more about what it is that we you know what how you got even into this how did you do this I mean and what made you thought about it because I see it right here at the time [noise]\nUm well so I actually have been um I was blessed I was I'm married to my high school sweetheart for over Thirty years\nAnd uh did we argue about money while maybe a little bit [laughter] I'll just go right there but then in two thousand fourteen I found myself single and I needed to figure out money and so when I did is I went on to a personal quest to become an expert\nAnd as I became that expert and over the course of time I realized I loved\nPersonal finances\nAnd when I looked around I when I asked my friends to help me figure things out they weren't able to so they did not know no one that I could find a answer my questions was able to help me and so that's why I ended up becoming a financial coach and and becoming an expert\n'em and you can help people valley wide I help people valley wide I have clients in other states we do video conferencing and that's a lot of fun so it doesn't really matter where you live it just matters that you get started\nIt it doesn't really matter that you get started and it's important to do this this month especially because she's got an offer that she's offering for everybody color direct her phone number is four into three five three nine eight or nine and her website is tea\nAnd it's spelled out Andy and H financial coaching dot com\nIs that right that's correct I'm doing off the top of my head 'cause it's not right in here so okay and so when people work with you All right let's talk a little bit about this when you're working with them what do you find that the the ... when you\nWhen you start working with them what is the first thing that you that they need to do when they come to you because I Am sure that the first thing that they tell you that can never get the the the checkbook right what is it that you find that the first thing that they always say it's a number one thing\nThat the with the clients with your clients with the couples when it when that my wife can never get the check book right we're always never have any ... of enough money what is it I'm like all of the above\nActually is the number one thing is that they don't have the same understanding of what's supposed to be happy\nFinancial coaching dot com is that right that's ... I'm doing off the top of my head 'cause it's already here so okay and so when people work with you All right let's talk a little bit about this when you're working with them what do you find that the the ... when you\nWhen you start working with them what is the first thing that you that they need to do and they come to you because I Am sure that the first thing that that tell you that can never get the the the the checkbook right what is it that you find that the first thing that they always say it's a number one thing\nThat that with the clients with your clients with the couples when it when that my wife can never get the check book right we're always never have any ... of enough money what is it I'm like all of the above\nActually is the number one thing is that they\nDon't have the same\nUnderstanding of what's supposed to be happening with the money and so uh the person that's used they usually there's one um partner that's in charge of the money\nAnd they assume that the other person knows what to do and the other person actually doesn't and so because they haven't been talking about it and communicating in a way that both people can understand\nThey can't move forward and so then they argue because they're ... it's like talking a foreign language to each other you know if you start talking to foreign language with me I Would be like okay I have no idea what you're going to do so I'm just gonna\nKinda keep doing the same thing I've been doing and hopefully it all turns out okay what about\nPeople that have kids so people that have kids um [noise]\nWhat I find is that most couples with kids aren't a acting as a unit when it comes to the kid\nHere's what I Want to do this the first thing that I Want to do is I Want to make sure that everybody understands something that she'll help anyone with it doesn't matter today she's talking about\nCouples but it doesn't matter anybody who is interested in in in getting control and empowering yourself with your finances she can help anyone from anywhere because she can Skype and she can help you like that she does do free consultation\nToday she's talking about couples and I love the topic and you know what you guys out there there's a lot of us out there that are married that probably the number one reason you bought it ... even a you know fight is because of your financial situation and if you have kids you absolutely no it's even worse so you can call her direct her phone number is four into\nThree by three nine eight or nine that teen age financial coaching dot com [noise]\nAre you looking to create a new financial beginning\nHave you recently been through a divorce bankruptcy or even a death in your family at teenage financial coaching we know how to get you started we offer one to one coaching that will help you on the path\nTo your new financial success call or text T.
