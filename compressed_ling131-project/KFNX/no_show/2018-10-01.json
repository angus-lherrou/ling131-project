he's the father of Christine them around the third\nChristine in around the surge grandfather was Nicholas sneak former CIA director William Casey is acknowledged ... decades of tournaments for the CIA at the highest levels\nI I mean David died I didn't know\nUntil later that she headed up the recruitment program and I wonder if she's got young Google interns living at her house yeah I mean this is unbelievable\nBoy you know Alex any surprise that the CIA move they refer to themselves as red coats in this context or\nIs it a surprise that the CIA that has spent decades on arranging coups and overthrowing governments abroad are doing it now at home I mean we were warned by the spy our founders by Madison instead of tyranny comes\nTo America will come in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy that have been given a black budget that had been given carte block that had been given our liberties so they can fight foreign enemies abroad and yet now what we see is that the CIA is nothing other than a self interested in group\nTrying to fight Americans here domestically to overthrow our\nOwn lady who was only after our our ... our deep state CIA and then she's working with them and then no one's even making an issue out of this this is unbelievable but of course this did see stupid person could only operate in Lebanon the confines of the deep state swamp word daddy feeds her I mean that's a good thing\nYeah yeah and and uh again no basis for proof but they don't need any basis because these are the types of tactics that we should all the time that quite frankly no Alex when I look at Lindsey Graham I agree with him I mean this is shameful what has happened I Wish that the Republicans had not countenance that\nOrban accomplices in it with Roy Moore because that

military but given the ... military his praising David I mean we have to deal with\nThese are the types of tactics that we should all the time it quite frankly no Alex when I look at Lindsey Graham I agree with him I mean this is shameful what has happened I Wish that the Republicans had not countenance to\nOrban accomplices in it with Roy Moore because that established this precedent you go along with that and you get more of it they saw that at work they can make like a pad and he said she said situation with a bunch of unsubstantiated crazy or over the\nSame thing when you got the ram and all these others\nThat are establishment starting to flip out this isn't fake people know the deep state wants to destroy America it has a hard on for it and it's gone too far and people want it out we want it gone there in a way of progress are allied with China Google arrogant lean not giving a technology we paid for\nIt to the U.S military but giving it in the ... military his treason David I mean we have to deal with these people now\nThat's right and yet as we say you know we heard Ted Cruz or a bushy Graham May be talking about on the hearing yesterday talking about the excellent report that the American bar association had given Kavanaugh initially\nAnd now they are coming back even though you know we had we played this multiple times and played it again today Joe Biden saying uh twenty seven years ago\nThat the FBI doesn't have anything to do with this I mean they've already had now eight nine hours of testimony from then what's the FBI going to give us are just going to give us that testimony again\nThen a condensed form they're not going to draw any conclusions and yet the American bar association is urging a delay on this now and so this is the difficulty with is going to have this road today to get it out of committee tomorrow they're going to have a procedural vote but they're not going to really vote on the Senate until next week and a lot of things can happen\nAnd that was what what do you think they're going to pull out I mean I think they see their Waterloo if they don't win that Senate they're going to lose their all hands on deck no holds barred yeah totally committed a thirty nine days out I think we're going to pull something back\nWell yeah and again the only thing that we've got really going in our favor of course there's not going to work a Jeff Flake or it's like it's going to have to vote Republicans he said he's going to do it but then you know they're saying well he's over you're talking to this guy ... we'll see what happens I don't trust them into actually the boat or if he votes they get it out of the committee\nAnd then you've got a situation where these people want to draw this to a conclusion one way or the other because early next week\nOr they have to go home and they've got to get started campaigning because they're getting very close to the election and you've got a lot of these people like Mitch and we're going to be going into areas that are heavily went for President Trump and Trump is going to say they shut down my pick\nAnd a lot of these places are conservative enough they don't like these kind of shenanigans about he said she said without any due process without any evidence crashing a man's life like that so that's going to be very difficult for them to immediately leave this and go home and try to win an election so that's some pressure on them from that side\nOtherwise would be really a dire straits here [noise]\nWell I Know that his art riveting hounded me alive in an incredible found to be on air and I'm just praying for judge Kavanaugh I'm praying for you and praying for all grown I'm praying for the audience because out of the time to get in on our needs to God\nThat was wrong

for that\nDon't let your dog itch scratch stink or shed like crazy come to China for help\nEight five nine four to eight one thousand eight five nine four to eight went down into the I ...\n[noise]\nThey Joe\nWalsh it's a no show friday I Want to talk to you off the ledge man I I this is a I I this is good news and we got a lot of people on conservative talk radio and Fox News complain the new\n... new show to screw the last two weeks or three weeks or three months movement stop\nAnd I want you to look at it like this\nAnd I've changed my mind on this I changed my mind on this now I wouldn't have changed my mind on this a week ago or two weeks ago or three weeks ago but after yesterday\nAfter yesterday\nI Want to take away\nThe one card the Democrats have left\nB I investigation it's all they asked for yesterday she'll call their bluff\nAgain let me be let me be really tough here\nAnd let me cut right to the core\nSo Donald Trump today under pressure or ordered an FBI investigation\nTo look at current incredible charges it's not supposed to last more than a week\nHere's the deal this is why I think this is a really good thing\nI Want Kevin ... on the Supreme Court\nBut more importantly I Want his name cleared I Won his reputation restored if he gets on the Supreme Court without this he he might be early when but he will be for average tarnished\nI I Want him to be independent and strong and they have a great reputation to get on the Supreme Court\nOkay she'll give the Democrats what they want to give them one more week give them this magical FBI investigation that they've been clamoring for for days\nGive it to him\nThe FBI comes back with nothing\nI Want Kevin ... on the Supreme Court\nBut more importantly I Want his name cleared I Won his reputation restored if he gets on the Supreme Court without this he he might be early when when he will be for advertising ...\nI I Want him to be independent and strong and they have a great reputation to get on the Supreme Court\nOkay she'll give the Democrats what they want to give them one more week give them this magical FBI investigation that they've been clamoring for for days give it to him\nIf the FBI comes back with nothing\nThat's it\nDemocrats don't have another card to play that's it\nAnd and and then when you vote on Kavanaugh\nMan he's in a much stronger position he'll get more votes and you know what because the Democrats have placed so much stock on this thing called an FBI investigation they've made it out to be the be all end all end if the FBI investigation then pretty much clears Kavanaugh\nThen then then men his reputation is back his name\nHas been cleared\nIf the FBI conducts an investigation in three or four or five days and finds out that Brett Kavanaugh has been lying\nUh I don't want to get Kevin on the Supreme Court if he's been lying about this you\nKnow the FBI is either going to find something really damning about Brett Kavanaugh\nIn which case he's been lying about all this\nOr they're basically not going to be able to find anything more that the Senate and everybody else is found which means that's it\nI I think this is the best thing in the world\nThat could happen to Brett Kavanaugh\nAs much as\nA show we gotta wait another week yeah you know what we do you do because it's that important right now this man has been thrown out on the street his reputation is in tatters\nIf he's innocent and I know most of all of us think he's in the sense well then doggone it get his reputation back let me go to mark Kay mark you're on with Joe\nAnd Joe's with\nUs about the style of I've ever had anything to her and but right now for going to bring their own\nOr let me follow able to call her credit the Republicans ... ... pound them on their Pakistan area or they have felt very up there's a\nLot of other states have their say bye or any other woman white but all the way that's that's a false lawyer\nAnd mark thank you thank you know look guys like Schumer in Durban\nThey're not most of the Democrats are voting for Calvin or no\nTo get his reputation back let me go to mark hey mark you're on with Joe\nDarger anything here oh I've been going on here and if you add to it\nOr something there's a fear that they're all going to her and but for a quick point there no\nI wasn't able to call her credit the Republicans ... ... pound them on their hypocrisy Perrier or they have felt very up there to play a\nLot of other states have their say they have another woman white but all the way that's the fault of oil\nAnd mark thank you thank you know look guys like Schumer in Durban\nThey're not most of the Democrats are voting for Calvin not no matter what and it's got nothing to do with Dr Blasey Ford's\nBut you've got about eight or so red state Democrats who are on the fence\nWho really are on the fence for political reasons\nYou give the Democrats this final thing they want give me the FBI investigation\nThe final stamp of approval if you give them it and the FBI gives their stamp of approval to Bob Brett Kavanaugh\nWill then eat these eight red state Democrats like mansion in West Virginia and Donnelly in Indiana\nThey're probably going to end up voting for Brett Kavanaugh\nHe'll probably after this FBI investigation assuming right that it it gives the exonerate Sam he'll probably get sixty or more votes in the Senate\nHis reputation will have been back\nHis name will be cleared\nAnd he'll be in a much stronger position\nAs a smart thing to do politically\nAt this point after yesterday\nAnd it's the right thing to do\nAnd by the way and if you're on the line stay on the line I'm coming to all the and this is what we're talking about again the day\nYou believe Brett Kavanaugh's innocent\nWhat's just three to four day FBI investigation [noise] gonna gonna threatened you with that\nI'm Joe Walsh don't go anywhere [noise]\n[noise]\nIt's time to check the freedom voicemail when you're saying about you know\nIt's time to check the wall street and voicemail when you're saying about Joe ... down and I know\nWell that's a good thing too\nBecause if he has been lying about this the whole time I don't want 'em on the Supreme Court\nBut the odds are that's not what the FBI is going to find\nI think this is pretty simple and and I think a lot of the conservative TV and radio folk out there who've been crying and moaning about this all day today they're missing the boat\nThere miss this is too important\nIf you really want this man on the Supreme Court\nLet's do it the right way [noise]\nFlips do with the right way I'm Joe Walsh don't go anywhere [noise]\nIs your daily half of civil disobedience sister Joe Walsh program on the Senate if [noise]\nIf you're a small

senators are doing in the whole process by the way on the FBI investigation\nIt's not a criminal investigation\nThere is no grand jury\nOr the FBI can't subpoena records or force anyone to testify they are going to interview the main actors here and as many witnesses\nAs they can and remember this what if the FBI conducts the three to four day investigation and they find out that Dr Blasey Ford perjured herself who knows a time you're on man\nHey Joel is good talking with you you too I get it I understand yeah you can disarm a Democrat\nBut there's always something else that's going to fall on the sleeve and I'm just curious what is going to be the next go late tactic and like Charlie Brown around with kick the ball and he told the fall away that's what they do\nIt Tom you're right you're right to be concerned what's going to be the next card that the Democrats have to play there isn't going to be one I guess that's the point I'm making this is it this is yet\nThey were screaming for two things\nThey were screaming for Dr Ford to be heard she was hurt and they've been screaming from day one to reopen the FBI investigation that said\nThis is there this is what they'd been asking for so there's nothing else you know what I think the spineless Republicans in the Senate and the house\nI can guarantee you that this is it after this FBI investigation the Democrats will not have one more delay tactic to play and again assuming Brett Kavanaugh is innocent or this will put him in such a stronger\nPosition let me go to a manual hey manual\nHi Joe I'm agreeing with you it would be a good thing if it was just restricted to the you know misfortune allegations but my understanding is that there are um\nScope is too it's the Ford allegations plus any other credible

bitcoin having cash seller took it talked to another guy who just sold his house\nFor bitcoin yeah so this house for bitcoin and it's\nYou gotta put pen to paper and make a decision on what you want to do I'm going to get to this story or there's one about mount ... and the one about what the FCC just did a about a week ago but the story is just now coming out I've been holding on to it because I didn't really want to talk about it but it's a good time this week because bitcoin is one of the most secure\nA ways of doing business it's it's a very low risk very low risk in my opinion very low risk conservative type a purchase\nYou can go out and buy yourself a boat\nAnd uh the value goes down you know eighty percent minute you drive you know Hollywood off the lot\nCars fifty percent houses go up houses go down you know that's a good value right there bitcoin for those you don't know it was regulated under Irish code for real estate so it's a good conservative it's becoming a house the value or a store a value\nAnd that's how starting to roll out and they we don't nobody really gonna know nobody's gonna know till they're really rolls out\nHow bitcoin is is going to secure its future as a\nAs money as a monetary way of a way that you can trends act\nAnd an alternative to using cash nothing wrong with using cash but anybody who's invested anybody who knows anybody pays attention knows\nThat the governments of the world wants to go to a casual society they're confiscating is much cash is they can as often as they can the banks don't want you to have cash that's why they do what\nThey give you credit have you ever got an increase or just a credit card say by the way and you go I Can't believe I got a credit card 'cause they don't want you to have cash\nThey'd rather bet on you to have credit\nThen for you to have the cash in your hand now there's a couple of stories going out I'm gonna get to hear and second about what the FCC did and what Mt ... did was unloading some of the coin but to roll up to what I was saying earlier ... so\nYou have to make sure that you have your T's crossed your I's dotted all the time in business we have attorneys et cetera you know just like any standard normal business does but and there's raises behind it because we don't want people stealing one of the things I talk about all the time or the exchanges that aren't\nThey're not putting the money that they should be in cyber security to keep your coin and\nKeep your what you've purchased\nSafe\nThey're back on you to have credit\nThen for you to have the cash in your hand now there's a couple of stories going out I'm gonna get to hear and second about what the SEC did and what Mt ... did was unloading some of the coin but to roll up to what I was saying earlier ... so\nYou

and knowing how to buy in the depths\nAnd then knowing how to take advantage of the when the price goes up and the trading other coins anyway it's pretty neat to watch what goes on but you have to be careful week cold storage let me get back to my point here now because we called stores that means we take it off line\nAnd we have they go what do you feel we're not going to lose it [laughter]\nOr we're not going to lose it\nYou said a plan to reach each one of those implants change all the time because that's a good idea [laughter]\nI didn't make it up [laughter]\nOh boy twenty something years old not almost worth a million dollars all in the last you know three or four years of just trading and taking small risks and being smart about it and knowing how to buy in the depths\nAnd then knowing how to take advantage of the when the price goes up and the trading other coins anyway it's pretty neat to watch what goes on but you have to be careful we cold storage let me get back to my point here now because we called stores that means we take it off line\nAnd we have they go what do you feel that we're not going to lose it [laughter]\nOr we're not going to lose it\nWe have several places that are secure that we keep yeah so here's a simple way you're downloaded laminated you put it in your guns say maybe a ... in the basement up and the addict give some family member you trust maybe get yourself a safety deposit box and put it in the bank how's that for some security\nMaybe give it to your broker the brokerage firms\nTo keeping their filed for say keeping got trust your broker for that the U.S securities and Exchange Commission is it filed charges against international securities dealer one bull LCD which was offering bitcoin funded security base swaps according to an FCC announcement\nJust published part of the athletes say the case involves Marshall Islands based corporation one poll LCD\nWhich provides cryptic currency related services and stand behind one broker dot com and its Austria based CEO Patrick Burner\nNow the complaint alleges that the parties violated federal security laws in connection with security base swap bonds with bitcoin so let me just lay it out here for you okay or just a little bit more on on the on the a store here but\nThe SEC alleging further alleges that burner and broke one failed a trans fat\nIts security based swaps on a traditional and I listen to this traditional exchange register and the U.S as well as properly register as a security base swaps dealer anyway that's one of the things you had to pay attention by everywhere be careful they're going to pay a fine\nThey can afford it they're gonna pay a fine they're going to get a slap on the wrist\nAnd and I'm confident or not I don't know this company ...\nUh they issued to see a cease and desist order and the two hundred thousand dollar fine crypto Asset Management and its founder Timothy ... the FCC order says that the um\nThe the misrepresented themselves as a first regulated crypto asset funding the United states and re re three point six million this is another story that goes along with it\nOr at first regulated crypto asset fund in the United states right three point six million from forty for investors and late twenties Seventeen bringing it snaps at set its net asset to thirty seven million\nThere's another story I'm not going to really talk about it but I can tell you the the synopsis and here's what happened so there was a ... they ... they did and I feel they raise some money\nA couple of hundred thousand dollars and the FCC said something to them they go and they gave it all back and say here's your money back they did a really really good um and I'm not going to get into the coin because it'd be unfair to picture of them that way I'm not going to slander them that's what happens is the difference between fake news\nLate twenties Seventeen bringing it snaps at set its net at that to thirty seven million there's another story I'm not going to really talk about it but I can tell you the the synopsis and here's what happened so there was a ... they right they did an idea they raise the money\nA couple of hundred thousand dollars and the FCC said something to and they go and they gave it all back and say here's your money back they did a really really good um and I'm not going to get into the coin because it'd be unfair to picture of them that way I'm not going to slander them that's\nAnd then they sell the coins to everybody else yeah that's what they've been buying and selling day trading it for well over a a good year going on two years and large amounts to by the way so anyway that's why I got to pay attention you can never play against the big boys and the big girls you just can't\nCan't compete okay that's why it's important to be careful where you by buying an somebody I'm getting off the subject here but I'm going to get back to the story here are the how many people are on bank and why it's important okay why that matters to you because\nAmount ... just downloaded a bunch of coins uh through their sell off right at their ... their bankruptcy\nAnd everyone said they're going to ... ... they're going to unload or two or three hundred million so far they've unloaded about eight hundred million and give her take on to the exchanges it didn't do anything that six thousand mark sixty three hundred and sixty five hundred is held really solid\nIf you look back over this last year that looks like that's the bottom point but it's a good bottom point came and it looks like it that may be the starting point for the next Bull Run but we'll say OK\nBut you're looking at a most of the world is on banked and never going to become banked\nAccording to President Trump's stat of stats and I'm going by President Trump figures here that twenty percent\nOf the workforce here in the United states ... twenty percent whether they're the two percent investor the Ninety eight percent done but\nOut of all the people that are working steady full time jobs here in the United states twenty percent of those are what's called on bank and what that means is they're using they have bank accounts but what they're doing is they don't put one dollar into the ... only the minimum amount to keep 'em open\nBut they're doing other things with your wallet so the more transactions that are made on line\nThe more store of value or value\nOr becomes more valuable than a dollar in hand that's why the government doesn't want you are the banks don't want you to have cash on hand they want to confiscate it as much as they can because that's the story of value it's valuable it value to have money in hand\nTwo percent investor the Ninety eight percent done but\nOut of all the people that are working have steady fulltime jobs here in the United states twenty percent of those are what's called on bank and what that means is they're using they have bank accounts but what they're doing is they don't put one dollar into the counts only the minimum amount to keep 'em open\nBut they're doing other things with your wallet so the more transactions that are made on line\nThe more store of value or a value\nOr becomes a more valuable than a dollar in hand that's why the government doesn't want you are the banks don't want you to have cash on hand they want to confiscate it as much as they can because that's the story of value it's valuable it value to have money in hand\nIt's also a store a value to have on line so the more online purchases more value it is why is that well because those coins become a store of value\nSo as you're able to set spend it and buy it back it becomes more valuable\nSpend it and receive it as you're able to buy it and hold it it becomes more value a store a value something that you're going to want to hold onto now with bitcoin and twenty twenty it's going to do what's called having\nWhat that means for those who are images made just going to be more difficult to mind and when it becomes more difficult to mind what that means is going to be more valuable for you to hold onto\nSo they're predictor is\nIn twenty twenty twenty Twenty one\nThe value of coin if it doesn't go up by then is going to be tremendous that's why it's important that you put pen to paper do not miss the bitcoin revolution don't do it\nYou're going to have a chance that the stock market people had a hundred and twenty four years ago when they started the New York stock exchange if you would have bought in in a hundred dollars then you'd be worth hundreds of millions of dollars hundreds of millions today\nIt's the same thing it's the future of money it's just the evolution of money online banking those have you got money in your in your wallet that spend it forever anything you could imagine\nPay pal what else apple pay what else do you go to Starbucks banned the grocery stores are starting to have him any there's all kinds of applications online\nSo if you can't put the two together you need to just slow down for a second put pen to paper it'll make sense you can also go to be I keep saying that B. I. T. C. Twenty one dot com that's be I teach say Twenty one dot com I lay it out there\nYou can see if you would have bought an eight years ago what you'd be work today it's enough to make you want to sit down and go all boy\nOkay that's the first group of billionaires hundred millionaires and billionaires it's okay All right you're never going to get that again but it's okay because other coins coming

that is a great value why because ... was it Nineteen thousand six hundred and Seventy dollars less than a year ago\nLet me say that again bitcoin was it Nineteen thousand six hundred and Seventy

have guard duty over the bridge\nA and that bridge was I don't know about a thousand two thousand feet away from North Korea [noise] and uh we all can tell you stories about we've been through there\nAnd is very very interesting uh we went through at that particular time we were there and we're talking about Nineteen sixty eight sixty nine when we were there and uh you know and I know will

the Carolinas unit did you move by the way\nYeah I moved about a twenty miles a closer to family and uh I've been doing that about the last two weeks but up pretty situated right now\nThat's good well you know we talked a little bit over the weekend about that letter a was just showing my coach hear jokes alimony here the letter and he just rented and why don't you tell us a little bit about the letter to presumptive list what happened with it back in two thousand ten\nWell starting in uh uh we're talking about Agent Orange in Korea of course right up back in two thousand and eight or I was the first\nTime that I never even heard about a Agent Orange in Korea and had been forty years since we were stationed there\nAnd uh it was basically a big secret nobody knew about it they knew about Vietnam and all the ... you know Agent Orange spray the Vietnam and nobody knew anything about Korea and it ... it was really a\nWeird situation I went to the Veterans Administration office in Winston Salem North Carolina and I was talking to our veterans service officer\nAnd uh I I told him that you know I had heard that uh I was eligible for the V. A. and uh you know blah blah blah and he said what what year were you stationed there and I said well I was stationed in Nineteen sixty seven sixty eight\nAnd he said well I'm going to tell you something but don't get me in trouble\n[laughter] and I've always remembered what exactly what he said there's no doubt in my mind what he said\nAnd he went and pulled his book out of the show up and he handed me a piece of paper and it was a department of defense a memorandum that uh Agent Orange had been used in Korea the same as it was in uh Vietnam but they were not going to acknowledge it\nUnless you were on this list that he termed the presumptive units list\nSo the presumptive units list had\nCertain people that were on the DMZ and station near to the DMZ and worked on the DMZ and the other people in Korea were not included\nIn this directed so\nBasically what it translated to was if you were within these units specific units or the VA would talk to you about your Agent Orange and you would be owned a presumptive a unit list and if you were and you had to prove exposure which is very difficult\nShe had been used in Korea the same as it was in Vietnam but they were not going to acknowledge it unless you were on this list that he termed the presumptive units list so the presumptive units Liz had\nCertain people that were on the DMZ and station near to the DMZ and worked on the DMZ and the other people in Korea were not included in this direct so\nBasically what it translated to was if you were within these units specific units or the VA would talk to you about your Agent Orange and you would be owned a presumptive a unit list and if you were and\nYou had to prove exposure which is very difficult to forty years later because nobody knew anything about it being used in\nYou know and it's it's interesting but I was in for you will most of us\nThat we're all in that one unit here at that period of time I'd out any of us would have known about it if it wasn't for you trying to get a hold of everybody and I don't know how the heck you did it but you did it and I mean finally got a hold of me three years later\nI finally found me uh but if it wasn't for you none of us would have really even known about it or filed any claims about it\nSo this is like the first time that it was ever used because by Vietnam it was more commonly understood that it was around but in Korea people just hadn't heard of it yet so this was like a a first run of the Agent Orange\nThat's true you know there's there's an area that will will will and I know we were we used to pull guard duty on this bridge you know and below the bridge was a river [noise] and uh I guess a\nReason for having a bridge yeah after a while I was to enrich was railroad\nBridge and that was destroyed yeah and uh we used to take your one bridge a one way traffic going both ways and but you know it was like a thousand feet below and all they shrubbery there and\nEverybody from the you know these people from North Korea trying to cross that river at night yeah so they decided to spray all that stuff to get rid of it so we could actually see him\nAnd er I don't remember who have maybe you do okay you know every time we were on that bridge when it was daylight we could see and if there was a chopper overhead going somewhere whoever would look up we know who they were and if they didn't look up to find out which direction that shoppers were going and we knew that\nThey were okay you're recollect that stuff [noise] well I\nI ... I I remember like it was yesterday but the you know the it was freedom bridge\nAnd the river was the M joined river right\nAngle that is a uh not much\nMore than a mile from the DMZ and ... one of the

Rachel Mitchell noted that she did not name Kavanaugh until now [noise]\nUm apparently Emma brown at the Washington Post because remember Dr for days the Washington Post her therapists note\nBut she would not give the committee that's determining if she is she's looking to report information about Brett Kavanaugh the committee that's making a determination as to whether or not Cavanaugh I was going to be on the Supreme Court she's refused to give that committee her therapist note I Wonder why well immigrant over at the Washington Post noted that\nFord did not name Kavanaugh in any of the note\nThat's why\nSo she provided the Washington Post with her therapist note that the committee making a decision on the actual nomination of the Supreme Court justice she refused to give than her note but one thing to consider the fact that her no she says corroborate her testimony\nBut she can't see the notes\nBut just trust or that the notes corroborate everything that she's telling them but you can't see the note literally that is what the lay of the land it but the Washington Post as she didn't mention Kavanaugh\nShe was not the only time cabinet ever came up was after the news broke that he was the nominee he would not ever mentioned in her notes\nThat Michel ... outlined there was NO NAME and the twenty twelve marriage therapy notes NO NAME given and the twenty Thirteen individual therapy note\nIt took thirty six years for him to for his name to emerge and\nSo that's I mean I I just I don't know um [noise]\nMitchell notes quote Dr Ford testify that she told her husband about quote sexual assault before they were married\nBut she told the Washington Post that gene former husband that she was a victim of physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage she testified that both time she was referring to the same incident so for um Mitchell says at Ford was changing her description of the incident to become less specific [noise]\nAh Mitchell\nSays she noted that there was no memory of who invited her to the party how she heard about it really where it was how she got to it\nAnd um\nShe did not know how she got home she did not know if she made a phone call she did not know she talked to anyone else at there after ...\nUm Mitchell also noted quote according to her\nAnd\nSo that's I mean I I just I don't know um [noise]\nMitchell notes quote Dr Ford testify that she told her husband a buddy of quote sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post that gene former husband that she was a victim of physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage she testified that both time she was referring to the same incident\nSo forward um Mitchell says at Ford was changing her description of the incident to become less specific [noise]\n\nAh Mitchell says she noted that there was no memory of who invited her to the party how she heard about it really where it was how she got to it\nAnd um she did not know how she got home she did not know if she made a phone call she did not know she talked to anyone else at there after ...\nUm Mitchell also noted quote according to her letter to Dr Feinstein or to Senator Feinstein Dr Ford heard judge Kavanaugh and mark judge talking to other party goes downstairs well she was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault\nBut according to her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone um she also noted Mitchell also noted that the number of people at the party was inconsistent and kept changing um originally there were four boys at the party\nAnd that was and then there were four boys and a couple of girls\nAnd their ... and that's that's what the that's what the the trouble is and\nMitchell noted that her reasons for coming forward are inconsistent\nAh she said that a mental notes caught the person operating the tip line at the Washington Post was the first person other than her therapist or husband to disclose the identity of her alleged attacker\nShe testified that she had a sense of urgency to relate the information to the Senate and to the president she did not contact that Senate however because she claimed she did not know how to do that yeah she does not explain how she knew how to contact representative and an issue but not her senator\nUh the she can't recall and this was what kept coming up with Michel she apparently took did her polygraph the day of her grandmother's funeral or right after her grandmother's funeral and\nAh the reason that Michel focus so much on that is because she says quote it would be inappropriate to administer polygraph to someone who is grieving because polygraphs are already so unbelievably unreliable that's why they're in admissible in a court of law as any sort of evidence\nUm she also\nThere was all a win win Mitt Mitchell noted that there was some discrepancies in terms of the effect that the trauma had and she doesn't know if it was because you know the lawyers are affecting us or what it was but does she noticed there were there were twelve rather large inconsistencies and all of that\nAnd that the post article says that Kavanaugh isn't named\n... and the therapists notes\nBut yet for wants to the Senate Judiciary committee the committee to believe that Kavanaugh was named in the notes that she says are her biggest piece of evidence corroborating her story\nYet she won't give them the nose so that's huge\nShe also doesn't know during the polygraph there was a video or audio recorded\nAnd they have no idea what questions were asked\nSo this is why progressive or just attacking Rachel Mitchell um relentlessly right now\nSo I you know I it just it's a\nIt's just um inconsistent\nSo when I hear people like Lisa Bloom say well there is evidence and they're testing the testimony is inconsistent and that's according to the the third party that was brought in\nThere isn't any evidence to corroborate any of this information there isn't even to the ... named witnesses don't even corroborate a the named witnesses are actually disputing the of events and the alleged occurrence\nYet she won't give them the notes so that's huge\nShe also doesn't know if during the polygraph there was a video or audio recorded\nAnd they have no idea what questions were asked\nSo this is why progressive or just attacking Rachel Mitchell um relentlessly right now\nSo I you know I it just it's a\nIt's just um inconsistent\nSo when I hear people like Lisa Bloom say well there is evidence and there's testimony the testimony is inconsistent and that's according to the the third party that was brought in\nThere isn't any evidence to corroborate any of this information there isn't even to the ... named witnesses don't even corroborate a the named witnesses are actually disputing the of events and the alleged occurrence\nSo all of that and they're doing so on record under penalty a felony\nWhich ah that's that's pretty significant\nSo now they're ... they're Democrats or further moving the goalposts because the whole cabinet as a rapist isn't sticking Kavanaugh's a serial rapist isn't sticking him hosting gang raped and then sticking\nSo now they're trying to say oh well he was not consistent or he was um not truthful when he was discussing about his alcohol consumption so now they're moving into alcohol consumption\nBecause of rape charges aren't sticking so that's a new thing that's what they're doing this week and they're going to spend all week trying to shore up that new talking point and the

certain factions of the FBI and the higher ups there are there's an anti Trump\nFaction you know so I'm guaranteed museum in it than we think oh I Know and the Senate Democrats wanted this to happen

state which is you can't solve the problem at the same level thinking the problem was created at a you come to the point we realized that whatever it is in life you're going to try to accomplish\nIt's going to be limited if you start with the first base assumption being wrong\nSo that you a question have you ever been speaking have you ever been in place where you're speaking to someone and they're talking about something and you're going they have no idea what they're talking about their base assumption in this whole thing is completely wrong\nNow you can look at politics for example and you have the trickle down economics theory and then you have the mass wealth redistribution theory and both of those basic the Democrat and Republicans theories\nAre completely different point of view how the world really works and to this date they both keep trying to prove that their theory of economics is correct\nBut the reality is they're both off in some manner because if you let either one of the to stay in power long enough they will end up destroying society one way or the other\nBecause the base assumptions that they live by our off how much the off by well there's an old saying do you think about this I'm a different way to look at it as if you were to go\nAnd try to walk straight line\nSchool down economics theory and then you have the mass wealth redistribution theory and both of those basic the Democrat and Republicans theories\nAre completely different point of view how the world really works in to this date they both keep trying to prove that their theory of economics is correct\nBut the reality is they're both off in some manner because if you let either one of the to stay in power long enough they will end up destroying society one way or the other\nBecause the base assumptions that they live by our off how much the off by well there's an old saying do you think about this um different way to look at it as if you were to go\nAnd try to walk straight line it's almost impossible to walk a straight line and you realize that you veer off by a fraction of an inch in every stop and eventually that fraction which allows you to end up ... miles away from where he thought you're going\nTo have done experiments with this people just don't have it in their brain good walk straight the only way you can walk straight is to focus on something that's way out in front of you and walk towards it that's the only way you can walk straight you have to be focused on something that's real and that's the problem\nYour idea about finances the way you see the world\nIsn't real it's based on a mistake in theology that has been handed down from century ... century in this country\nProbably in other countries I don't know because I'm not lived there are no the the algae of their belief system but in ours I Know since I was a kid everything I've ever heard from my grandparents or great grandparents was the only way to get ahead financially is to get a great job\nThat is it\nHow do you make money you get a good job\nWork leads to money\nNow there's all kinds of derivatives off of that wrong assumption one of them is I Need to work a lot so you lose your life your life it's miserable because I was working sixty eighty hours a week when I work in corporate America\nMy wife was miserable and did I make a lot of money I mean almost no money I think I mean Seventy thousand bucks a year which is I look at it now that's nothing\nThat's almost nothing\nRight [noise]\nJust insane you know by the time you take it home to thirty five hundred dollars a month\nYet I thought it was semi successful because I had a good job I thought it was a good job but it wasn't a good job and the reason that I wasn't getting anywhere with because of the base assumption to second base assumption everybody has you need to save a little money\nOkay that's a great idea there's nothing wrong with that idea at all and that is probably a starting place for finances to be good but what is a little amount of money\nYou have a wrong assumption about what you think you can save one or two or five percent of your income and save up enough money to get richer insane when I was young my assumption\nWas I Will live on half of what I earned and every year I'll Try to earn more so I get to live at a higher\nLevel so when I made you know thirty thousand dollars a year I Lived on Fifteen when I made forty I Lived on twenty when I got to Seventy I Lived in thirty five when I got to a hundred thousand a year I Lived up fifty one I got two hundred thousand lived on a hundred and when I got five hundred dollars a year I Lived on hundred when I got two million a year I Lived on a hundred two hundred and fifty\nBecause at that point I didn't need to live on even half of it for me to have a decent life by making that different assumption to not say five or ten percent but to save half at least half\nBut what is a little amount of money you have a wrong assumption about what you think you can save one or two or five percent of your income\nAnd save up enough money to get richer insane\nWhen I was young my assumption was I Will live on half of what I earned and every year I'll Try to earn more so I get to a little bit higher\nA level so when I made you know thirty thousand dollars a year I Lived on Fifteen when I made forty I Lived on twenty when I got to Seventy I Lived in thirty five when I got to a hundred thousand a year I Lived up fifty one I got two hundred thousand lived on a hundred and when I got five hundred thousand a year I Lived on hundred when I got to a million a year I Lived on a hundred two hundred and fifty\nBecause at that point I didn't need to live on even half of it for me to have a decent life\nBy making that different assumption to not say five or ten percent but to save half at least half\nHas made me rich another assumption how large about how should you I'd never owned a home that was worth more than one year's pay\n... repeat that I've never owned a home the total do more than one year's pay\nI've never owned a home that I had to pay Thirty Years' mortgage on [noise] I bought houses I could afford to own and live in I\nHave a beautiful sixteen thousand square foot home right now paid cash for twenty car garage beautiful place cost me next to nothing compared to the income I made the year I bought it\nSo you you think about this what some ... are you living on\nA guy on the radio day talking to Dave Ramsey guy the guy had a forty thousand dollar pickup truck and he had a forty thousand dollars a year job [laughter] you don't have a home equal to what your you know so he's got a car equal to what happened is that in your salary was these are bad assumptions\nGuys really bad some what's another bad assumption another bad assumption is that college will always get you higher paying job\nThat's a bad solution in when I was growing up they had statistical data that showed if you uh graduated from high school uterine\nThirty thousand a year if you got one year of college in Utah and thirty five have yet to usually associate degree during forty or fifty if you had a four year college degree you know sixty or Seventy if you had a doctor's degree or a master's degree you can earn a hundred thousand if you had a doctor's degree could earn in a hundred and fifty thousand\n[noise] and they had the statistical data right\nBut how has that data been used to create a situation where eighty percent of our kids coming out of high school now are going into college or stupid degrees spending tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars going into debt\nTo get a degree in something they can't even get a job in\nThat's a bad assumption and the thing is interesting guys\nIs it like on the trains that what I found out this is why I'm doing the show today about this like I found it on the trains that deal when you make a bad assumption you finally get to the end of the road\nAnd you say whoa you're standing at the edge of political I can go no further with this idea it will not take me any further next step is off the cliff now you got to turn around and go back going back and sometimes more painful than struggling to get where you're at\nI have to let all the stuff go and do all this stuff I did and then figure out the right stuff to do see that's the real challenge folks isn't here you are thirty forty fifty sixty years of age and your rent that edge of that clip leading the outside going\nThat's a bad assumption and the thing is interesting guys\nIs it like on the trains that what I found out this is why I'm doing the show today about this like I found it on the trends that deal when you make a bet assumption you finally get to the end of the road\nAnd you say whoa you're standing at the edge of political I can go no further with this idea it will not take me any further next step is off the cliff now you've got to run to go back going back and sometimes more painful than struggling to get where you're at\nI have to let all the stuff go and do all this stuff I did and then figure out the right stuff to do see that's the real challenge folks is that here you are thirty forty fifty sixty years of age and you're at the edge of that clip wording of the outside going oh my God I've done it all wrong\nAnd it was just based personality failure it had nothing to do with the material have give them the same material to both\nPeople and both people were failing but there were failing in a different manner\nSo I like to talk about the difference between the type a personality type B personality\nType a personalities someone with instantaneous gratification disease they want everything they want and they want it all and then one right now and they had these needs\nTo get what they want it that they're driven when they want something they are insane uh my fiance is one of these type bass and stuff she does base theory is if she wants something shooting on her phone get on the Internet and she will shop for twenty four hours straight until she gets what you want\nI mean it's just to watch or it's ferocious now on that same side of her that ferocious when she goes into tax a problem\nLike when I sent her out to a health club or a ... apartment complex it was an operating effectively she uses same ferocious ... to attack that problem she's a problem attacker challenge\nShe gets bored so whatever it was she bought that she loves she bored with that no time at all and want something else she needs constant new stimulation to keep going\nTo\nGo further on type a personality\nType for science have basic belief systems\nOne of them is if you stick thrown up mud on the wall something's got to stick so they take the shotgun approach to doing things whatever it is they do they're doing a lot of things all the same time try to eat it all done has what happens\nWith the type a personality their weight almost everything they do\nBecause they under estimate the amount of time it takes to accomplish the ... the middle line cast between going from eight to ... to see to de they're thinking I can get all that stuff done in no time at all they want to put five things on their car to get done today and the only get one or two of them done\nAnd everything else just gets lost in the shuffle it's put off because they try to put too many things on the card at the same time another one is they don't think of the long term they don't think\nIn the means of how what will the outcome of this be\nIt's a basic belief systems one of them is if you stick thrown up mud on the wall something's got to stick so they take the shotgun approach to doing things whatever it is they do they're doing a lot of things off the same time try to get it all done has what happens\nWith the type a personality their weight almost everything they do\nBecause they under estimate the amount of time it takes to

they don't think of the long term they don't think\nIn the means of how what will the outcome of this be and should I even waste my time to them they don't care what the outcome is because what they want at that moment is instantaneously need that they have to scratch you asked have\nSo when my fiance he goes to the grocery store suspend eight hundred bucks to tell the story all the time she spent eight hundred bucks come home with enough food for a week now in her mind who's got enough food for four weeks right and she buys all this stuff she'll never cook and she freezes\nBecause there's no way it goes back to what she does it freezes it goes bad and if she freezes it we'd have read it because she never wants to take the time to take it out and bought because she's never think about what you can eat dinner when she gets up in the morning 'cause that's too far ahead for type rated thing she thinks what she wants instantly so we go out to eat\n[noise] eighty percent of the time\nSo we never use the ... it just goes bad spoils and then she secretly Throws Away she thinks I don't see are throwing it away all of a sudden it disappears and the money is wasted\nI begged her constantly when we go buying stuff put it back you don't need it you're not going to use it and if I go with the grocery store we can get down to about four hundred dollars and still have exactly the same amount of food that we eat at home because we only eat certain meals at home and the rest of the time we go out\nNow if I go by myself I'll get all of them which were the food for two hundred dollars\nAnd have the same which were the food because I don't buy all the stuff she buys we don't use in ... in each interesting because it's just the way or brain works she can't help herself\nRight it's just ... where it's a base assumption about wife if I Want something I should get it right now I Need a ... I'm an avid challenged that is when you're that focused on the current moment in life\nYou have no time to think about where the future's going to be where am I going to be a month or about six months from now year from now five years from now ten years from now there's no way of seeing that future at All right so they fail\nIn that manner they do it started thousand projects and finished none of them ever it's just the way they are they can't finish things up now you can be a and you can be a be in different topics\nI Am to be in different topics some stuff on that day I just got to do it and I started out I go get outside and they get into it in the eye burned out\nAnd find out that I did it wrong I moved too quickly I didn't have enough basic knowledge and boom there I was just like a talk about this training there I Am sitting the edge of this type a personality mistake going man I jumped into this for actually knew what I was supposed to do\nNow I've got to do something else and

it because it's going to not go down when the market goes up is a good investment whatever it may be\nIn the key thing is to me that's the wrong question the right question\nOnline training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education well important show this week we'll talk about\nOf where we are in the market cycle right now and we're going to trust them very very important questions\nAnd actually I Want to start with the first question which is probably the most common question I'm asking class in in some sort of variation in it all really comes down to this question should I buy and then name whatever it is bitcoin\nTill re Amazon apple gold whatever the question may have a variation on should I buy at it because it's going to not go down when the market goes up is it a good investment whatever it may be\nAnd the key thing is to me that's the wrong question\nThe right question is is this the right time to buy apple gold Amazon to re whatever it may be because everything is a good thing to buy when you can buy a cheap and it's a bad thing to pie when it's expensive and there's an important lesson in there we're going to get to\nBut not just knowing when to bind but knowing when to sell because there's there's miss out there that well really doesn't matter when we buy and sell I mean if you know we have a four O. one K. when we buy while we buy on payday\nWell our stocks cheap every paid in why do we do that it it does it make any sense to us to do that and and I think for most of us we think about it for about two seconds\nWould go no that's a ludicrous system the problem is we don't generally ... think about it for two seconds and this is lost one of the things that's amazing to me not to get off track already but\nYou know think about how many hours a year you spend working a writer if you're retired how many hours of the year you did spend working and most people if you work full time it's two thousand and eighty hours whatever it may be\nAnd the problem with that question is all of those things are good things to buy if you buy them at the right price the more important question isn't what should I buy it when should I buy it and then critically important when should I sell it\nAs we talked a little bit of out in the first segment you know when these companies come down they don't tend to come back up and so what we want to be able to do is identify where our stocks cheap and where are they expensive\nAnd to do that the first thing we have to be able to answer the question is what makes us stock cheap or gold cheap or two over age which is a stock in it and see\nIf you haven't followed it it's the really hot and marijuana stock which was you know up eighty dollars one day last week and then down a hundred and some dollars another day so it's it's a little volatile [laughter] okay\nPeople like the retail traders okay the people that put money into a four O. one K. and don't know what they don't they have NO PLAN for risk management\nSee there was an impression that that wealth is created in the market because everyone looks at the last price paid for a share of stock and they called the shares are worth that so for example Amazon would say is trading in two thousand dollars a share well if you sell your shares when someone for two thousand it's worth two thousand\nBut there were four hundred and eighty million shares of Amazon out there do you think they're really buyers for all of those shares it two thousand dollars a share and there are not do you think or buyers of all ... ... am seven hundred and eighty million shares of Google at twelve or Thirteen or fourteen hundred dollars a share\nAnd again I was sure you've that there are not because just to buy the stocks of those two companies will\nTake you about six percent of the entire US Economy and that's to companies are not even the biggest company which has apple so\nBe it just because there's a current price on a stock doesn't mean that all the shares will get sold for that amount of money so the idea that there's the wealth that has been created by apple is a trillion dollars simply is not true there will have to be buyers for all of those shares and what price will be paid\nSecondly if you think about it this way so\nI play it by share stock for a hundred dollars it goes to a hundred and fifty\nHow much wealth has been created\nAnd the answer is none because one if I don't sell it I don't get the fifty dollars but even if I Do where did the fifty dollars come from\nJust came from some other ... right and there's there's where's the wealth being created they're overdoing is transferring money from one pocket to another and the the problem is\nThat people don't see it that way and they don't realize how much you have to do to make sure it's going into your pocket and set out of your pocket\nThe next thing that really gets people thinking that this was wealth being created is what's called the margin dead\nPeople borrowed huge amounts of money to buy stock\nIn the United states today people part about six hundred and sixty billion dollars about three and a quarter percent of the entire US Economy to buy stocks so essentially they borrow half the money now\nThis works great when the market's going up because you get you create additional demand because that's the price of the stocks go up people get more borrowing capacity and you have this virtuous cycle you just have to kind of for the sake of of this conversation\nYou just have to maintain basically enough cash to cover half your position\nSo as long as your position is going up in value you get more borrowing power at creates more demand\nThe problem is is that you get later and a cycle and the fed starts raising interest rates the way they're doing right now and in his interest rates go up all of a sudden the margin becomes more expensive borrowing money to buy stock becomes less attractive\nThe amount of margin death starts coming down and what you're doing is you're pulling away demand\nThe price of a share of stock is determined by one thing and one thing only with somebody will sell it for and what someone who will pay for it gets all supply and demand so if you have created all this demand to drive it up that's great but when you strip that demand away\nPrice falls and price tends to fall very very quickly and again these are all things I Will cover with you in class\nBecause what happens is is if you go below a certain amount of cash for your shares your called the margin call and you basically have three days to come up with more money\nThat trade to a huge amount of supply which drives prices down again all covered this in class if you want to come to the class the classes entitled when and what to buy we're going to talk about stocks and I think it's way beyond\nMoney to buy stock becomes less attractive the amount of margin death

it's\nReally might now you forget your own power and hey let's go to my website\n\n... last year the Treasury Department says that uh there was more millionaires and billionaires made in the United

billionaires made him if the current\nYou could become a millionaire to gain knowledge on how to spend money to make money in the digital age the right way wimax show he's a Donald self I Will not be considered every Monday through friday and then right here I'm going to talk of love and hundred\nBut what we need to be able to identify with a very high degree of certainty is what are the price of the people like Warren Buffett are paying for Apple what are the prices that people like Goldman Sachs are paying for Google what are people that are buying till re okay the the people pushing that up where are those people at okay\nBitcoin you know I I'd done if I had last December I thought bitcoin was probably in trouble and from their ... corners lost a huge amount of its value why because when you know what you're looking for you can identify with a very high degree of probability\nThat something is being bought or it's being sold by people that really much control this market\nThe this is not a level playing field I mean if you think about why to Goldman Sachs do so well in their trading operations and they do great as did you guys do almost all these big institutions okay and I don't even know why say almost 'cause I Know I don't know of one that doesn't\nBut why did they do so well because they define\nWhat is cheap and what is expensive and this is really important Warren Buffett can make any stocks cheap when he buys it by making it more expensive when you buy it\nWhat he can do is through buying and selling do telling you that he just bought a stock whatever it may be he could drive the price of the stock up on his own as Ken all of these big banks and one of the things that we cover with you in classes exactly how this is done\nWe have to be able to do is look at a chart and this is whether you are shorter term trader or a longer term investor you're looking for exactly the same things but one of the things to understand is right now again if you're buying things that are expensive\nYou have to ... things that are worth buying out there but what you also have to understand as well then how do you make money\nThey do so well because they define what is cheap and what is expensive and this is really important Warren Buffett can make any stocks cheap when he buys it by making it more expensive when you buy it\nWhat he can do is through buying and selling to telling you that he just bought a stock whatever it may be he could drive the price of the stock up on his own ads can all of these big banks and one of the things that we cover with un classes exactly how this is done\nWell we have to be able to do is look at a chart and this is whether you are shorter term trader or a longer term investor you're looking for exactly the same things but one of the things to understand is right now again if you're buying things that are expensive\nYou have to ... things that are worth buying out there but what you also have to understand as well then how do you make money when they start going down\nHow do we identify what's expensive and then how do we make money either using options are doing what's called the going short\nTo actually be able to make money in market no matter what it's doing and again these are the the topics I'm In a covered in this class this is a new class it's when and what to buy it and and we're going to cover stocks recover futures will talk about currencies we'll talk about options\nBut the key of what we're going to be covering is understanding how this market really works which again is radically different than what has been sold to you I Will promise you if you come to this class you'll see the market through entirely different eyes when you walked in\nThe next thing is is we will show you how to identify when these things are cheap and when they're expensive\nAnd again we want to buy them and they are cheap or we want to sell them when they're expensive\nAnd cheap inexpensive isn't about PE ratios which by the way are ridiculously high and these things right now it's cheap means that people that drive this market are buying it and they're not buying it and hoping it goes up\nThey're going to buy it and drive it up so what we want to do is get in this close to the prices they're paying as we possibly can\nAnd the beauty of it is that they can't buy everything they want in a day they're trying to control too much money to do that so again Warren Buffett it took months to take his position and apple and that's his most recent position is that other physicians there and by the way when he told you bought those shares\nThat drove up the value of all the other shares he already own yeah he bought Seventy five million first quarter but he's got two hundred and forty million now and so he ... he is a great case study of how professionals manage this market\nAnd we can either do what the professionals are doing or get on their side of the trades or we can suffer the consequences so again what I'm going to be showing us how to identify with the highest degree of ... probability we can where we should be buying them wherever we should be selling\nAnd then critically important what do we do the cases were wrong because we're going to be wrong okay\nAnd we have to make sure that the first thing we do as manage our risk and that's a whole other thing that\nAll ... with all due respect all of you out there that think that your investors what do you do to protect yourself when the market's closed\nBecause the short answer is you know there's nothing you can do I mean you can buy put options but that you're never going to come out of that thing that whole okay\nYou're taking a phenomenal amount of risk every time the market closes so one of the things that you can think about it things that the market's open a whole lot more things like futures are currencies or things where you have some built in risk management with things like options so again we will cover all of this stuff in class\nAnd this isn't you know again if you want to be a day trader you can do this was day trader you\nAlso do it though is a longer term trader I'm a longer term person All right and and I'm doing everything I Do and and I raise um focus more on wealth building but you can also do this is a way to how do I put some\nWe do is manage our risk and that's a whole another thing that all ... with all due respect to all of you out there that think that your investors what do you do to protect yourself when the market's closed\nBecause the short answer is you there's nothing you can do I mean you can buy put options but that you're never going to come out of that thing the whole okay\nYou're taking a phenomenal amount of risk every time the market closes so one of the things that you can think about it things that the market's open a whole lot more things like futures are currencies or things where you have some built in risk management with things like options so getting rule cover all of this stuff in class\nAnd this isn't you know again if you want to be a day trader you can do this was day trader you can also do it though is a longer term trader I'm a longer term person All right and and I'm doing everything I Do and and I raise um focus more on wealth building but you can also do this is the way to how do I put some more money in my pocket every day or every week\nSo if you want to come out to class and brand new class you get to free tickets and free tablet plus we will feed you launch be\nOne of the next dozen callers\nAt

T. A. as in online training academy two three one nine nine six\nTo kind of circle back around to what I was talking about when you buy things when they're cheap and you sell them when they're expensive you tend to do better than if you bought them when they were expensive\nThe way the math is working right now there are a couple of a number of indicators out there that suggests that the rate of return for the stock market for the vine hold investor for the next eight to ten years depending on the metric is likely to be something less than one percent or perhaps even negative we'll talk more about that after the break [noise]\nHi this is Ken and you're on the right side of the trade between the black helicopters and CNBC there's the right side of the trade the right side of the trade is brought to buy online training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years as the world's most trusted name in professional trader education at the end of the\nSegment I mentioned that there are a number of indicators out there that suggests that stock market returns over the next eight eight to ten years will be something less than one percent especially when\nNegative we'll talk more about that after the break [noise]\nHi this is Ken and you're on the right side of the trade between the black helicopters and CNBC\nThere's the right side of the trade thrived side of the trade is raw to buy online training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years as the world's most trusted name him professional trader education at the end of the last segment I mentioned that there are a number of indicators out there that\nSuggests that stock market returns over the next eight eight to ten years will be something less than one percent especially once considered inflation they may even be negative\nAnd people will say well you know that just can't happen we we've never seen anything like that oh no you've seen that a lot of times there's a lot of times where for even twenty and Thirty years the marketed centrally goes nowhere but\nEven if you just go back to when the ... in two thousand okay if you look at between two thousand and two thousand and sixteen this was before the election when the market was Crimea went way down in two thousand and eight and when the way down to two thousand but it came back a couple of times\nIf you look at the rate of return after inflation over those sixteen or Seventeen years the market actually was up about a half a percent a year\nAnd most people can't make it on a half percent a year\nEven where the market is today from two thousand to about ... about where we are right now the market's up less than four percent a year now this is with the longest bull market run in history this is with the you know ridiculously high evaluations on many different metrics\nThe idea that the market is going to continue to double or triple from here without taking some pretty big hits along the way I think is well let's just call it optimistic\nNow again these things can happen in the market can grow higher go higher but there's two things I guess I Would think about one is wouldn't it be useful to know if the market so I couldn't move higher at any given time and then also to know if it's not how can you actually make money when it goes down\nAnd again these are the ideas that I'm going to be covering in class when and what to buy its it say the focus is really on the when piece of it you can make money buying and selling anything if you buy that the right price and sell it at the right price\nBut how do you identify what is the right price\nThere's you can argue that Amazon has been overvalued forever and it has and it continues to get more overvalued and it can continue to do so but there have been opportunities along the way to buy Amazon at what would be a cheap price\nCompared to where you could have sold it at a more expensive price as we talked about earlier with apple\nApple for Twenty years went absolutely nowhere and yet there were tremendous money making opportunities and apple if you knew when to buy and if you knew when to sell and the whole key is\nAbsolutely nowhere and yet there were tremendous money making opportunities and apple if you knew when to buy and if you knew when to sell and the whole key is\nBy any of the more value looking or visit ... living dot com
