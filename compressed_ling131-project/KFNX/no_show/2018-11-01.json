almost reached his breaking point\nSo you're ... where I Want to hear I think I understand what you're saying you're saying you're agreeing with me that in this case is your husband is it a breaking point from the hatred towards white people\nYes yes and he doesn't understand that it's like why do you want a blessed to be a white person and again you can say he's biracial he's half Hispanic and half white but he doesn't understand this all he wants his people to do what they're supposed to do\nAnd do when you can't tell me on the air what your husband's says but I think you're implying he's reaching a point of exploding isn't that what you're saying\nYes he is and he's he's in his retirement years he teaches firearms training and people are becoming are getting to the point where they're feeling that they're they're ... has to be defended just to go on just to go onto the street anymore he's feeling that he's becoming a target when he\nIs low I I understand that very well and he is I

so generic as against all white males know\nAbsolutely and and thank goodness there's apply there is a platform for people to a release their their anger and and again you get to the point what are you going to do about it I mean what what can we do I appreciate you telling us we're going to boycott everybody and their brother were trying to vote\nNo no that doesn't work they wouldn't do anything\nUnless it's targeted at a conservative these um these companies will not do a thing they only target conservatives\nI agree uh I I've seen this my entire career but um\nCan you tell us some

violence ... violence prone\nWell and and like like with with my husband he basically everybody he knows he wants them to be proficient and firearms he just feels he feel if we're going to get into a war or not a race war but we're going to get into a liberal versus conservative war\nSo he fears a political civil war\nYes yes\nYeah but it's it's breaking down on racial lines because of CNN\nYet it absolutely is but again that in in the broad picture my my husband my husband that's that's the bad thing about it my husband has and myself we have friends of all nationality\nSo it it's almost to that point are conservative friends that are black Hispanic Asian they feel the same way he does so he feels almost\nAs if they feel powerless when they let ... arriving maniac racist like this on CNN stoke the flames of hatred yes\nYes and there's there's no way to stop them how do we\nFeels he feel are going to get into a war or not a race war but we're going to get into a liberal versus

down stop the hatred\nWe know that the media actually is inciting the the violence in nature and the country we know that it's a clear fact\nWe also know they're out of control we all also know that they need to be censored as they once were there was a time the media was censored in this country Hollywood was censored before one censorship entered and the the filth from Brooklyn entered into a Hollywood the lowest form of humanity\nThe drug addicts went to Hollywood they brought the worst mentality that are movies that ever seen the most violent the most perverse there are no controls whatsoever on Hollywood and since there's now a an overlap between the news and a Hollywood you're getting the same mentality running the news media that's really what's happening\nThe intellect and corporate directly ships which I've talked about for a long time so I Can't control at all I can do with control my own thoughts you understand that that's all I can do you think I don't rage warfare you'd think I don't go crazy sometimes and say things I Would never say on the air you'd be mistaken I Do I'll admit it but you're never going to hear what I say\nYou're never going to get what I say because I'm a human being just like you are\nBut I Know too limited you don't bring it to the public airwaves like CNN which this ...\nAnd if men as no self control to know why you control themselves they have to control it it's that simple show you know I'm going to do in January apart cast at a radio show which I Am a head of the curve big trend now that I started it's going to be a a a hybrid one hour of radio in some markets two hours\nThe interlocking corporate directors ships which I've talked about for a long time so I Can't control at all I can do with control my own thoughts you

never going to hear what I say\nYou're never gonna hear when I say because I'm a human being just like you are\nBut I Know to limit you don't bring it to the public airwaves like CNN let this jerk do\nAnd if a man has no self control and no I used to control themselves they have to control it it's that simple so you know I'm going to do in January a podcast and radio show it's I I met head of the curve it's a big trend now that I started it's going to be a a a hybrid one hour of radio in some markets two hours of radio\nIn some markets know hours of radio because they don't want me on the

just cooked lunch and had breakfast lunch at the same time in that fight that long break\nI went to the radio catch and I was starving again\nI didn't want to eat that garbage Chinese food one more

the ... I got to go back to my ... dying that money and I was once a very austere in my eating habits I weighed a hundred and thirty pounds I ran up hills that was a long time ago but I mean I Know enough not to eat that poisoned every day from these Chinese restaurants anyone would know that the salt in the garbage they put an\nLet alone the low quality of seafood so I looked in the refrigerator you heard the radio station you know what I made for lunch I mean to tell you what I Would do in a park yes I took took two little strips of uh smoked salmon put them in a frying pan fry them slightly through two eggs on top of them a NATO to crack is\nThat why are you telling me this when there's so many important things in the world because I feel like it\nUntil I'm told that I cannot talk about what I ate for lunch I Will not stop talking about what I had for lunch\nSo I think his favorite segment is going to be in part cash from time to time like lunch with them having for lunch that day other foods either dogs don't me as the food guy\nWhen the missus wants to get the dogs attention she says she comes to food guy\nI've known as the ... they lowered the little dogs when they see me come and they know and that way of like my mother I like to see everyone happy and eat a lot\nI killed one dog like this year's ago poor snowy overfed her she was forty pounds overweight when I got through with her that I take her away from now we gave her way to someone\nShe put and put her on a diet she was near death but she lived an extra two years up on a ranch because they fed or a dog diet not my diet not Petty's Fifteen\nTall right she's mixed he's got a mixed dog and human diet I Can't help myself he looks at me I Can't help it I give them a little bit of steak a little this with the with the dog food but the coughing now probably blew out his arteries from it who knows [noise]\nI'll be back to talk about news user\nReviews you don't want to hear right here on the Savage Nation\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no heat by five four hundred and seven eight bucks for four hundred and seven to eight to [noise]\nTwo years up on a ranch because they federal dog diet not my diet that Chinese Fifteen\nAlright she's mixed he's got a mixed dog and human diet I Can't help myself he looks at me I Can't help but I gave them a little bit of steak a little this with the with the dog food but the coughing now probably blew out his arteries from it who knows [noise]\nI'll be back to talk about news views are reviews\nYou don't want to hear right here on the Savage Nation\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no heat by by four hundred seven eight by ... for a number seven to eight to [noise]\nSo I once said that when my kids were growing up they loved Halloween they always did they still do I guess I remember my son said to me that the kids love it you know give it a break\nAnd at the end of the day I Love seeing the children running around you know tonight with the costumes and the thing I don't like is the food that they give them the poison candy is unbelievable\nThe you know what all that sucrose does to your child's brain how could you be so ignorant of the relationship between all of that poison and and they behave you the next day many of the mothers a stupid and the children I watch them\nI watch in the suburbs of fathers and mothers they look intelligent they look clean cut but most of them are stupid there was nothing as the children first of all they walk around the streets with alcohol in their hands in the suburbs it's a big thing I don't know if it didn't ... I Can't believe that the kids are running around getting high on sugar and the parents are running around high up tequila in the same street\nSo that's the world we live in like Brazil it's like a holiday in Brazil like something to do with corn eight\nEight celebrity costumes that sparked outrage confusion what if I tell you I hate celebrities I think that they're all mentally ill and they should be in a mental hospital first of all most of them are in mental hospitals in and out number one can you imagine being a celebrity fulltime that you have to be in the news every minute on on on Instagram can you imagine living\nThat you have to take a picture of yourself here I Am in the toilet you're in the shower here I Am taking a picture myself here I Am on a yacht enjoying myself have you ever seen what these dumb women do\nAnd the dumb and have you looked at how stupid they are have you seen how idiotic they are every minute under boob under this under boom under this anything to get an immediate and stupid the point is the children watch this\nAnd they ate the behavior in the children become dumb like the celebrities does it stop them from doing it know am I entitled to talk about it yes\nWill change anything will I make one more on a starlet for one second pause taking a picture of herself as watching the show last night on TV I stopped watching Netflix it's an addiction I got addicted to Netflix all admitted it started with the a thing on the ...\nThat you have to take a picture of yourself here I Am in the toilet you're in the shower here I Am taking a picture myself here I Am on a yacht enjoying myself\nHave you ever seen what these dumb women do and the dumb and have you looked at how stupid they are have you seen how idiotic they are every minute under boob under this under boob under this anything to get in the media and stupid the point is the children watch this\nAnd they ate the behavior in the children become dumb like the celebrities does it stop them from doing it know am I entitled to talk about it yes\nWill change anything and I make one more on a starlet for one second pause taking a picture of herself as watching the show last night on TV I stopped watching Netflix it's an addiction I got addicted to that's what it's all admitted it started with the a thing on the Mexican drug lord a El Chapo\nLittle did I Know the next thing we a Turkish police drama\nThen I got hooked on enough French police drama I Can't stop it they they ... I'm watching every I don't even leave the house that's why I'm starting to look like Charles Manson my hair is growing there's nowhere to go I finished your radio show eat dinner and watch TV and because there are no ads I prefer a Netflix that's sort of answer and ruin it\nI don't even watch cable anymore I see there are killing them I used to watch a movie on HBO no more\nAll they got his that said you know government media complex adjuster I don't watch them a Showtime nothing is never a good movie on All right so I watch Netflix or one that I liked the foreign dramas\nAnd last night I I that was the end of it I I couldn't take it anymore\nI ...

saying that kind how could these guys be so stupid as the hate Donald Trump so much\nSo this guy the guy who looked like with the handled the guitarists I never book does act there are characters Sopranos I liked\nHe was not one of them I never was convinced that he was convincing All right so it turns out that he conned someone and to making a series years ago ... about a mob guy who was on the lam and he chooses to go to Norway\nFinland I don't know no way no it it's kind of funny in in concept and it's hit and miss it's not that good but you stick with it because some of it is good and I like the the snow and the trains and the scenery and I just want to see something different I'm watching what finally last that I had enough\nI said this is garbage this is such trash why do they even make it so I got man and went back to regular television and I watched um what was I saying before before the eggs are going to my head now I watch the um below decks which is about life on the table or seen it on bravo right\nClinton you ever watched that below decks once in a while\nNow you heard about it's about the crew you know and the captain\nAnd you're supposed to have a vicarious thrill like you're on a yacht\nHaving been on yachts I can tell you that it's hogwash it's all acted the whole thing is scripted but you get a peek at some of the most beautiful boats on earth and that's nice and at the end of the day you realize what a boring life it is so last night's episode was some\nGuy from Silicon Valley with is ugly girlfriend and a group of people and they rent a boat or buy two hundred and fifty thousand bucks a week\nThat's what they cost would you leave it to fifty three hundred thousand plus costs plus a tip no less the kind of money All right so they come aboard\nThe next thing you know every second the guy as a uh\nLife on a yacht you've all seeing it on bravo right Clinton you ever watched that below decks once in a while\nNow you heard about it's about the crew you know and the captain\nAnd you're supposed to have a vicarious thrill like you're on a yacht\nHaving been on yachts I can tell you that it's hogwash it's all acted the whole thing is scripted but you get a peek at some of the most beautiful boats on earth and that's nice and at the end of the day you realize what a boring life it is so last night's episode was some\nGuy from Silicon Valley with is ugly girlfriend and a group of people and they rent a boat or about two hundred and fifty thousand bucks a week\nThat's what they cost would you leave it to fifty three hundred thousand plus costs plus a tip no less a ton of money All right so they come aboard\nThe next thing you know every second the guy as a a camera in his face they're all taking pictures themselves they're obsessed with social media\nThey're sitting in a chair the cameras rolling they're having a drink the cameras rolling during the hot tub with the cameras how do people live like this and why would anyone care to watch that I asked myself but anyway\nI watched it for about Fifteen minutes with with interest because I'm an employer I Need a vacation between writing the book stop mass hysteria\nBetween nervously awaiting for it to come out amongst too late\nIf that book it come out in August that would've been a number one bestseller on the New York times was everyone knows that but unfortunately that's how it came out\nIt came out with the heaviest competition that any publisher has ever seen I have three different publishers said to me the day that stop mass hysteria came out it was heading into the heaviest winds they've ever seen in the history of publishing\nThat it made it to number Lebanon list as a miracle unto itself in the loyalty the audiences are overwhelming but nevertheless ah after the book and the book launching the promotion\nAnd now the election I haven't had a minute's rest I haven't had a vacation and and what I'm starting a new career in January would you leave that\nI'm always starting something new I never asked I'm like the true Rolling Stone\nI really I don't get her anymore so I'll tell you that so I Am starting a brand new career at this point in my life which is amazing most people would have retired so you don't want to hell with it I don't want it in a more enough already they don't want me on this station they want me on that station or start something new what do I need it for\nBut I'm going to give the part casting a shot because that's absolutely the future of broadcasting everybody knows that podcasting is going to be to the spoken word what cable became\nChew the visual image remember there was first broadcast television and every two minutes there was an ad\nAnd then people came up with cable and then you also watching cable because there were no ads in the beginning remember that one party casting is sort of like that with the ads are interspersed in much fewer\nAnd much freer form and there's going to be a hybrid because I don't want to leave broadcast radio I Love broadcast radio like you're listening to me now on almost three hundred stations across America most of them have program directors who are smart enough to carry the show in the one or two hour form it's not true everywhere some of them\nHave such a political hatred for me that you will not be able to hear me in their market I Know

I Believe than for ... and I believe more now was not at all a friend of Israel\nAnd in fact I believed and I still believe that Brock a bomb in a way despised Israel and he worked against Israel you know we've always had this dynamic in America with our president's\nIt's like there's a fight going on over there a fight between Israel and the Palestinians and America has got to be like the referee\nWere like the mediator right in between these two warring factions and that's the role that every American president has pretty much play until Obama\nNow that's a dynamic that I'm I I don't uh uh uh approve of\nUh and that's a dynamic will get into Trump in a minute that's a dynamic that Trump does not participate in either but it's always been that way Republican Democrat president\nUh you don't take sides you want to bring peace so it's like a boxing match you got the Palestinians in that corner you got Israel in that corner in the American president is the referee\nThen along comes Obama and\nIt was clear during the eight years of the Obama administration that Iraq Obama was not the referee he wasn't\nThe guy in the middle of the ring he wasn't some objective a broker for peace he was not some mediator now Brock Obama comes along\nAnd he's the first president at least in my lifetime who pick the corner\nHe picked aside and then it wasn't Israel\nBrock Obama through his deeds his words in his actions made clear that he pretty much sided with the Palestinians\nHe viewed as\nThe left in this country views Israel as and oppressor\nAn occupier\nAnd Obama viewed the Palestinians as the left in America views the Palestinians as the poor oppressed innocent people\nThat's the way Obama talked\nWhen you look at Obama's policies visa v the middle east every every day

friend of Israel so I considered it my duty\nTo fill that vacuum\nI considered at my duty to let Israel know that America still stands with her I was part of a big freshman class of Republican congressmen a lot of evangelical Christians in that class huge supporters of Israel\nI went to Israel I saw some things everything I saw only reinforced my beliefs\n\nThat there will not be peace in the middle east as long as the Palestinians are the Palestinians period\nBut I spent those two years in DC trying to be as loud\nA and as for ... for us\nAnd as out spoken of a supporter of Israel's as I could be\nI did that because I Believe it was the right thing to do I did that because my religion teaches me that about Israel and the Jewish people I did that because Israel is our greatest ally on the planet I did that\nUh because Israel is like this little tiny speck of good in a sea of of Islamic evil in that part of the world I did that philosophically because Israel is generally a free open prosperous country\n\nBut I also did what I did when I was in Congress being a very vocal supporter of Israel\nBecause I recognized that that's not what we had in the White House in ... rock bottom\nAnd it was important to me almost every week\nTo lead Israel now that America's still stood with her even if the president does\n\nThe United States Congress still stands with you Israel even
