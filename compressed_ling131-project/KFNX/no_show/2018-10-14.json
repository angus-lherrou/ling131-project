and said mom I really need help with my ...\nI said well honey I really can't help you that much with your ... but by the way how much does it\nAnd when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident\nAnd I said ... you have a little tiny house how is your purview however build these so high\nI sit there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and ... and ... he has a PS mentor people had some dues or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake cutting let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nSecret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management and let me talk about that with the owner built this thing called demanded a lot of people an atheist this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe Thirteen point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hottest I'm of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat\nIt could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hardest time of the day between three and have him and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies in a monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest some of the day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\nThere's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it so the smart energy management the way that you know gee the people like like that I've been told\nIs remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance Monday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist no matter when we called made long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when it's hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for a home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars um it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nAbout it is ... it's criminal\nUm I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you anymore so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's going to continue to go off\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them\nAnd I explain all this to them so not only are you paying between seven and half of neat and have since for your kill a lot on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying two words the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus the electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase and the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us sorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um\nIt it just it doesn't make sense for them they can you remember rates everybody should just call you just find out how to read\nTheir bill and then I don't know how to read their ... and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if he goes why didn't I Do the sooner I write so many people who will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site ... I Do a rate I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year\nAnd a half and today there is out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to click on a time and then they go home now I understand what she runs and so no judgments\nBut at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simply this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here\nKit down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half and then the natives out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go home now you understand what she runs\nAnd so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon and gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and pay two fifty and that's essentially Carol\nI'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS Messer piece rate puns today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home we use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid the power company\nCut that in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money\nWell here's what we're gonna do we want to give out your phone number because everyone really

Advantage plan um or changed their prescription drug plan is to have a standalone prescription drug plan they can change to that as well\nAnd we have a lot of people money and when we say about the

said we have to vote for mix Sally I I Can't stand the site of her but\nShe'll get my vote this time maybe maybe that may be in six years I might be ready to run against or cause\nThe reality is the season for six years the only person that's gonna really be able to take her off the market would be somebody of my nature and then what happens is\nI got these people saying well you need to kind of calm down on the radio because you know they they they could do what they did the blame it on what I say on the radio is one hundred percent your patriotism\nGot the ages of pages but I get you and I and I got it covered a little bit with cabinet shop and all but the ... he had to read swearing in the second one in front of the public and he basically said cabinet officers and that that that's the

Democrat Party it's all a steel\nAnd they're both clapping the American people let me move on because there's a lot of stuff I Want to get through 'cause I got to get through some of the there's new stuck with the deep state you also saw this kill a branch she was hanging around with Linda SARS saw at the stupid thing and she sang in her out so you people knew your idiots\nYou are idiots in my home state where I grew up\nWhere I was born I wouldn't go back there if you paid me I wouldn't even put a damn concert on at the Madison Square garden ever again I never will do that ever I I Can't believe what New York and I hope people wake up in New York California seems to be there's a little bit of movement\nPossibly at let's not get too excited out there 'cause they're cheaters just like they are in Arizona that's what I worry about in the election is the broad a voting you also had that astronaut Scott Kelly he made a a\nA a Winston Churchill statement on tweet on Twitter and a ... cat and he said he apologizes that little squirt he's a little live boy anyway so you know these these are the losers that we have to deal with you at the limousine crash a\nBack east right and all of a sudden now we need new regular more regulations right more rules and regulations when probably the breaks in work and it was the people's fault not not because of a wreck you ration\nI Know how those people run those have passed\nA limousine services especially back east\nBelieve me you got and I mean do you ever drive with people back east and limos or even cabs you you're you're damn well better put a damn seatbelt gone the way they bunch of uh you know if that's all you have to drive back there\nBut does more regulations do you see how the lab is and then broadening Rosen's scene here that we're doing this\nHe got a free pass card and got a free ride on your dime and my dime on air force one with Trump last week I'm going to get into that in a in a minute I told you about Romney coming out that should be an indication\nAnd what else I add one more story I wanted to get to you guys oh by the way I forgot I mean there's just shot into my head while you're not being told is is that the Democrat Party is also pushing for\nAmnesty for twenty two million\nIllegal aliens see this is going on behind closed doors behind your back because what you keep hearing isn't ... men and men this investigation well they want twenty two million people\nRegulations do you see how the lab is and then Claude neat rows and skiing here that we're doing this\nHe got a free pass card and got a free ride on your dime and my dime on air force one would talk last week I'm going to get into that in a in a minute I told you about Romney coming out that should be an indication and what else I add one more story I wanted to get to you guys oh by the way\nI forgot I mean there's just shot into my head while you're not being told is is that the Democrat Party is also pushing for\nAmnesty for twenty two million\nIllegal aliens see this is going on behind closed doors behind your back because what you keep hearing isn't beach men and men this investigation well they want twenty two million people that will give him amnesty\nSo that's another thing that you want to listen to because it just never ever in\nWitness wrecking machine you had a pastor Brunson free from turkey can cost us a dime or did you see I had to go look at it it it it it'll give you damn\nUh till goose bumps or the back of your neck is uh he's saying in a prayer for Don he's got his hand on Don one copy talk it's hilarious 'cause it's like looking at my old man\nWhen it comes to church I Know Don loves God and all but I Know these old New York guys and and he's sitting there and its whole areas because I mean you know he's found themselves [noise] uh and then you had Mrs Trump\nRight she went on her I mean how many people can do stories this quick I just rattle through twenty five stories and like what\nBy not even five minutes and you read the interview with Mrs Trump and they're asking or white issue where the jacket and [noise] oh how was your marriage since Donny how many times that I explained she doesn't care if he goes around she doesn't even sleep with a guy anymore why do you think he's going around\nAsking these Mary guys the old ladies are giving it to what do you think about going around and most of the wife will tell them go do it I don't want to do with you anymore you don't turn me on believe me I Know women and they told me I Know women in and out\nHad literally that was a bad thing to say but the reality is I Know women I have a lot of friends that are women and they\nTell me dang and ah I tell them things that they've probably laugh at me\nBut a lot of women that are married they don't give you ran out there no you ain't getting on so in some of them they just go home and cars and got the money but these are millionaires they said oh was it they got the money to go get a room they got the money to go get whoever they want they have their part and that's it\nBig deal he loves his wife his wife is a woman and you heard what she said\nWhat a good we're fine I Love them so\nYou people just don't know how it is in the real world of uh entertainment I guess you would say or in the real world out there I Wish everybody could be believe it to beaver\nFamily where do you go to ... there are a great family that are never there's good people out there and just because the guy mess around her and make them a bad guy I I\nDon't think it's why but just because he does that ate it that's his only weakness as long as the old lady doesn't find out about it you know that I I I really don't know what to tell you want a situation like that I mean me I Would tell my kids don't do it\nBut you know you're going to go tell some millionaire don't do it he's going to laugh in your face and do it anyway so you as all these media it's always about sex sucked sucked cookbooks\nRight but it's okay for that piece of garbage Keith Ellison to beat the hell out of a woman and we get nothing out of that and I'm sure\nIn the real world out there I Wish everybody could be believed it to beaver family where you go to ... there are a great family that are never there's good people out there just because the guy mess around and make them a bad guy I I\nDon't think it's white but just because he does that eight if that's his only weakness as long as we all lady doesn't find out about it you know that I I really don't know what to tell you what a situation like that I mean me I Would tell my kids don't do it\nBut you know you're going to go tell us a millionaire don't do it he's going to laugh in your face and do it anyway so you as all these media it's always about sex sucked sucked cookbooks\nRight but it's okay for that piece of garbage Keith Ellison to beat the hell out of a woman and we get nothing out of that and I'm sure some idiot like that that beats on a woman because a man that beats on a woman as a piece of garbage in my book U.S Britain powered\nOkay and if they're beating on a woman don't tell me they're not raping them\nSo their whole probably hold them down when they tell them no and they make 'em do it anyway so and I bet you they have that on Keith hours [noise] so let's see what happens because there's a lot of things going down there trying to get the sexual thing out of commission the mob squad throughout\nI mean you were living in times right now ladies and gentlemen that were going on and the very late sixties early seventies same type of\nBehavior and the time has come you ... like I told you you got to Trump at some point is going to have to pull the trigger literally send troops into these riots like Ronald Reagan did at Berkeley many years ago and so be it up a few people out to get killed to settle the people down then\nYou have to do what you have to do to get ... on the street again there's no respect I mean you got people running around in black suits or their masks over their face running up to old ladies\nAnd threatening screaming at that could be your mother could you imagine somebody doing that in front of my mother died that'd be it\nI'd be in jail that I'm Sorry to tell you and I know that your listeners out there would be sitting in jail too ah I'm sure you've seen the video where the old ladies are waving the flag and they grab the flag and they drag 'em down the street so as I say and I'm going to get off this kick because\nIt no repercussions\nThat's why you have the nuts running the same asylum it's ... it's a very simple process and it's just like we watch on a one flew over the cuckoo's nest that's what's going on right now\nAnd the government they don't care and go do whatever you want and meanwhile uh we have the media and the establishment or you have a slate and\nA ... John Casey that low like what he's going to run and two thousand he is a joke [noise] he is a lie he is a weak little nothing\nOkay so you know I wouldn't worry about anybody coming out of debt you guys are just like no I Hope somebody wrong you sure the hell are running against him Jeff Flake\nYou'll be laughed at you can't even get reelected in your own damn state it you're going to run for president I think he realized he went\nHe went to that little meeting right to go talk to the team was booed he'll be boots on any stage III walks on I think it hit it said that the American people don't accept the piece of garbage like that if I was him I'd go get my damn knows sticks\nBecause his nose is crooked and he is he's the son of a bitch and America in the Arizona people cannot wait till January when he steps down\nGoing to want him to doubt that he is a joke he is why he is a weak little nothing okay so you know I wouldn't worry about anybody coming out of that you got a job like no I Hope somebody ... I'm sure the hell are running against them up like\nYou'll be all out of that you can't even get reelected in your own damn skate and you're going to run for president I think he realized he went\nHe went to that little meeting right to go talk to the people who he'll be boots on any stage ... I think it did it at that you make of people don't accept a piece of garbage like that if I was when I go get my ... knows because\nHis nose is crooked as he is he's the son of a bitch and America and yeah we're going to people cannot wait till January when he steps down I'll be right back [noise]\n\nUh you know that that I I mean so he's dealing with people from Perkins Louis a fusion GPS lawyers Christopher Steele I guess all this stuff is just as hunky dory and it's also okay because\nYou know we're not supposed to find out about it which brings to meet you Christopher Wray I'll get it even back into a little bit more on the schemes Baker thing but this Christopher Wray really pissed me off this week when they're asking hey he needs to be fired\nDirectly immediately after white along with sessions Rosen scene and Mueller right after the election this is the bull crap at this point in time they have nothing and we're giving these people millions of dollars and it's bull crap take them I'd rather take the money and give it to uh the core American Kids that are needy\nAnd stop worrying about illegal aliens we don't need a Mueller hasn't found anything it should be fired and that is it now what I think is going on\nIs ... knows what he's doing we know that you know 'cause I Know you people he's got a plan you got to plan that the plan is what we all want as America but less weight ... obviously we're waiting 'til after the election fraud\nBut you notice last week he refused to go to these hearings to be asked questions why because he'll be under oath it's always okay for him to go and sit and have a cup of coffee\nRight with whoever he was one of the Congress men one of the senators he could even go have a cup of coffee with Donald Trump and say I never said that er [noise] I was joking around\nI'd rather take the money and give it to uh the poor American Kids that are needy and stop worrying about illegal aliens we don't need a Mueller hasn't found anything we should be fired and that is it now what I think is going on\nIs ... knows what he's doing we know that you know 'cause I Know you people he's got the plan you got the plan that the the plan is what we all want as America but less weight ... obviously we're waiting 'til after the election these broad\nBut you notice last week he refused to go to these hearings to be asked questions why because there'll be under oath it's always okay for him to go and sit and have a cup of coffee\nRight where through every last one of the Congress men one of the senators he could even go I have a cup of coffee with Donald Trump and say I never said that her I was joking around\nIt it it was just a joke I I didn't mean it every time with a and and you also notice he didn't answer that any of the questions from Matt aid or Jordan that had to do with the signing of the fight the report when he was at the last year so there should be an indication\nOf exactly what the hell is going on out there and I don't and you know we're sick of it we know we're not dumb Donald Trump maybe what it's going to happen in the after the election that Monday after the election maybe Wednesday morning I don't know\nAh maybe we'll see people get escorted out in handcuffs or the way it works I Know you can go yeah right\nAnd I'm saying the same thing yeah right it's not going to happen but in a in the white world it\nWould happen what what has to happen is the same thing that happened to Bill Cosby needs to be scraping handcuffs in front of the damned public okay and\nI and I also heard I guess a Cosby is a fire the lawyers and they're going to appeal it with a new it's too late at this point in time and maybe maybe get less time 'cause he's an old guy but if you did what the hell they said he did he needs to be said you don't drug for people to I mean that's like I said\nI have no problem you want to be ... years person in the world when it comes to sex I have absolutely no problem with it but it's got to be a agreed with both parties you can't just get somebody uh give somebody drugs and let them pass out and then kick it that's bull crap I have daughters for Christ's sake and that's bull crap\nAnd humid out there that have daughters if you and your men out there that have sons what would you like that happening to your mother\nSo start thinking about crap like that that's the kind of people we need to get when we take them and we put them in jail and I also heard that that date drug I didn't even know there's a couple of my friends or their women\nTold me that I guess downtown Scottsdale a they\nPut the roof I call them rupees I guess that's what they did it in in my time that's what they call it but I uh the date drug or whatever they call that crap or that shows you how a blade I Am on that but I 'cause I don't go out and public I stay out of public places I'm not like the other people I don't really like to go like Trump's coming to town writes\nI don't even know if I'm going if I Can't get in a special way I'm not gonna even try to go because I don't want to deal with uh like I did last time with this anti uh and the whole I don't have time for any trouble\nI'm here to save the country and all I needed to be hitting ad with a baseball bat or something and then be wiped out for a couple of weeks I don't need so\nIs where we're at basically on this whole awe ordeal but like I said we know that Rodney is involved a hundred percent and the things that we learned and I brought it up on blonde show the other the other day was that you know with James Baker\nPaul that crap that shows you how a blade I Am on that but I 'cause I don't go out in public I stay out of public places I'm not like the other people I don't really like to go like Trump's coming to town right\nI don't even know if I'm going up I Can't get in a special way I'm not going to even try to go because I don't want to deal with uh like I did last night with his aunt she's a and the whole I don't have time we're in trouble\nI'm here to save the country and all I needed to be hit with a baseball bat or something and then be wiped out for a couple of weeks I don't need so\nThat is where we're at basically on this whole ordeal but\nLike I said we know that Rodney is involved a hundred percent and the things that we learned and I brought it up on Broadway show the other the other day was that you know with James Baker is that he do he did he dealt with the Democrats and he told me straight up he dealt with the Democratic sunny\nAh you know so ... what's up with that [noise]\nWent in in the meeting board the coup\n... so you know and when you have three people saying that Rosen steam it wasn't joking around about it and you know that we heard that rose and seeing as a temper and we know I Wonder if they searched Rosen being real wire when he got on air force one the other day\nI Would trust that son of a bitch as far as I could but I mean let me put it to us playing sports if this guy was involved with my unit when we tore the guy would be fired because\nOf just lack of royalty that's one thing what I have people that work I work for me at anything if they're not loyal to me personally but gone\nAnd that's it that's the one thing you have to learn or like what I mean by loyal that doesn't mean you could stand up and tell me I'm wrong but I'm loyal to people I Would never ever go to the media and\n... and and squeal out Ninety nine percent of my friends that I could without much money I could make it right it started saying half the stuff about half the people that I Know\nI'm not like that I don't give a damn it none of my business it's none of your business if somebody else wants good great but that's our problem today just like the media oh Donald Trump he doing porn stars\nYou people are doing hookers off the damn street so what's the difference\nIt's completely out of control and I will be right back [noise]\n\n\n\n[laughter]

laugh a renegotiating NAFTA doesn't affect them they said he couldn't do it\nPutting China back on its tail doesn't matter\nUm unemployment historic lows doesn't matter\nThere's no there's no pressing that left so I think he's right don't try to please the left do the right thing makes sure Florida is taking care of a it's a judgment call I could've gone either way on that frankly but it is pretty it's pretty hard\nSo my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours already otherwise it would have been really unfair all of the people that were way they were talking about thousands and thousands of people\nHave five five forty Laura [noise] uh what could have done what can he do to satisfy the left I mean look at Fort Point two percent GDP is not satisfying the left are renegotiating NAFTA doesn't affect them they said he couldn't do it\nPutting China back on it feels doesn't matter\nUm unemployment historic lows doesn't matter\nThere's no there's no impressing that left so I think he's right don't try to please the left do the right thing makes sure Florida is taking care of a it's a judgment call I could have gone either way on that frankly but\nIt is pretty it is pretty hard when you have all these people there and you you have taken care of business in Florida you got FEMA on it you got all the emergency station set up they're being given all the support they need and you're back in what two hours\nIt's it's I think it would have been a tougher call if it were in like Minnesota or California\nThen it's five hours out five hours back but it's not like the president isn't constantly on the phone I mean he does have world class communication on air force one this is not like he's checked out of the hurricane but again you're not pleasing these people let's go to Dennis in Florida\nWest Palm Beach Florida where I just was over the weekend Dennis that red tide\nI'm not talking about the kind we want was brutal I got my lungs still hurt from that red tide that fumes that uh I inhaled up the beach go ahead\nWe all have our issues here in Florida it's part of our lives you know or to what I Would like to say though is the last night I don't know if anyone mentioned but the lady that was on from the Democratic party [noise]\nUm I don't know if you noticed or not but when you were talking about someone being hurt or even killed she actually smiled I found that a bit frightening\nI miss that I got to go back and look at that I'm so focused on the show I'm not kind of looking at the er at the gas and the double boxer\nYeah I I'm very worried that someone's going to get hurt\nOr with how left in ... left wing and rabid and frenzy the left is becoming we're going to go back to the Eric Holder amen to remind you a little bit more of why Eric Holder was always a problem he's going to be running for president\nIt's holder if Booker it's perhaps Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren maybe all Bernie Sanders going to give it another world ah but I'm going to remind you of what kind of person\nIn the ... that Eric Holder is later on in the show for those of you who've forgotten remember he said yesterday when they go low we kick them basically\nIf Michelle Obama must love that let's go to Virginia and Calvin on line one I Love the name Calvin Calvin go have\nYes I see a ...\nA law that way in part of the state where I live um we don't live up in a bubble the DC area we live out in the ... or we're just so you\nCan't ... call back when you had a good line you're in a brutal line there\nBut I Love the commonwealth of Virginia Virginia changed demographically and it's changed politically and the connection is obvious guy\nOr immigration growing government presence it's changed Virginia but I think the good people or Virginia see what's happened with this economy they don't want to go backwards and anyone out there listening anyone you\nYeah and Calvin on line one I Love the name Calvin Calvin go have\nYes I see a red wave me\nA lot of ways in part of the state where I live\nUm we don't live up in a bubble of the DC area we live out in the ... or were destroyed though you\nCan't ... call back when I go to line you're in a brutal line there\nBut I Love the commonwealth of Virginia Virginia changed demographically and it changed politically and the connection is obvious guy or immigration growing government presence exchange Virginia but I think the good people or Virginia see what's happened with this economy they don't want to go backwards\nAnd anyone out there listening anyone you know in Virginia seventh district thinking you're thinking of of not voting or your complacent you got to get out there and vote in the seventh district of Virginia especially and of course Dave Brat as what I'm Talking about\nThe day brat races key he is a Trump guy he is a conservative he it's hard working he seeks to represent the interests of the citizens of the commonwealth of Virginia and he does a great job get out and vote\nEverybody has to get out and vote if you can already voted early vote early but get out and vote rounded Santas in Florida he adds up against this Gillum this horrible socialist guilt we lose Florida governorships going to be a bad deal so everybody's got to get out and vote\nThat he and he's getting millions and millions of dollars from a left wing billionaires Gillum even as the mayor of a ... of one of the few cities in Florida that was handled Enron really badly you want him nowhere near the governorship I can tell you that right now\nEight five five forty Laura or go to Mike in Arizona on line three Mike\nHow are you I'm great I was so crowded vehicle service and [noise] I Love my president I think it in a great job handling list I don't want him to cater to the Democrats have you go to what they're seeing and he should have been accused of of\nOf being wrong then if you could go on down there and paid work and it's a study showed leadership you did what he was supposed to have the ... or ... you were suffering because [noise] so I see a red wave in our area I don't know of any Democrats are going to be elected year I I just like\nMy own and but just like you got to hand it Tom leads you to the right thing on Kavanaugh I mean\nHe that would have been a real kick in the stomach of conservatives if he hadn't voted for Kevin ... so that's a good thing I'm going to look at the glass half full here because that's the only way you can go forward or the Federal Reserve though I trusted I was going to do a segment on this last night on the show and we we we were so jammed up we couldn't do it\nWe're going to do it tonight on the anger my ankle so tuned in ten pm eastern Fox News\nOr listening to independence ... eleven hundred ... a FedEx currently ranked in the top to buy raking Arizona listening to us worldwide eleven hundred Jay ...\nYou're listening to independence ... eleven hundred K. FX currently ranks and they're trapped by raking Arizona listening who was world wide eyed eleven hundred Jay affect our cards\nAnd Everytime you turn around right now are you seeing people look at the Democrats look at the comments by you know former attorney general holder and say that's disgusting that's not a party I Want to give power to and then they just get more desperate and I think this is going to go on for a while\nWell the the desperation comes in many forms Newt and now the criticism is for the moment of Donald Trump takes a couple of hours to to fly out to Pennsylvania to do a rally for all these people who are waiting\nAnd of course now as Donald Trump doesn't care about the victims\nYeah which is which is nonsense I mean it's very clear that the president and his entire team had been working very closely with the governors of Florida Alabama and Georgia and I think it an appropriate time the president will go down\nTo visit but as you know a head he tried to go down last night it would have been a nightmare because that would divert all Lugar all of the various workers away\nFrom what they should be doing to trying to take care of the president on street so\nHe'll get their president but I also want to see just whatever Donald Trump does he's gonna be attacked these people don't like him they wake up in the morning they say I Know what he's done something terrible what is it and that's kind of their approached everything right now and it makes them frankly a little bit nutty\nWell and I think that uh again the the theory and the frenzy ah has gotten to a point knew that when I was talking to folks now yesterday who are in Washington in the Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy or both assassinated\nAnd they were saying that they hadn't seen anything is is angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate\nI think I think basically you had extraordinary intensity up through\nWatergate you had a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point or you had soldiers are found that they couldn't go through airports are being harassed a and it was a very good or very divisive time\nAh but I think after that uh we became sort of more normal for a while and uh now we're drifting back a because this is a genuine\nIn the Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy or both assassinated\nAnd they were saying that they hadn't seen anything in this angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate yeah I think\nI think basically you had extraordinary intensity up through\nWatergate you had a we had a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point or you had soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports are being harassed or into is a very bitter very divisive time\nUh but I think after that uh we became sort of more normal for a while and uh now we're drifting back or because this is a genuine\nA cultural civil war I mean you know [noise] what Hillary Clinton said it wasn't in actors that shot somebody will but she's basically right or when we're point or somebody like a justice cabin out\nIt's because we want to return to a constitutionally based court system\nThat uses the American system is this model not some European or South African or other kinds of system and as a result if your a left wing a Democrat we we we are the end of your world ... you know they had hope desperately\nTo change America and now\nThe American people are responding and saying no we don't want to say we liked Being American and I think that has become just an enormously bitter blow\nFor the uh people who who thought\nUp into election night two thousand sixteen\nThey were ... Hillary Clinton was going to when they go at the two justices you've got and Hillary bin ... oh my God you know they they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution\nThat will really been a very dramatic difference compared to where we are now or I Want to\nPlay for you I'm Larry Sabato who of course famously bombed in his protections for twenty sixteen but nevertheless has this production for them in terms\nOf the air has ever been an abnormal presidency where he had that\nAnd the Trump is violated so many of the rules of politics in so many of the norms of politics a red wave ain't gonna happen it's just a question of how big the blue way it is they can be sued ami it could be a middle sized way they can be a small way it's going to be a blue wave\nOr what is your reaction thought\nWell maybe he's right with probably isn't I'm In the first question I asked is how come we just won a you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent a Hispanic\nAh and we won for the first time in a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation of how come a\nMix Sally the Republican nominee in Arizona's now heads or how come that er Kramer the Republican candidate in North Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points uh in his in ah\nTennessee as people to realize that brain is actually the Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get to a government run health system ... starting to fall apart mhm and Tennessee is going to end up protecting reprogram Germans getting a sense of\nYou know something out of self sabotage and say oh where's the where's the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nEight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent a Hispanic\nAh and we won for the first time on a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation of how come a\nMix Sally the Republican nominee and Arizona's now heads or how come the to Kramer the Republican candidate in North Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points uh in his in\nTennessee is people to realize that Britain is actually the Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get to a government run health system British and starting to fall apart mhm and Tennessee is going to end up with acting remotely I'm dumb as getting a sense of\nYou know ... and say oh where's the where's the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races in somebody's governors' races the one that I'm really watching is the Andrew Gillum\nVersus Ron I'm a dissent is because for me and for many of watch the growth of Florida and how well it's been\nA run by Rick Scott and and to the idea of turning that state over is critical that stayed in the country electoral politics\nTo a guy who is basically a socialist is just that just cannot happen and yeah he's getting millions and millions of dollars nude from all the usual suspects\nCharlie Chaplin I mean you'll um is um [noise] the latest great hope because you came out of nowhere as a radical Democrats uh he won an upset primary victory or ... temporarily looks very good\nI think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on but uh but when you say governorships remember but it was a study that just came out the ten most popular governors in states\nAre all Republican every single one of the ten highest rated governors or Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor of Maryland hardly a red state is gonna win it all and slut and the reasons exactly why uh we're building a majority in the country\nThey get results\nThey don't just have resistance are they actually have things that work they don't just have fantasies and strange ideas and I think we have to be prepared to wage a campaign\nThat drives home again and again and again the difference between a the kind of left wing fantasies that or not you can't afford them you can implement them a long run they're not going to work\nAnd I think that's one of our key jobs this campaign is to draw the distinction between results and resistance and certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of a resistance as the alternative\nYeah I I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turn out I think those images of the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control a I think that's I\nDon't think people like that they might not like everything Trump tweets or they might be annoyed at some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I what I get that but I think the frenzy people want it all to calm down they just want things to calm down they want to come down on both sides\nAnd I so I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this cabinet thing and I think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know fifty seat pickup\nAh so that's my\nImages of the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control a I think that's I\nThink people like that they might not like everything Trump tweets or\nThey might be annoyed at some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I what I get that but I think the frenzy people want it all to calm down they just want things to calm down they want to come down on both sides\nAnd I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this cabin on thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place\nIn a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know fifty seat pickup\nAh so that's my sense of it in holders comments Maxine Waters I don't know I think all of it is it gives people a bad feeling\n[noise] and I think you can draw the contract students here you have an economy which is booming at a level people said was impossible your jobs being created yoga lowest\nBlack on unemployment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history or you have a remarkable achievers would deregulation you have solid conservative judges being appointed so every time you turn around right now you're seeing genuine results\nAnd then you have as you point out uh people who seem crazed\nUh I mean is this really the America you want you really want people who come into a restaurant to harass people and drive them out when people banging on the Supreme Court doors are and I and I think in some cases of course we know the George stores and others actually pay for them uh which doesn't you know it doesn't do justice for him\nBut the whole system that the left has tried to create I think is in the end or not a sustainable system\nNewt I Know you're doing a lot of uh of events before the midterm uh elections and there's one on October fifteenth\nOr where you can register to um attend an evening with Newt Gingrich and you'll be able to hear you talk about what's in store for the country what's at stake for the country in the mid term so how do people end up ah attending this do they do and\nI'm Sorry I'm afraid I don't know that

... dot com and of course ah you know bills of books are among the best selling books of all time and literature and history a bill I Want to talk about what you see because you're one of the smartest political analysts out there\nWith all your experience reporting over decades\nOr what you're seeing play out now in the country is is worse\nThan um you expected and are we approaching perhaps a Nineteen sixty eight style a type of frenzy in the streets\nRather were bought out beyond that now I think it's the worst that I've seen in my forty five year journalism career yeah basically a nexus of or the media the corrupt media I'm now a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use the most\nRadical\nProgressive movement\nEver seen in this country ever in the history of the country so you have\nGuys like and everybody knows this named George Soros but others as well with unlimited amounts of money who basically um formed organizations to attack and destroy people with whom they disagreed\nNineteen sixty eight style a type of frenzy in the streets\nBut I think we bought or beyond that now I think it's the worst that I've seen in my forty five year journalism career yeah basically a nexus of ah the media the corrupt media I'm now a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use the most\nRadical progressive movement ever seen in this country ever in the history of the country so you have\nA guy's like and everybody knows this named George Soros but others as well with unlimited amounts of money who basically um formed organizations\nTo attack and destroy people with whom they disagreed this is why it's different than the Tea Party or the or a hypocrites on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to day will change their story depends on what they're told to do um\nYou have now a bevy of organizations and you saw it in a cabin or hearings that send people out these aren't mob people these are targeted\nPeople who are paid to do certain things you know to confront senators in elevators or with the CNN camera right behind them to ah prevent um Senator Cruz and his wife from having dinner these these aren't accidents are right to get Bill O'Reilly off the air\nNot an accident mhm okay so you have this and\nThe past journalism reporters would have investigated it because this huge money behind it but they don't now\nInstead they promote it\nThey're in business with the radical left in business with them CNN and MSNBC make money\nLots of it promoting the most radical progressive organizations in the country which will stop at nothing including violence\nTo get political power so that's what we're looking at\nDo you think that uh the president's handling of this ah that's our and the way he's addressed it has been held saw has it been\nIlluminating I don't think he knows what's going on\nThe way I just laid it out to you and your listeners\nI I just don't think he knows what's going on I don't think he knows the seriousness look whenever you have organizations that are in the shadows that people never heard of I'll give you one color of change our it and you've got twenty of them\nAnd they take their orders from big money to radical left people All right they say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted senator\nFlake in the elevator is paid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nBy George Soros funded foundations\nWas widely reported Laura you hear that\nMm no no no\nAnd so people think it's spontaneous oh this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's what's happening\nAnd you know I I draw the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany in the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties where you had a fanatical movement\nThey take their orders from big money to radical left people All right they say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted Senator Flake in the elevator is\nPaid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year by\nGeorge Soros funded foundations was widely reported Laura you hear that\nMm no no no\nOkay and so people think it's spontaneous oh this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's what's happening\nAnd you know I I draw the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany\nIn the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties where you had a fanatical movement Nazi ism\nAccumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods\nAre there and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested was engaged and the media in Germany uh basically we're afraid of the Nazis and they wouldn't tell the truth about them\nThat was more of a fear thing than a than a what we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress ones there cause in the media is the same cause that George Soros so it was a little bit more extreme than the editor to the New York times but not much\n[noise] so this big picture that's formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it um and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I Would order\nFBI investigation into the cabin or debacle\nBecause I Know and I think you do to that it was no accident Dianne Feinstein held back that letter from Dr Ford for six weeks that was not an accident\nIt was no accident it was leaked against Dr for its wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere\nBut let's say let's take it for face value that letter was leaked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked by somebody in Congress because only two people had the letter\nSo the FBI should be investigating that and should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they started that investigation which I Would order if I were president that scandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because that was no accident what happened a cabinet\nAnd the women were all the women are all lying by the way they were on line\nTwo and a couple of people are looking into this who actually knew or knew both of them now now you two of them\nIt was ... I went through this I went through this myself mhm right and and I saw things leveled against me that were insane\nAnd I you know at this point in this country people are going to have to want to make a decision right the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want\nThey can do exactly what they want and they almost got cabinet they almost got him and this is a kind of country what\n... is is it you're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things are not going to try to find the truth except it\nAccept it because it's been in play now for quite some time so who do you depend on to get the truth the only the apparatus is the criminal justice system and I'll put forth a President Trump should really see\nLeveled against me that were insane\nAnd I you know at this point in this country people are gonna have to want to make a decision by the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want\nThey can do exactly what they want and they almost got capital they almost got him and this is a kind of country what\n... is is it you're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except it\nExcept that because it's been ... been in Plano for quite some time so who do you depend on\nTo get the truth be only apparatus is the criminal justice system and I'll put forth a President Trump should really see a bigger picture he takes everything personally any fights back effectively himself but I don't know if you see in the big picture what's happening here\nYou know once you start to a road basic rights like presumption of innocence you process what'd you say they don't matter as the senator from Hawaii say don't matter\nDon't presumption of innocence at somebody accuses you of misconduct none you're guilty because in the past some women have been abused\nI mean think about it they're they're attacking the fundamental rights that Americans have un habitat and nothing what does what is being done nothing and I think bill you know I mean it's a division but I'm just so worried about it I Can't tell\nI Am ...

to defend ourselves and what the problem here is that the media has made us so crazy than most people are intimidated to defend themselves\nUnfortunately it's called Obama hypnotize the nation for eight years\nYes and look at that Eric Holder who he was always a piece of garbage he came out and said this is the new Democratic Party we kick he always was a thug here was the chief law enforcement officer America who almost had a mob burned down Ferguson, Missouri and now he's telling Americans get ready because we're gonna kick you\nRight there he's already telling somebody to go and commit a crime or kicking somebody believe it or not and Michael is aggravated harassment that has a misdemeanor he's already telling\nAll right look I don't know what's going on and I want to stop the man this before it gets worse I Want to stop the mass hysteria and I'm sending you a copy of the book God Bless you for being a surviving all those years in New York on the streets\nBut you know something my friend none of us are immune to what's coming Hillary holder at all want violence in this country\nTies the nation for eight years\nYes and look at that Eric Holder who he was always a piece of garbage he came out and said this is the new Democratic Party we kick he always was a thug here was the chief law enforcement officer America who almost had a mob burned down Ferguson, Missouri and now he's telling Americans get ready because we're going to kick you\nRight there he's already telling somebody to go and commit a crime kicking somebody believe it or like Michael is aggravated harassment that is a misdemeanor he's already telling\nMe All right look I don't know what's going on and I want to stop the man this before it gets worse I Want to stop the mass hysteria I'm sending you a copy of the book God Bless you for being a surviving all those years in New York on the streets\nBut you know something my friend none of us are immune to what's coming Hillary holder at all want violence in this country we should avoid it at all costs but if it comes to your doorstep what do you do when I returned\nLet's say pointing their finger at you and tapping pushing their finger against your clothing yeah I Wonder what could you do at that point\nYou can use enough force to stop and you cannot you can't damage and I'm In any significant way if\nThey want if the man is over sixty and the the attacker is twenty five years old you can tell me what enough forces\nWell he can use greater force the the older you get them the angry or the person is the more um cohorts around who\nMade oh great so old white guys now have the ability to defend themselves great\nOh yeah yeah I mean yeah yes\nNow what if you're in a car trying to retreat from them off\nAnd they chase you out of the restaurant you're getting your car they surround you and start beating on your car with sticks and they did in Oregon what can you do then\nI Believe that that's very close to a threat of deadly force because if they get you out of the car the same weapons that they use the same gang mentality that they use that can lead to either death or serious injury I think you can use lethal force in that situation\nAnd you know it would be no if I told you the anger motorcycle people\nYou were angry at a car pulled the car over banging on the windows and the driver pulled out a gun and shot a bunch of them everybody to do good you got the gang bangers you know you got the motorcycle gang here we have a ... a double standard because they've closed protesters\nWell are there any cases that you've tried in in this arena I mean that I that would be a lost her him of our question\nI had a case where a guy was being rude to somebody's life for the man knock knock guide on his butt\nVery close to a threat of deadly force because if they get you out of the car the same weapons that they use the same gang mentality that they use their going to lead to either death or serious injury I think you can use lethal force in that situation\nAnd you know there'll be no if I told you the anger motorcycle people you know we're angry at a car pulled the car over banging on the windows and the driver pulled out a gun and shot a bunch of them everybody would go good you got the gangbangers you know you got the motorcycle gang here we have a ... a double standard because they've closed protesters\nWell are there any cases that you tried in in this arena I mean that I that would be a loss of our question\nI had a case where a guy was being rude to somebody's life so the man knock knock guide on his butt\nAnd my client was and put on trial for knocking the bully on his butt and the jury acquitted 'em and later on one of them went up to me and said you know he was technically guilty but we didn't care the guy got what he does [laughter] that's that's the only one I've done\nSo I Know are you saying that a person can defend themselves effort if there is\nSelf they you know you you have to be calm when you do what you have to be professional you can't be acting at your own anger you know that's it if it's got to be in the realm of what any normal person would do which is what\nIf the guy as I say is over six the and the mob is people in their twenties and thirties ... there's no equal forced to that\nNo I think the people whose cars are seriously ... particularly the scene where the cars being pushed the guy is leaning against the trying to stop it in their swarming the car um that one and the one where the guy got out of the car in both those instances I think deadly force um was on the table\nBut we're not recommending deadly force on this radio show and I will I Will cautioned everyone listening to the following I'm a very smart woman said to me once do you want to know that person for the rest of your life you know there was do you want to be right and you want to be smart you can be rights and wind up in court for ten years\nOr you can be smart and and try to get away in any way you can I think that's what we're talking about here as well then isn't it\nWell I [noise] you know that in a fight even if you're a train martial artist you will sometimes lose so even if you are right and even if you think you can win if you can be safe and not have to hurt somebody that's better\nUm but at the same time I don't like the idea that you have to stand out and ... you know this is a whole history I mean I was reading stop mass hysteria\nAnd you're talking about the fifties and the communist attacks and the U.S against them and if you don't stand up to this type of fascism\nYou know whether it's Maxine Waters which is the person inside it at the beginning of the book or these groups on the streets masked mimicking terror groups or just the past what what's going to happen at some point people have to stand up\nAnd that's the that's the bottom line if we don't stand up we'll all fall down right\nNow there's no keep going they'll keep going until they take over every institution in the country as they almost have already done the universities are gone most police departments have been infiltrated and taken over by left wing fanatics as you know and cops who want to do the right thing are afraid to do the right thing\nFor example in Portland we saw a police officer sitting on his motorcycle doing nothing why do you think that was\nA I think he to me he looked angry I bet his superiors instructed him to stand down unless something actually erupted and I think he was just sitting there going this really stinks\nBecause the problem with that approach is that these attackers these rioters cut it anytime lose it and attack somebody or somebody getting out of their car or\nThat's the that's the bottom line if we don't stand up we'll all fall down right\nNow just don't keep going they'll keep going until they take over every institution in the country as they almost have already done the universities are gone most police departments have been infiltrated and taken over by left wing fanatics as you know and cops who want to do the right thing are afraid to do the right thing\nFor example in Portland we saw a police officer sitting on his motorcycle doing nothing why do you think that was\nA I think he can he look angry I bet his superiors instructor him stand down unless something actually arrested and I think he was just sitting there going this really stinks because the problem with that approach is that these attackers these rioters cut it anytime\nLose it and attack somebody or somebody getting out of their car or in their car can lose their temper and we'll be scared and then the violence has already happened and then the officers respond it's too late preemption is the key to preventing violence we know that\n... all day and watch the bottom line\nYou're let's note Dan how or when you're in a restaurant and you're actually a guy who's very fair minded in politically I think just somewhat liberal by the way which is your business or you know it's OK yeah you don't have to disguise yourself in any way I Know where you are in some ways\nI also know that I Know that you come from a family of of heroes that I Know for a fact that can I say anything about that or not\nYou can you can talk about I thought about that today how would my\nBoss so proud of his father who was in his nineties who fought his way from the beaches in Normandy to to um to um I think Berlin in World War two you also lost your uncle the new\nI yes he took himself out of a hospital bed to fight in the battle of the bulge and died\nSo damn comes from fighters Dan does night not like to retreat when people threatened him\nI've seen them in action and the courts so Dan I'm going to ask you a ... you're in a restaurant with me now okay I'm with you and they recognize me and I have my book out stop mass hysteria and we're reading from it and some waiter sees us doing it and he checked his friends to come in harass us\nThey come to the table and start yelling screaming what do we do\nI mean I thought about that because you were talking about that earlier and I was actually thinking of a particular restaurant where we were at where we worried about something like that happening I Would pick up a knife and disguise it in my hand and up because I'm not going to get hit sitting down\nAnd I would politely ask them to leave and if we had to I Would suggest we leave although going out on the street is dangerous I Would look to other people and in the restaurant to join in and protect us including\nThey won't know nobody will do that they'll look the other way I Know that for a fact\nOf late but if need be that nice kind of go where it needs to go to protect me I'm not going to take any physical violence from somebody who was attacking me ...\nWell now you know why that as my attorney\nAnd\nHe was an African he brings a napkin when I fight then brings in that into a knife fight\n[laughter] [laughter]\n[noise] all day and all I'm going to take a couple of calls because this is not a joke in question\nI have a number of people calling\nOn this

appreciate it feel the same towards your body hey I'm lots to talk about the Trump ... bus to the fed not helping us I don't blame the president for a feeling a bit of this thing or because you know the sad like anything that's bureaucratic it sees a\nPositive numbers and says wait a minute we need to get some of those shackles over here but at what expense right\n[noise] yeah no so you know the president is right I mean he he wants to continue that expansion is economic expansion that has really truly fully due to his pro growth policies tax cuts deregulation giving businesses more money to grow and expand\nMaking it easier to hire and ah you know ... dollars and you're overseas but you know I'll tell you this thing I think that that's going to do\nWhen we think things are getting a little too hot to kind of getting a little too overheated perhaps and we're going to raise interest rates a couple of you know a couple of percentage points because a part of a basis point I should say if we expect\nThat something will happen like let's say Democrats take over the house from real policies stop and there's an economic slowdown so we have to make sure that we have a little bit of caution to lower interest rates in case we get into a little bit of a of a mess when we have some of the socialist that perhaps get elected\nWell of course seems unfair for what they did it in the previous eight years I mean they do printed up a bunch of money\nHeld interest rates down to zero and ah you know they they basically gave a the Obama administration a lot of cover and now here we are uh you know counter mandating\nA you know the the holes that uh the Democrats dug for us and I don't mean while it's like some of the dirt coming back on us and look who's holding the shovel but the fed\nYou know it's funny what they're what they're doing right now are the opposite of what China is doing you know we're doing so well because of\nPresident Trump's policies that the fed is like hey we got to maybe have a little bit of a give ourselves a little bit of a cushion because we're doing so well you know what what China what they're trying to get\nSo when we have some of the socialist that perhaps get elected\nWell of course seems unfair for what they did it in the previous eight years I mean they do printed up a bunch of money held interest rates down to zero and ah you know they they basically gave the Obama administration a lot of cover and now here we are a ... you know counter mandating\nA you know the the holes that uh the Democrats dug for us and you know you don't mean well it's like some of the dirt coming back on us and a look who's holding the shovel but the fed well\nYou know it's funny what their act with what they're doing right now\nOr is the opposite of what China is doing you know we're doing so well because of President Trump's policies that the fed is like hey we have got to maybe have a little bit of a give ourselves a little bit of a cushion because we're doing so well ah you know what a what China with the Chinese government's doing now is actually lowering there is a requirement\nBecause they're not doing as hot as we are because we called them on their training and uh and frankly during the last eight years under Obama it's very very you know just print money very very easy to do quantitative easing\n[noise] send your emails room Dana saying free to Bill Bill Martinez live job\nWith you bill my thing is Chris Garcia is with us a\nCritic of course a has been a you know here's the c._e._o. of vicar financial a former senior Trump official as he was just sharing with us at the U.S Congress department\nYou know Chris I'm you know as you said the numbers are that the Obama administration used I you know the dangerous part of that is that if there is not an asterisk on those numbers are to really explain what they did and how they you know convoluted and and um you know kinda use some\nHocus pocus type of a metric system there people are going to get the wrong idea and they're going to think that uh you know or the Obama administration was much more effective than what we know\nWell that's exactly it and I encourage everybody to take a look at the article that my good friend um [noise]\nAh my very good friend Steve court has today you know about different in\nA really how the Obama administration measured their economic results and it's not even close you know everybody likes to talk about this is a\n[noise] you know you know if this trend that then President Trump is continuing the Obama trend line a but you know cap on economic advisors\nI knew what they did and how they you know convoluted and and um you know kind of use some hocus pocus type of a metric system there people are going to get the wrong idea and they're going to think that uh you know or the Obama administration was much more effective than what we know well\nThat's exactly it and I and I encourage everybody to take a look at the article that my good friend um [noise]\nAh my very good friend Steve Cortez and today you know about the difference in a really how the Obama administration measured their economic results and it's not even close you know everybody likes to talk about\nThis this uh [noise] you know a a\nYou know this this this trend that then President Trump is continuing the Obama trend line a but you know cast on economic advisors or you know chair I'm Kevin Hassett came out\nToday very robust press briefing couple of weeks ago with Sarah Sanders and showed how clearly there the inflection point we're in so many economic indicators after President Trump was\nSworn into office so you know and and in a press briefing room of course is completely quiet you know there were no questions because you can't refuse facts of course right now and so you know that's exactly what we've got to keep up we've got to keep up these were busted pro growth pro job [noise] pro business and frankly pro American or policies\nOf course you know speaking of asteroids that was the thing that every time there was a jobs report under Obama\nIn the next report did they always had or you know they always had an adjustment and never went up and always went down interestingly I'm On the converse you've got President Trump he's in office jobs and we had a job report that wow this is really awesome and then they go oh we have a revisions to the report and you think you know they're going to go down no goes up [laughter]\nYou know so this is the difference that clear difference between Democrats and Republicans and we can say compared comparing to CEOs that's the the chief ... executive or a executive office a bronco Obama versus a true CEO\nAnd Donald Trump he delivers on his promises and there are measurable results to your point I mean it's not some illusion every you know mathematical metrics it's just real basic you know how many jobs did we did it did we did we actually create or not how many jobs did it feel like you've created\n... that's exactly it and you know frankly a lot of people want to freak out about the\nKnow the economic a number you know stock market going down ... points yesterday but you're you know we're still up forty percent ... percent since President Trump\nWhether or not rated and so I I mean that is a tremendous tremendous achievement you know the Democrats said that he was gonna crash the market that it was going to be an of America as we knew it uh but now he's got a three percent GDP Growth target for the year\nThe Atlanta fed is predicting for point two percent GDP Growth just this upcoming for third quarter you know and as you said if you look back at the previous two quarters\nAnd the previous month and their revising these numbers these job numbers up for it so you know President Trump keeps on winning keeps on one and keeps on winning but I'll tell you one thing that we've got to make sure we guard against is the apathy because things are going so well we got to make sure we keep it going by getting Republicans\nIn control of the house and keeping them control the house or in the November\nWell we've been saying Chris that uh the president needs reinforcements\nAnd this is our opportunity to send people or to help this president out and also to reinforce to the electorate and uh you know and others are you know the Democrats certainly because the Democrats think that\nYou know it was some sort of anomaly there just something not right um you know whether we can blame the Russians or whoever that they can try to figure out who to blame\nFor the election of Donald Trump the bottom line is the bottom\nAnd as you said if you look back at the previous two quarters and the previous month and their revising these numbers these job numbers upwards so you know President Trump keeps on winning keeps on when he keeps on winning but I'll tell you one thing that we've got to make sure we guard against is apathy because things are going so well we got to make sure we keep it going by getting Republicans\nIn control of the house and keeping them control the house or the November\nWell we've been saying Chris that uh the president needs reinforcements and this is our opportunity to send people or to help this president out and also to reinforce to the electorate and uh you know and others are you know the Democrats certainly because the Democrats think that you\nKnow it was some sort of an anomaly there just something not right um you know whether we can blame the Russians or whoever that they can try to figure out who to blame for the election of Donald Trump the bottom line is the bottom line you know the American people were tired of mediocrity just like they were tired of mediocrity under Jimmy Carter\nSaid we've got to have something different and Donald Trump has been the man of the hour thank God and it's really save this country and as you said earlier why would you fire somebody who is delivering on their promises and getting these kind of results you know to your point earlier Brock Obama\nAnd all his brain crush said Bob the best America can hope for was to present GDP\nYou know what was Donald Trump gonna come in and wave some sort of wand and suddenly see us going to three to five percent you know what does that nickel and talk what does he know [laughter] well it's like the person a budding and he would like to say we're in for point to a good shot possibly very shortly we could be at over five percent\nAnd this is with no help from the Democrats who've done everything they could resist to do to resist and or the other thing of course is the fed the fed not helping the program either\n[laughter] yeah no I mean I'll tell you it's exactly right you know you can't dispute the fact you know and and one of the things that I think you could ask every American honestly is you know are you better off or worse off\nUnder President Trump name one way that you are worse off under President Trump and all it for all intents and purposes you know unless you're a Democrat in Congress or your life and it could just significantly better under President Trump and one thing that you know for any for me personally and for\nMy uh are capable of Hispanic annual wage growth is it three point seven percent under President Trump's leadership and actually the pace of the national average so as I said are prospering\nHispanic Americans are prospering African American unemployment and spank unemployment of all time lows veterans are prospering woman are prospering everybody's price round as president and a and frankly that is what we need to keep up and keep\nGoing directly cited dynamic side you first spreading the good news about it the thing that\nAbsolutely well Chris uh you know we're all part of the solution here and I'm excited to your point about a Hispanic small business grows I mean it is exciting and uh the Hispanic people get it they're not a monolithic group as the Democrats would want people to believe\nMay not a you know tell everybody or or answer a pollster and in saying one way or another because they know the divide in this country and most people are just going to go ... leads to the voting booth\nAnd they're going to vote their wallets and they're going to vote success and they're going to vote to continue to when I really believe that and this whole idea of a blue wave I think is delusional\nYeah no and that's exactly it we've got to make sure we guard against the apathy we knew we can't being pretty license no we just\nSaw in the Supreme Court hearings is it is a taste of what will happen with Democrats in control of the house just remember that image\nExactly and Chris here we are you know the president has done\nSuch a great job and bring in Canada and Mexico to the table we got rid of NAFTA we now have the U. S. M. C. A. Everytime I say that I I I picture of the ...\nUh you know tell everybody or or answer a pollster and in saying one way or another because they know the divide in this country and most people are just going to go silent leads to the voting booth and they're going to vote their wallets and they're going to vote success and they're going to vote to continue to when I really believe that\nAnd this whole idea of a blue wave but I think is delusional\nNo and that's exactly it we've got to make sure we guard against the apathy we can't being pretty license no we just\nSaw in the Supreme Court hearings is it is a taste of what will happen with Democrats in control of the house just remember that image\nExactly and Chris here we are you know the president has done such a great job and bring in Canada and Mexico to the table we got rid of NAFTA we now have the U.S MCA Everytime I say that I I I picture of the village people dancing across the screen for something [laughter] you know the fact that matter is that this is win win for Mexico\nFor America and for Canada and this is the initial phase of leveling out the trade playing field that makes it fair for everybody especially Americans because\nOnce we get this you know approved\nBy Congress which is their job to do and then we were able to go in and negotiate things and settle everything down with our European partners\nAnd then uh it really puts an ordinance pressure on China even though China's already said is you know hey look we want to negotiate willing and and the president goes a ... it's not the right time yet I mean there are feeling a lot of pain and so they're getting Nancy but he knows that he's got them on the hook\nAnd he's just dragging them along until it's just the right time for them to negotiate and for America to leverage\nA you know and take advantage of the ... that is at hand for them or don't you think\nYou know and that's exactly what a smart move that President Trump is is taking he is really taking the step of\nAny approach really of of allowing the Chinese to have enough rope to hold and so hang themselves and and when you think about how much of an impact these terrorists\nAre in this trade war is having on a Chinese with respect to the U.S economy in the U.S consumer base we really haven't felt the tariffs that they try to get back on us and so if we continue to drag without draw this out until they actually are willing to make concessions like stopping the theft of our intellectual property\nExactly like like stopping a force technology transfer a you know China's an entire are indeed apartment basically is just IP theft or you know so as soon as we get them to make those concessions acting president Trump's going to strike a deal but you're right\nHe wants to drag without slow walk slow I get this deal done ... assigned it ratified by Congress the U.S some CEO\nApproach to you a striking new deal with them get\n... get Japan are already got the Korea deal with South Korea deal done and then we are and then we join our allies in any unified fashion against China and I think that really\nTurned up the pressure on them and bring them back to the table where they have no choice but to but to play fair\nWell perfectly laid out Chris currency and thank you so much Chris and former senior Trump official at the U.S Commerce Department or Chris again as always we appreciate the inside and thanks for coming on the show\nPressure on them and bring them back to the table where they have no choice but to play fair\nWell perfectly laid out Chris Garcia thank you so much Chris a former senior Trump official at the U.S Commerce Department or Chris again as always we appreciate the inside and thanks for coming on the show\nWith um Mexico and Canada and um and we'll get a treaty there although I ... I like the U. M. C. A. I mean it almost sounds like something with a village people or something that's right and the\nVillains people instead of mess right now yeah exactly or it's going to be quite a process to ratify it next year is not going to be easy but hopefully that'll happen\nUm we're still talking to the European Union and potentially having terrorists going back in there but the big ones obviously China yeah and ah we've got currently two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of goods what we have tariffs on coming from China\nAnd they've got about a hundred and ten billion dollars in us good going there they've got tariffs on\nWill probably by the end of the year going full boat and everything coming in from China which is over five hundred billion and that's clearly slowing the economy as well it means that Americans pay higher prices for everything that's got passed on it which is hot and that means American goods are going to cost more to China somewhat slowing\nEconomic growth with the two largest countries in the world and unless either side gives them a I think that's just going to be like a long term trade war and I I may be wrong but I don't see inside giving in right now but\nWell it it seems to me well I heard that uh there were some lynching coming down the way from China and President Trump said not right now he was going to let them feel more pain because I think that he wants to get you\nKnow our European partners squared away get that balanced out because you and I discuss before you got you got Canada you got Mexico now squared away you get our European allies squared away um which is you know that's a huge issue unto itself and then at that point it really kind of puts a stranglehold\nA bit on China to where you know they don't have a lot of room to move here\nAnd they've been hurt I mean there's no national that's been paying but more pain\nIn China than here their their stock market's down twenty twenty five percent this year was already spent up um and there are major much more of an export oriented economy than than we are and so we are definitely implying you know a lot of pain on them right um and hopefully they will\nUh you know concede and lower tariffs and stopped doing the things we object to like stealing our technology\nAh but they've got to admit that I'm doing it wrong and they haven't done that so far so we'll have to say but if that continues that's also a negative for economic growth going forward\nWell but going forward we at that squared away my goodness what happens is the stock market we got\nWell if we do that would be fantastic that would be very very bullish\nRecord numbers really I don't that's that meanwhile be smart I mean now the bond market is something\nTo where you know they don't have a lot of room to move here\nAnd there but her I mean most Schmidt's been paying but more pain\nIn China than here their their stock market down twenty twenty five percent of the fear was already spent up um and there are major much more of an export oriented economy than than we are and so we are definitely implying you know a lot of pain ... on them right um and hopefully they will\nUh you know concede and lower tariffs and stop doing the things we object to like stealing our technology but they've got to admit they're doing it wrong and they haven't done that so far so we'll have to say but if that continues that's also a negative for economic growth going forward\nWell but going forward and we had that scored away my goodness so what happens is the stock market we got well if we do that would be fantastic that would be very very bullish record numbers really mean we really are nuts but meanwhile be smart I mean ah the bond market is something to take a real good look at and also uh\nThe

Dr Ford should have the opportunity to testify but here's what I feel very simply this was just like a knee jerk reaction of just giving it to the audience ears host\nNo matter what she says this is so nebulous this is so distant and she's even had questionable recollection of times and dates in locations\nAnd now the judge the judge in my mind has so many people coming to the forefront saying that you know he wasn't there were\nThis whole thing was not true and so many women I think sixty five women have even written testimonials on on behalf of the judge it's totally insane but let me get Gary Webb and here he of course there's much to say and welcome Garry to the show you a question are coming to you\nKnow I I think this is just another dominant a collapse of the Democratic process I I think we're seeing an erosion of every institution in our national government I'm In this this this weird shot I think this is probably a political his job\nAnd it made me money behind it I mean you know we can't prove that we gotta get respected doctor for a here we are on eleventh and a half hour as you pointed out and we're we're we're facing these kind of accusations like you said they're very nebulous vague and thirty six years ago\nAnd the statute of limitation is long expired and I'm happy I not going to do an investigation I don't know any law enforcement agency on a state level would take that up now so it's just he said she said that's what it is\nIt's terrible guys and you know what let's let's have some of the callers jumping sorry to be disrespectful there John So I just wanted to say let's go to line number one but high women is on the line here obviously good morning what what's your question or comment regarding the situation and our ...\nI'm In this this this weird shot I think this is probably a political his job\nAnd it made me money behind it I mean that you know we can't prove that we gotta get respected doctor forward but here we are in eleventh and a half hour as you pointed out and we're we're we're facing these kind of accusations like you said they're very nebulous vague in thirty six years ago\nAnd the statute of limitation is a long expired and I'm happy I not going to do an investigation I don't know any law enforcement agency on a state level would take that up now so it's just he said she said that's what it is\nIt's terrible guys and you know what let's let's have some of the callers jumping sorry to be disrespectful there John So I just want to see let's go to line number one the high women is on the line here obviously good morning what what's your question or comment regarding the situation and are getting\nYou for taking my call you but go ahead I'm Wondering why this accuser of judge Kavanaugh her background as in the midst of gated good point\nHer um three years of high school sophomore senior or junior and senior years I've been scrubbed from the Internet that you're\nVery interesting you live what would you say this is interesting we get very intelligent callers on the show would you would imagine\nI'm ... I mean I you know there are indications that the ... are on the left ... but I I don't think there's much to be gained in and attacking her or propagating some sort of conspiracy theories about her as opposed to Dianne Feinstein senator Feinstein's or just\nOn defensible a action and bring on that's only raising it after all the hearings are done as well as a lawyer that that doctor board hired ever have the uh\nA long time or a democratic or left wing activist and so I think\nShe and Feinstein really to blame for a lot of the the circus like a atmosphere here I I don't think there's there's much to be gained from from going after doc reporters I'll\nMake it really looks go to line number two cw in Arizona your question or comment a very politically charged subject we all have to wait and see right she W what's gonna happen Thursday what's your question or government\nWill appreciate getting on your show Steve this is the first time among calling a new show I don't typically call them on the road on business in Arizona and I heard you on the radio and I just couldn't hold back I just had to call and\nMy one in the news is I've not heard anyone state whatsoever in regards to a friend's dying somewhere to their little this letter or supposedly that she has that miraculously show up at the eleven or so our\nAh it has never been presented my question is what in regards is taking place and why is it not been stated anything about a ... century fact there were a force her to give the letter although the ex are so weak backed factors\nAnd what is the situation where no one has even spoke about\nLooking into the actual letter itself where is the letter doesn't even exist or is this another ploy\nPowerful cw powerful stuff you're asking here on the interest of the time here thank you first of all sir thank you for calling the show and I hope you become a regular and I do appreciate that but he only on your most important in the response here because we want to hear what you say to see them\nAnd then I'll I'll I'll unfortunately have to go after this response I sure it is unusual I think another ah indictment of of Senator Feinstein that she has not made this letter a public uh I don't know if anyone can can prove her to do so I propose Kevin and Grassley could could issue us up to eight hour asked\nA doctor for that are hearing what you could buy a but we have\n... are so weak backed factors and what is the situation where no one has even spoke about looking into the actual letter itself where is the letter doesn't even exist or is this another ploy\nPowerful seeing these powerful stuff you're asking here on the interest of the time here thank you first of all sir thank you for calling the show and I hope you become a regular and I do appreciate that but he only on your most important in their response here because we want to hear what you say to see them\nAnd then I'll I'll I'll unfortunately have to go after this response I sure it is unusual I think that there are indictment of Senator Feinstein that she has not made this letter or public uh I don't know if anyone can can prefer to do though I propose Kevin Grassley could put issue us up eight hour as\nA doctor for that are hearing what you could buy a but we have not seen the letter we see an actor and I think ah it would really help the process at least a poll letter we'll see if that happens in the next day it is\nNearly as you'll be real senior fellow in constitutional studies ... Supreme Court review going to be calling on you again and I hope that that would be your wish to come back I Hope you do do that and I do appreciate your time sort of like you so much for having me by now go to line number one mark in Nevada though you'll use not on the line and your comment to the subject matter today\nYeah three things to think about on this situation one Grassley has no claws first of all is here to\nGo ahead where we think we lost him\nOkay we're going once twice three times I'm Sorry mark we lost you mark usually has some really interesting commentary but you heard what he said let's now go briefly the line number to Francis in doing a good morning you're on your comment we've got about a minute and a half and thank you for joining us\nWell is it just kind of okay now I can hear you better\nMhm that's go ahead please thank\nYour diet interference from that other line but you know let's look at this whole thing here's somebody that\nSays that she was a girl when she was Fifteen he was Seventeen and she didn't tell anybody she didn't tell the parents nothing I Know this was a set of circumstances\nAnd it is so this whole thing is selling thing it even if it was true and he was Seventeen and she was Fifteen it would be a stupid thing but that's about it\nAnd here we have a life that it has everybody respected him in every phase of his life including the kids he went to high school where\nAnd everybody's believing this woman who I Know has been an activist against anything conservative a whole life\nFrancis is amazing I Wish we had more time you're spot on and again we all do crazy things in high school but I Know I never did what the allegations that the doctor for just making against judge Kavanaugh and I'm sure you didn't and vice versa but\nShe should at least have our ability to to speak but look how this is throwing the monkey wrench into this entire process thank you for instance for your time let's reconnect here with mark in Nevada and mark it must be a solar flare or something going on up there but you have only about a minute or so\nThey go ahead mark\nI'm Sorry it looks like Mark you're on a cell phone on an airliner you hear me yes go ahead you're less than a minute and I'll go ahead\nAnd you hear me just go ahead\nOh shades number one ran for you has no than to go forward it to wait any Cindy writing a committee to if I have to get the five boroughs mock we caught up with\nUnfortunately we're going to have to dump the call here we're losing you on a cell phone but I think what you're saying is\nFirst a but she should at least have our ability to to speak but look how this is throwing the monkey wrench into this entire process thank you for answers for your time let's reconnect here with mark in Nevada market must be a solar flare or something going on up there but you have only about a minute or so\nThey go ahead mark\nI'm Sorry it looks like Mark you're on a cell phone ... hey army yes go ahead you're less than a minute and I'll go out and you hear me just go ahead\nOh shades number one Grassley has no than to go forward it to be anything they committed to the ethics mark hey we caught up with\nMark unfortunately we're going to have to dump the call here we're losing you on a cell phone but I think you're what you're saying is that Senator Grassley has no testicular fortitude to be able to hold a here hold these hearings and stand tall with the rule of law\nIt's hard to keep up with all of them well in Nineteen Eighteen the version that broke out on the Boston waterfront in a naval facility in the early part of September was the most virulent strain we've ever seen on the planet\nIt was so effective at what it did which was attack your immune system cause your immune system to create white blood cells which is what we always do we have an infection sure but ah unlike most blues which kill young people and the elderly\nOr this one kill people in the prime of their life because they put their immune system on such a case of\nOverdrive that it literally filled their lungs with white blood cells oh ...\nOh that's horrible and you describe in the interests of time here and again this was a prolific story and again to focus going from the Supreme Court to boggle to this I thought it so important and I love those and I'm sure Iranians does to talk about a hundred years ago in America the seeds that you said it's almost like when you read the smoke was dumb and believe me this was a really powerful book\nAnd get this is awesome I Hope that you have a second and third version of these type of stories because he puts his back into like you're going down the streets in Boston but here's my question or comment really\nThis disease you described soldiers would get it and I was in ... would they die this is theoretically has written a book am I correct within hours people would go from infectious to then death that's horrible\nI'm like oh yeah it it it was that's why it killed so many people around the world because it moved so quickly um they were many many cases\nAre not just in Boston but then as the disease spread across the country of people being fine at breakfast edited by dinner\nTerrible I mean ... it's a clarion call for everybody listening to the show\nImportant and I love those and I'm sure our audience does to talk about a hundred years ago in America the stage that you said it's almost like when you read this book was done 'em and believe me this was a really powerful book\nAnd skip this is awesome I Hope you have a second and third version of these type of stories because it puts his back into like you remember walking down the streets in Boston but here's my question or comment really\nThis disease you described soldiers would get it and not within ... would they die this is theoretically has written a book in my current within hours people would go from infectious to death that horrible oh my God yeah\nIt it it was that's why it killed so many people around the world because it moved so quickly um they were many many cases\nAre not just in Boston but then as you spread across the country of people being fine at breakfast and dinner\nThat's terrible I mean and and so it's a clarion call for everybody listening to the show\nThat we hear about Ebola and the horrible diseases like that that are somewhere on the coast of Africa and thank God you know powers to be or what have you I mean we could go on conspiracy but I won't say whether manufactured viruses are causing the bill delineation a global populations as a whole nother crazy story and it's all about what you write\nHis historical fact and described to us we we've got about four or five minutes and I want to hear this go back to Boston at that time this was a time when America president Wilson of course promised walk throughout the spirit before that he would never engages in a foreign war\nAnd things dramatically changed so the nation like today even though we're high tech and you're involved in high tech take us down to some of the other things that were going on concurrently around this disease in Boston you have some actual positive stories there was a World Series going onto\nAnother layer of a number of great uplifting stories at the time at every aspect of American Life in this particular month was dominated by the war and the war effort or the ... the world series has played in September as opposed to October was because the government\nDecided that every man between the ages of Eighteen and thirty had to either enlist make themselves eligible for the draft or have a job\nThat supported the ... and it's not just any job right but a specific job that was about supporting Americans effort\nA and you're right Wilson had been reelected on this on this slogan of he kept us out of war and suddenly it had to turn around\nPublic opinion in this country to go from\nElecting him to keep us out or to being a hundred percent existential e behind the war effort\nAnd it got to just jump in here and tell me from history I don't know this I think I should Barris the cause of World War one was it because of an assassination attempt on someone and then everything went to hell in\nThe war the war was three years old and had been raging in Europe for three years by the time America he joined the effort for three years old four and a half years old by the time of September Nineteen Eighteen rolled around well um because it took America up\nA lot of time\nTo gear up when we declare war in Nineteen Seventy we had no standing army we had you know we didn't have enough bullets we didn't have enough guns we didn't have enough ships and so it took us a while to get up to a war footing which is why Wilson work so hard to make sure that every man woman and child in America was doing their part\nAnd you know it's amazing from your book I guess the overt patriotism that was in America\nThat people literally one they signed up in droves and this is not a misrepresentation I'm it's just tell me if I'm wrong but when I'm reading in your book is that a Labor Day parade there was a powerful patriotic or presidents and now today there's a lot of divisive Mr aren't patriots obviously we we do a show that appeals to that side of the equation at least we hope so\nBut in that time in my right skip that there seem to be more like it\nTemer Nineteen Eighteen rolled around well um because it took America up a lot of time to Europe when we declare war in Nineteen Seventy we had no standing army\nWe had you know we didn't have enough we didn't have enough guns we didn't have enough ships and so it took us a while to get up to a war footing which is why Wilson work so hard to make sure that every man woman and child in America was doing their part\nTennis and you know what's amazing from your book I get the overt patriotism that was in America\nThat people literally what they signed up in droves and this is not misrepresentation I'm it's just tell me if I'm wrong but what I'm reading in your book is that a Labor Day parade there was a powerful patriotic or presidents and now today there's a lot of divisive Mr are patriots obviously we we do a show that appeals to that side of the equation at least we hope so\nBut in that time in my right skip that there seem to be more like if they wanted to go to war and nobody wanted it but if we were told to go to war\nThere was a whole different attitude in the country about if they weren't as many protesters we were more aligned in the spirit of togetherness am I correct in that is\nYeah I I think well if there were plenty of protest you know there are hundreds of bombings every year in the United states in the late Nineteen ten um we forget that part about history as well but you're right a everything about our conduct or what's different even down to\nUh the way we paid for\nWe literally borrow the money from the American people in the form of stamps and on that people bought to pay for the war while as opposed to today where we kind of hide it on a a a line in a budget somewhere and both sides of the aisle pretend it's not really there\nYou know it's coming up on that gives you know what the broadcast world here but I Want I Want to do is this is fascinating and I'd like to continue this conversation about this wonderful book of course but also I Hope that the folks here including our producer failed to remind me which I don't normally need a reminder\nYou're involved with the Google and of course I'm going to go into the question with you and I think rightfully so of what I'm hearing here are\nJust ... I guess uh when he resigned from Google we was talking I guess about the uh the whole story about to enter debts but in China they're going along with supposedly the suppression of the Internet and how to prevent people from seeing things and obviously this Internet the comeback ladies and gentlemen very special guest here we go to ... them often with great guess ringer e history as a brand\nNew

qualified workers now is we do a lot of company to do the same thing or the big market and a lot of people say we do person I talked to an all they do is it so first of all what his personality\nOr what his personality and the brief description there's there's three jerk or is the patterns of thoughts feelings ... years\n[noise] so we use those red for each one of those are the buck than what we are very powerful they can use our record but he's also with us in our process supervised she mentioned that people are structure things like a credit record a device ... pleased with uh recently read and introduced a\nCritical to report the people that tradition or be the best thing\nThat it was fabulous report one versus the four I Love this report it needs to Minnesota and realized before I Wish I Would add this many years ago were it'd be a better manage [noise] so I saw when you go to doing that's what you're passionate about what motivates you that's what drives you why is that important it's really important I understand that\nOr what his personality and the brief description is there's three characteristics patterns of thoughts feelings and behaviors\nBay so we use instruments for each one of those from the boss and why we have a very powerful they can use our record ... how you process information they mentioned the people as structure things like that incredibly accurate a device ... pleased with it recently we introduced a\nCritical thinking you report and people that took it and are able to testing said it was and then in this report one person said why I Love this report it gave me some insight I hadn't realized before I Wish I had this many years ago were raped me a better manage [noise] so that's thoughts when you go to\nDealing that's what you're passionate about what motivates you that's what drives you why is that important it's really important understand that because it affects the Haitian effects where you put them that's how that relates to your

people we are all different all behave differently and how you react somebody else will impact things like communication and stuff like that\nHere here's something really interesting that you know I think we've all taken different personality tests behavioral things like that we've all taken\nEach data and you love data not just data Star Trek gate of data numbers data this is all you're sort of thing are loaded and both equally so here's what we've got\nVia tech global they worked with human resources department through the selection process the training process everything it take to get the right people into the right position in the right companies and keep them there\nWe talked before the break about increasing productivity even one percent which doesn't sound like a lot but for a company that's doing a million dollars a year\nThat ten thousand dollars so if you do in a million dollars a year ten thousand dollars but it's more than that because each little bit of increase in productivity means\nThat you increase something out and then those increases mean more increases in productivity and Michael you you were talking to us or during the break a about all the different increase it and the things that that by attack global jot a starting with the testing\nAnd going on so talk to us a little bit about that\nOkay well there's so many facts let me talk about one thing that is diagnosing the girl again it goes back to the theater you look at what we do you make you look at the region you need balance all elements that you were and then you get in\nThere's a year ten thousand dollars so if you do in a million dollars a year ten thousand dollars but it's more than that because each little bit of increase in productivity means that\nYou've increased something out and then those increases mean more increases in productivity and Michael you you were talking to us or during the break a about all the different increase it and the things that that by attack global John\nAh starting with the testing and going on so talk to us a little bit about that\nOkay well there's so many facets of that let me talk about one thing that that we found it very very important that is diagnosing the problems\nAgain it goes back to the data that you look at what we do if you look at the make up if you look at the ingredients you needed a team you need balance sheet all elements that teams make it work well and if it's not that one then you get into a group thinker you get into space mission can ever get to a result of times they can sometimes a cat\nBut once we go through a diagnostic we can actually look at it very closely to figure out what the problems are\nWe did that with a with a team of the you know we understood very quickly where the issues were prescribe it solution and get them back on track\nIt's like understanding where the problem is that particular case ... leadership\nOne of the girls was the only problem was they were all centered in one area that you'd think something to death but they couldn't make it happen why they had gas in their team that people that didn't focus on their folks on something else wasn't producing the results what'd you understand that\nAnd then you approach it from a ... perspective from election per se but they're in a different person in that particular slots once you do that any work on the communication work on the collaboration you transform a the big time and you start with let's diagnose the problem the laundry diagnosis that we could figure out what sort of\nAn elderly here's a question because um [noise] you you you were talking about having the person basically adapt to the situation through training or get a different person in there is there ever a time where the situation down to the person\nIs what I mean what a great observation because it happens and that's even that's in some ways an even bigger because when we do some training and were folding because we've got a dysfunctional will actually look at the diagnostics you will see how somebody is naturally\nAnd how they're moving up into the area where everybody else\nBecause that's the pressure because they don't have the openness to realize that this person they're different but this person as something to the gym but we don't have and we need to nurture that as opposed to getting them try to think what we think ... and that's where you come in is understand it's not that there are different and that's bad it's different and that's good\nTo be capturing I'm different then it's good you are different and it's weird [laughter] there was that the the difference you know I don't think they're depressed for that he had no ... well there is but it's I don't think it's the one that Michael that's\nActually [laughter] [noise] money you should ask how do you should ask you I mean you should ask\nSo last question because we've been talking about bigger sized businesses last question you've got a family business\nI'm the person at the top is not leaving a how\nYou know what do you do for that in the you know ... is there anything to do for that do you do you give them a personality test and work around that can you\nThere are a great question we have a distributor in Santa Fe does that focuses on family businesses are these are typically high high net worth people that are having people in to help them figure out what to do with their money so it's a very small team\nAnd she does all of the the assessments of incoming people and she does the training and she does all of a sudden she runs into this problem all the time and the best way to adjust\nActually [laughter] [noise] funny you should ask how did you should ask you I mean you should ask\nSo last question 'cause we've been talking about bigger sized businesses last question you've got a family business\nI'm the person at the top is not leaving a how you know what do you do for that and they you know ... is there anything to do for that do you do you give them a personality test and work around that can you\nKnow there are a great question we had a distributor and set up that focuses on family business and these are typically high high net worth people that are having people and to help them figure out what to do with their money so it's a very small team\nAnd she does all of the the assessment of incoming people and she does the training and she does all of a sudden she runs into this problem all the time and the best way to address the problem if they're open to it is once you understand what that's coming from\nAnd once you understand how that interaction is you know once you understand then you can do with the proactively or not\nIf you deal with it if you decided not to deal with it and that's a different problem most people once they see this and they see the results and they see how they're contributing to it you have a transformation and that's usually what happens when you have a very strong leader that person can be just for the call\nAnd once they understand that understand where the strengths are limitations are who are met those limitations in their team start using them you have a whole different thing I can say that from the from first hand it 'cause I discovered that about myself and it's just transformational it turns or forty random him into an absolute\nIdle you will so it's about understanding it's about being open open with with yourself and your team to figure out how to make that work better quite often when you have a really really strong leader didn't want to go anywhere they sometimes evoking steer environment and they probably don't even realize\nThings can change and you know and you can expand on a person's greatness while minimizing the folks that we all have so\nWe've been speaking with Michael ...\nVia tech global via tech global dot com and read sized isn't it should be evaluating their people before during and ah you know it's certainly before and certainly during the 'cause you wanna get great people and you want to keep great people\nSo ... and let let's not forget also if you are one man's shop or one woman shop it'll also help you relate to your clients is better absolutely you'll keep can retain your clients\nAn absolutely that is so true\nAbsolutely and even even nonprofit everybody everybody should be doing as\nWell as we said at the top of the show this is the new format today so we did promise that we're going to have our\nOur listeners give us challenges that we're having and we're going to respond to them and instead of having a business come in and talk about their challenge in the hot seat here we're going to take questions from the Internet Facebook email wherever our listeners want to send us

Monday\nWhat can you give your your employees and and the other businesses are unwilling to do\nWhen I hear absolutely [noise]\nThe baby chatter going on right now is one of the problems that you have with today's environment is the actual environments actual culture at what company what employees are looking for what you were looking for is transparency\nHonestly being heard being part of it understanding your mission and understanding how the country\nThat all goes to their engagement all goes to their happiness to provide that where they're really something to look for a company to work

retirement expense ideas first you know if you break it down I'm too in general terms you can break it down to like three categories and you know what you will need in retirement\nBut say in a smart way you know for twenty year old right now of projecting out if they wanted to say maybe to get you let's see eight sixty five\nAnd get a I'm Sorry [noise] ah my numbers I took it to eight sixty seven a twenty year old date sixty seven wants to generate seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars set aside if they can earn six percent of their money they have to set aside two hundred and thirty nine dollars a month\nA fear fear a fifty fifty year old that number ... number becomes a little bit over two thousand dollars a month or two hundred a month for a twenty year old or two thousand a month for a fifty year old earning six percent will generate seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars by age sixty seven\nBut the thing is don't get bogged down on my numbers you want to save as much as possible coupons saving so the early years maybe less responsibility the ability to save\nActing out if they wanted to say maybe to get you let's see eight sixty five\nAnd get a I'm Sorry my numbers I took it eight sixty seven a twenty year old date sixty seven wants to generate seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars set aside if they can earn six percent of their money they have to set aside two hundred and thirty nine dollars a month\nA fear fear a fifty fifty year old a number number becomes a little bit over two thousand dollars a month or two hundred a month for a twenty year old or two thousand a month for a fifty year old earning six percent will generate seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars by age sixty seven\nBut the thing is don't get bogged down on among numbers you want to save as much as possible coupons saving\nSo the early years maybe less responsibility the ability to save and the ability to save his high then you get in like the ... years the mid working years there's more challenges you know perhaps ah children polls on different of ah Arab avenues from your finances\nYou know maybe you're a you know against children\nYou know that's taking care of them may be looking at maybe do I save some for college for them now to juggle between savings for college and from our retirement you know what should I be doing\nWith the main thing is maintaining your savings maintaining it may be trying to increase it to write perhaps maybe you're getting a raise or increasing your income you know try to earmark that some additional for saving through their retirement plan\nAnd then also may be outside of their retirement plan to mean that goes even for the younger people to build up those non retirement money too\nAnd then it can be used for retirement but they could also be used for a additional savings\nOr emergency reserves but also maybe you know maybe five years from now you're looking to put some money down on a new house or something so again he made years of my life more challenges but again still want to continue to save and save\nLet's say you get paid fifty between age Fifteen fifty five now you really start to focus in on your savings\nOr maybe some expenses I mean maybe being cut down or maybe they're gone back up maybe you know you've got college costs now\nBut uh again you start to look at continuing to save and save a lot of people in this position looking realize maybe they need to bump up their contributions taken advantage of the employer match is maybe the raw provisions et cetera\nAlso very opportune time to start looking at the positioning of your money for retirement\nYou know not just how you allocate just\nYou know it was a stocks bonds cash but how your position and the money for retirement income in the future and this goes as you reach eight fifty five and older\nAnd keep on save as much as possible and save save save and also positioning for income for life right you want to have that income

G. radio dot com and again my telephone number is ... free one eight seven seven three one seven seven six three zero one eight seven seven three one seven seven six three zero\nSo we talked about retirement expenses retirement savings\nNow how about uh the question\nHow do you know when you're ready to retire how do you know when you are ready to retire I think the you can break it down and then you know look at two areas here and they need to be looked at you know both together but separately\nThe financial side but the non financial side maybe the emotional side financial side it becomes down to plan right plan plan plan and that's what I'm here for a plan before you invest plant smart to retire smart\nAnd plan for that income for life you know looking at the positioning of your money to generate that income\nIt's not if they keep it in the account of hope that maybe I'll make it less risky maybe add some bonds even though that can be risky um you know maybe my retirement date funds you know that can be risky but I'm going to start taking money out over time I'll make it work and hopefully it'll work right\nOr do you have more of a\nConfident plan one that helps you look at petitioning the money for short turn a income income for five years than income for the next five years and then five more in five more you know ten Fifteen twenty thirty thirty five let's take at age one hundred and keep bringing in coming into the income pizza pie\nIn generating that income and maybe getting more fixed income Social Security maybe a pension\nThat you're effects but maybe someone from your own accounts maybe generate more help in that category affects so that income not subject to stock stock market fluctuations and\nYou know now that you know subject to whatever the interest rates and it happened to interest rates whatever the Federal Reserve does with interest rates and not subject to inflation good the plan will give me an opportunity to give yourself a raise overtime and that's important because you want to be able to give yourself a raise overtime\nYou know looking at way again positioning monies to generate that income now in ten years Fifteen twenty thirty thirty five years from now looking at our ideas on that\nBut then also the non financial side the emotional side typical example I had a experienced a couple of years ago a gentleman um was all in ...\nAt your facts but maybe someone from your own accounts maybe generate more help in that category effects so that income is not subject to start a stock market fluctuations and\nYou know now that you know subject to whatever the interest rates you happen to interest rates whatever the Federal Reserve does with interest rates and not subject to inflation good the plan will give me an opportunity to give yourself a raise overtime and that's important because you want to be able to give yourself a raise overtime\nYou know looking at way again positioning monies to generate that income now in ten years and Fifteen twenty thirty thirty five years from now looking at our ideas on that but then also denying financial side the emotional side\nTypical example I had a experienced a couple of years ago\nA gentleman um with all enthused all set to retire at the end of the year December thirty first was going to be the day\nHe tells me that that I'm going to be done um when you looked at the numbers of numbers worked fine for him but he's all excited and gun Andy I'm done and okay that's good calls me up mid January on the following year they had going crazy doesn't always doing\nAnd I go well what's going on here I go with everything okay well yeah the numbers the financial wise is fine\nBut um you know he is thinking about um\nYou know all those problems that he was helping to resolve people calling him and he was like a manager district manager\nIn the people that he was there were helping out every day even though it would bother so all of a sudden he missed it he had he was missing in that sense of like a of being needed any ... was missing the interaction\nYou know even if it was like you know like frustrating he was missing interaction with others other coworkers\nOr something to think about it on a non financial side what are you going to do in retirement you know maybe it's a still working maybe it's a retirement from your current job if you're going to work at something that maybe you have more of a passion for\nOr maybe something you always wanted to do maybe it's part time work maybe it's consulting or maybe it's you know what am\nI Know what I'm doing I'm I'm going to join the club I'm going to play golf or help take care of the grandkids are cetera et cetera\nBut had that discussion and you'll have that thought process we can look at the financial side where we want to also look at the non financial side and that's where I can also you know share some ideas with you help you out let's talk more if

before the end of the year besides taxes maybe looking at your investments right you know looking at the your goals your strategy your risk\nTolerance maybe you got a little lax a little easy on the wrist because everything's been going so good when I'm maybe reevaluate your risk\nOr we can get your DNA number and you go to our website PFC radio dot com and you can see right on the front page of the box and click on to see what your risk number is an easy step to go through it's not the traditional risk tolerance questionnaire that maybe they have you been exposed to\nYou know maybe that one at ... because you're a little bit older that means you should be less risky and now it's gonna take it through a little different stuff a couple a little bit of different exercise certain dollar amount are you comfortable with a potential gain or laws in the next six months yes no\nAnd then I'll take you through the next question similar to that a couple of two or three times and it gives you a number between zero and one hundred\nAnd five hundred being the most risk zero the less risky and we can take that number then eventually compare it\nTo where you're at seeking idea of the risk a risk DNA number\nAlso want to maybe ... you know idea of a position in all your money we talked about that as far as retirement planning the position of your assets or the eventual income in retirement and that becomes part of something maybe there'd be looking at it before the end of the year\nIf you have employee stock options you know when you want to maybe look at how that's going on with that how that plays out for yourself\nAnother idea then to related to investment but overall planning into retirement side before the end of the year he again max or maximize your not your four one K. contributions including catch ups you know a ... you know catch up provisions if you're over age ... fifty and over\nAgain at least taking advantage of the employer match you know looking at if you're making IRA contributions\nCan you do uh maybe I backdoor\nRoth IRA was demi or maybe you don't qualify for Ross contribution\nMaybe it would like to you want to put money into Ross your employer doesn't have it through their retirement plan you like to do a lot but you make too much income\nSo when you do is maybe possibly a look at contributing to an IRA when you say well I can while you can you just can't the doctor had\nNot a duck to Bahrain then right away on the day ... day right after converted to a raw I have to pay tax on the conversion run all because you did not adopted the make that a backdoor off I already contribution I give you more information on that too it's not\nFor everybody but something to be thinking about but you want to look at it again doesn't make sense to put money into Roth doesn't make sense to convert some existing IRA money too raw firing money tax rates are low this ... this year maybe do a portion\nYou know if you have a hundred thousand dollars maybe you convert the whole hundred thousand to a rod you're well wow that's a lot of tax go back to your tax prepare your tax system put that in you say well no I don't like that idea I liked the idea of putting money into the rockets can be tax free\nWe used to I can while you can you just can't the doctor had\nNot a duck to Bahrain then right away on the date second day right after converted to a raw I'll have to pay tax on the conversion run all because you did not the duck did they make that a backdoor Roth IRA contribution I give you more information on that too it's not\nFor everybody but something to be thinking about but you want to look at it again doesn't make sense to put money into Roth doesn't make sense to convert some existing IRA money too raw firing money tax rates are low this ... this year maybe you'd do a portion\nYou know if you have a hundred thousand dollars maybe you convert the whole hundred thousand to a rod you're well wow that's a lot of tax go back to your tax prepare your tax system put that in you say well now I don't like that idea I liked the idea of putting money into the rockets can be tax free\nBut I have to pay the tax now and so maybe instead of putting a hundred thousand enter converting a hundred thousand maybe this convert a portion of it maybe like ten percent of it ten thousand or twenty percent of twenty thousand put it back into your tax system maybe that makes more sense but one thing is very important\nIf you do this you don't have the opportunity anymore to re converted back you cannot re characterize it back that opportunity will not exist anymore in the past and you actually do have it if you can Vernon irate Roth IRA and two thousand Seventeen\nYou have up until October fifteenth of this year to re converted back and re characterize it back\nPerhaps you made a mistake you didn't I I you all underestimated the taxes they owe are\nPossibly but maybe not so much likely the value of your account went down\nSo you pay tax on higher mountain yeah lower my now so maybe you re converted back and then maybe converted back again this year but that re character is to re characterization does not exist anymore going forward so once you convert\nIrate the Roth IRA money that say you're done you can't go back to make sure you get with your ... your advisor your tax preparer\nMake sure

great and thanks for joining us this afternoon Gary it's always a pleasure to have you on the radio show and ah let's see where do we start here I Want to first of all tell the audience about your latest book\nSure my uh latest book is secrets of the secret service that's right it's a history book the secret service\nUm from my perspective which I was in the uniform division and Secret Service and of course the history of the history but I break it down into you know whenever you look up something about the secret service than where you see a a documentary\nYou know we talked about how the secret service has the best of what they do and and they are good people good men and women they start out that way but the secret service is just another example of a large bloated government agency that sometimes can't get out of its own way and I point out some of the mistakes they made over the years and\nSome of the things that really happen during Bill Clinton's impeachment scandal and um it's a little little bit it um if that were done the first book was as a character but it takes a little bit deeper in there with the secret service how there were ... manipulating what was going on\nTo aid the Clintons and and to kind of protect themselves um from having to testify and pushing the uniform division guys like myself for it but\nUm it ... it takes the secret service from the the days of um you know the ah the civil war all the way up into the president and I'm a hope your listeners ... enjoy it\nYeah it sounds very interesting and it on my\nIt's on my short list of must read I have to admit I haven't been able to do that yet because there's quite a lot of good read out there\nYou know I have and how I see this deep yeah it is and I haven't rented a nonfiction book about you know almost ten years because of it so it is it's just been a lot going on Gary so what you tell us\nHow it's going in your effort to reclaim your reputation that that Clinton basically ruined in the end that squeeze play they put on you as an agent you I Believe refused to testify six times in were forced into it or something to that effect or elaborate a bit\nYeah so my unfortunate claim to fame is that I was the first employee of the secret service to ever be compelled to testify against a sitting president in criminal law case and of course I was President Clinton and his impeachment scandal with veterans\nOn my it's on my short list of must read I have to admit I haven't been able to do that yet because it's quite a lot of good read out there\n[laughter] you know I have and how I see this deep yeah it is and I haven't rented a nonfiction book about you know almost ten years because of it so it did just been a lot going on so I don't you tell us\nHow it's going in your effort to reclaim your reputation that that Clinton basically ruined in the end the squeeze play they put on you as an agent you I Believe refused to testify six times in were forced into it or something to that effect or elaborate a bit\nYeah so my unfortunate claim to fame is that I was the first employee of the secret service to ever be compelled to testify against a sitting president in ... criminal law case and of course that was President Clinton and his impeachment scandal with and that involved the Monica Lewinsky the intern\nAnd um you know nobody wanted to have to testify about everybody that worked in the west wing like I did I was poster right outside the oval office for three years during the Clinton time and no you know everybody knew his bizarre life everybody knew what was going on but we kept it to ourselves that was part of our job but\nThen when it turns into a criminal case you know when the story broke when you know a ... I heard it on Howard Stern the DJ good radio show guy broke it broke\nThis story that I'm basically that Matt Drudge posted the night before\nKnew were in trouble I knew what I witnessed and there were some of my co workers had witnessed and um\nI could see how it was going to what we're going to frame up I I could just see it I Swear\nIt uh it flashed in front of my eyes that we were going to end up being pushed against this guy to testify about it but those are her life because he was never going to tell the truth and the executives and the senior guys and the secret service that new I didn't want to ruin their reputations are their career so they pushed us forward\nAnd that's what happened there and I refused um are you went along with the secret service program [noise]\nUm I ... we refused basically six subpoenas and then eventually they tried to invent this thing called the protective function privilege it would be ...\nSimilar to like a spouse can't be compelled to testify against as you know the the spouse the husband and wife or whatever and and that's what they were going for and then eventually the Supreme Court justice at the time Rehnquist he heard their case\nAnd they decided it had no standing and he said I had to testify within Seventy two hours or go to jail so I testified um\nAnd I you know I'm ... and Gary and a layman like myself that's what I call in squeezed plant pretty accurately isn't it\nThat's exactly what it was no it was crazy and I'll tell you you know you mentioned um judge Kavanaugh and and just I don't want to really twisted a little bit here you know how they they they ... and James Cavanaugh I'm telling you\nIs the is the last Boy Scout he really was a boy scout he's a good guy\nEverybody in the government love this guy until they tried to put them on the Supreme Court and just a little twist here one of the things they tried to do to myself and some of my co workers when this started when this story broke and the subpoena started flying from judged are\nThey actually tried to twist is to make it look like Monica Lewinsky was having an affair with one of us like with me one of the other men in the west wing and that's how\nThat's why she was coming in [laughter] that that was the first that was the first thing so first they deny it this is the ... you and I've talked about this many times\nJ. D. Bill Clinton modus operandi of the Clinton machine first they deny its allies it's a right wing conspiracy then they get caught and there's more evidence looks bad men it's not she's not coming to see bill she's coming to see\nBurn or one of these other men that works in the west wing she's not having an affair with President it's what the Secret Service Judy guy because of all the people she can pick that too she wants\nAnd just a little twist here one of the things they tried to do to myself and some of my co workers when this started when the story broke and the subpoena started flying from judged are\nThey actually tried to twist is to make it look like Monica Lewinsky was having an affair with one of us like with me or one of the other men in the west wing and that's how\nThat's why she was coming in [laughter] that's that was the first that was the first thing so first they deny it this is ... ... you and I talked about this many times\nJ. D. Bill Clinton modus operandi the Clinton machine first they deny its ally it's a right wing conspiracy then they get caught and there's more evidence looks bad men it's not she's not coming to see bill she's coming to see\nBurn or one of these other men works in the west wing she's not having an affair with President it's worth the secret service Rudy guy because of all the people she can pick that too she wants is for these guys right you know so and and then when that that that only lasted about a day or so because when they first brought it up to us we just myself\nThe other male officers and the female officers involved we just happen to them is that we threaten the all walk out and go you know go to the press\nAnd and break their little you know cabal of keeping control on us\nAnd uh and so they backed off um but that's that and you know when you look at what they did the Kavanaugh you know two years ago he was\nYou know like they were ready to canonize him because he was such a great judge and everything as soon as they go to put them on the Supreme Court all of a sudden you know he's a beer is willing you know part of you know ah they tried to make them look like a a complete jerk and he's not\nYeah so they try to do the same ... yeah I\nI Believe in in in you know as well as I Do even Democrats aren't buying into this garbage because they they know that Kavanaugh's duty you man who he is yeah and and so this is a big backfired isn't the big sales for the dams and ah yeah\nI heard Chuck Schumer today you might not have said today he might have said it yesterday or friday say that the biggest thing in this election is health care excuse me you're getting a bit of that quake in and help everybody forgets what you will just poll I don't think so Chuck\nYeah what's your name correct me if I'm wrong but I thought it was all about the Russians up a couple of months ago well yeah the residents were a Russian spy or something\nYeah we're going to get into that as well sir but that's what I Want I Want to give us an update if you want to find you have a lawsuit going right to try and reclaim your reputation in last I heard you had standing did you not\nI Do a beautiful thing yeah we're\nWe're we're slowly work in a way forward we started the funding page to help fund the lawsuit not me of course I don't get any money from it but my lawyer a needs money to\nPay the attorney or excuse me to pay the investigators and eventually hope to be ... and in a in a in a camera crew to video us I'm interviewing\nA bill and Hillary Clinton and John Podesta and these other people that were in the lawsuit is a it's a racket civilian racketeering lawsuit it's not about them slandering in the family may call it how they did it I think they they used criminal methods just like a criminal cartel what a drug cartel\nOh you mean like the FBI is doing the Trump oh did I say there are\nVery similar yes no exactly and here's the funny thing and I don't know if it actually involve the FBI but I Do know what I'm Bob the secret service because we know from emails that the secret service\nGave them talking points about me that they could twist to slander me and then they gave him to the retired agents association and then they ran with it and they gave it to two guys a guy named Jonathan\nWe'll be paying to knock of hers and in a in a in a camera crew to video us\nI'm interviewing a bill and Hillary Clinton and John Podesta and these other people that were in the lawsuit is a it's a racket civilian racketeering well through it's not about them slandering in the family may call it how they did it\nI think they they used criminal methods just like a criminal cartel what a drug cartel\nOh you mean like the FBI is doing the Trump oh can I say in a\nVery similar [laughter] yes no exactly and here's the funny thing and I don't know if it actually involve the FBI but I Do know would involve the secret service because we know from emails that the secret service\nGave them talking points about me that they can twist to slander me and then they gave him to the retired agents association and then they ran with it and they gave it to two guys a guy named Jonathan lack Rowan a guy name um [noise]\nI'm ah forget the other guys anybody to come to me in a minute and these guys running around to all the different new news agencies and you know told them I was never there and and I'm\nBrock in his media matters and all those agencies to ... manages picked up on it and said I was never worked there and here's the thing I was going to do is Google my name and Google Gary burn White House security Bill Clinton and it pulls up everything\nI'm going to physically defend myself that's the way up and train I could turn that off and nobody else should either yeah I agree and they're pushing us to they're pushing people to a point\nI'm Sorry it it it they're just way beyond and here's the thing I wanted to bring up\nIs everything to Hillary Clinton is talking about is the exact same opposite of what she said right before she realized she lost the election you\nKnow this is what these people do this is what the Clintons do all the time they take what they you know the stuff that you hear them saying about Trump is really for instance all this stuff about judge Kavanaugh you know who they're describing theirselves Linton yeah that's Bill Clinton's behavior\nI Know that is bill the what they described about what they were they were trying to stake having all did is what Bill Clinton does now as an adult it's what he did when he was at the White House\nThat's on his whole life I Would get\nNo that's exactly right that's a you know what do we know about the have are the best the best protection of future have ever behaviors looking at past behavior\nAnd that's Bill Clinton's behavior it always has been and when it comes to the left and saving these\nThese are these ideals that it's okay to scream and yell at people it's not it's not civil it's not the way we conduct ourselves and you're going to you know they're going to end up um there is already been some small skirmishes and they're going to keep going until somebody who's going to be a catastrophe\nUm and nobody's going to be able to nobody will take responsibility for it they're all like they always do without\nDescribing their cells Clinton yeah that's Bill Clinton's behavior I Know that is bill the what they described about what they were they were trying to think having all did is what Bill Clinton does now as an adult it's what he did when he was at the White House\nWhen he got his whole life I Would guess\nNo that's exactly right that's a you know what do we know about the have are the best the best protection of future have you ever behaviors looking at past behavior\nAnd that's Bill Clinton's behavior it always has been and when it comes to the left and so these\nThese are these ideals that it's okay to scream and yell at people it's not it's not civil it's not the way we conduct ourselves and you're gonna you know they're going to end up um there is already been some small skirmishes and they're going to keep going until somebody who's going to be a catastrophe\nAnd um and nobody's going to be able to nobody will take responsibility for the whole like they always do well that's not what I meant in twenty four hours after Eric Holder made a statement he was trying to backtrack everybody knew what he meant\nYou bet they did and and I was appalled by not surprised but appalled and\nNo no yeah you're right you're exactly right Judy nothing surprises me what they say it's just incredible they're just can't it's like I always I always used the terminology what\nA liberal the last ... liberal you know wherever the quake whatever crazy thing a liberal says the next liberal tries to go even further and they're at the point now where I just don't know you know how they're going to stop it\nSees a lounge at the point where they've actually left the true liberals behind as these left is he's left is are ruining what was the last of the decency of the Democratic party and they're not gonna be any reversing of it as they keep going\nNow that's going to be hard to do you're exactly right\nYeah and and you know I like a separate these days there's a clear delineation in my in my view between a liberal and a leftist\nLiberals do lean left on a lot of issues but they're not America heating lunatics like these left is that our marshalling the antifa robots\nAnd and these kinds of ah these kinds of activities that are going to lead to real civil unrest violence and assassinations not not the least of which we hadn't sixty eight now let me ask you this question how many millennials\nDo you think you could on a on a per cent basis walk up to let's say ask a hundred millennials of all races\nWhat political party ... Dr Martin Luther king was how many of them would come up with the right answer you think you're very few I wouldn't say five to ten percent and I'm being interests nobody no I don't\nThink I don't think it hardly any room with no\nNo because the Democrats have buried their history and they know already jak yeah nobody is we're we're old enough to know that\nThe black community used to be Ninety five percent Republican before the early sixties yeah [laughter] for good reason to by the way you know the history of the Democrat Party\nRight the Democratic party and but at the KKK they did everything they could\nJim Crow K. K. K.\nEverything negative and racist come from the Democrat\nParty it was their their progressive hero Woodrow Wilson the great father of the modern progressive using a movement was eight about racist who actually segregated the United states armed forces correct yeah the one that's been a progressive\nYeah it don't you know do so don't forget I was thinking about this the other day the Democratic party you want it you\nKnow if you think they're they're they're just gotten crazy\nKnow that the black community used to be Ninety five percent Republican before the early sixties yeah [laughter]\nFor good reason to by the way you know the history of the Democratic party\nRight the Democratic party and but at the KKK they did everything they could\nJim Crow KKK everything negative and racist come from the Democrat\nParty it was very their progressive hero Woodrow Wilson the great father of the modern progressive using a movement was eight about racist who actually segregated the United states armed forces correct\nYeah he wanted a progressive\nYeah it don't you know do also don't forget I forget about this the Democratic party you want it you know if you think they're they're they're just gotten crazy in the last couple of years don't forget that they're the same party that ran a candidate\nYou know the rent Ted Kennedy for president in ten or twelve years before or Fifteen Years before he drowned a woman in a car and left her there I mean that's how big are they are\nYeah and not only that that same Ted Kennedy tried to subvert the Nineteen eighty four election by going over to Moscow and colluding with the Russians\nAnd nobody says the paper about it nobody report it we know what's fact we know what happened we we watched it I mean I was young but I Know what happened and then\nThey call them they call them the lion of the running I call him the liar of the Senate\nYeah I mean that guy had more his family and and the and I don't know who pay for it I Wonder now this is part of the Senate that government Congress congressional slush fund\nBut I Know for a fact because I worked in DC for twelve years there there were at least three waitresses worked in restaurants that had that they took legal action against Kennedy and they keep it out of the press because he assault them at the restaurant to keep it out of the press or they were paid off\nYeah and then with some eventually some of the pictures leaked out I thought yeah they did\nSay absolutely just then eventually one of the women All right it's a little bit scary we're coming up in the last Frank I Hope you can hang for one more second which as you want to take any calls\nWe'll take your calls at six zero to seven seven five three six nine eight six six five three six eleven hundred back after the break\nSo\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n... haven't been to Iraq or Lebanon hundred ...
