that were Trump's reasoning or it as we've discussed wouldn't be the first time that a Middle East policy was driven by our thirst for oil\nRight or be energy independent baby don't be be so de

killing of that Saudi journalist\nUm it's clear more makes the case that Trump didn't want the oil sheiks to retaliate by raising the price of oil\nAnd as more goes on to say if that were Trump's reasoning or it as we've discussed wouldn't be the first time that a Middle East policy was driven by our thirst for oil\nUm in fact as Stephen Moore describes you can make a strong case that all American foreign policy in the middle east over the last five decades has been driven by our\nNeed for foreign oil um now the Saudis have threatened to drive the world oil price up which would mean a substantial jump at the pump for\nUs um\nBut here's the deal or for the first time is even more says since the early sixties we we no longer about down when the Saudis threatened to drive the world oil price up because\nUh we now have more energy available to us\nOr than any of these nations that we were so dependent upon and then more goes on to describe what has been a game changer in shale oil and gas revolution that has been a lot of people don't realize is made America\nThe number one oil and gas producer in the world say that again\nAmerica these past few years has become the number one oil and gas producer in the world and that has obviously a free that's up\nFrom being so dependent upon Saudi Arabia and OPEC\nFor our oil um we we have nearly America has nearly tripled our oil and gas production in the last twelve years there's no end in sight\nMost of the analysis says we have two hundred years of production capability without running out right here\nOn in under our soil ah\n... this is all meant to simply say\nThat the best way to continue to punish the Saudis and as more salads and punish the Iranians and punish the Russians for bad behavior uh we just got to keep drilling here at home every barrel of oil\nThat we drill is one last barrel that we have to buy from say Saudi Arabia\n\nThe best way I'm to deal with these Arab sheiks these Arab thugs\nI'm more

the best way to continue to punish the Saudis and as more salads and punish the Iranians and punish the Russians for bad behavior uh we just gotta keep drilling here at home every barrel of oil\nThat we drill is one last barrel that we have to buy from say Saudi Arabia\nIt's the best way I'm to deal with\nThese Arab sheiks these Arab thugs\nI'm more Stephen Moore and the hill today believes are\nThis would actually be the perfect time for Trump to give some sort of a national speech calling for a national crusade for energy independence by twenty twenty and energy dominance says more says by twenty twenty to\nThe future is in our hands um it makes a lot of sense and America First energy plant\n\nSo many people don't realize avoid I speak right now because we've made so much progress\nOr an hour or own oil and gas\nProduction or we've tripled our oil and gas output since two thousand and five\nUh our our carbon emissions have gone down because natural gas from fracking reduces greenhouse gases\nFracking right reduces global warning warming uh last year alone are perceiving more our carbon emissions were down about two percent even as the economy boomed\nSo Stephen Moore then asked the president what are you waiting for Mr President\nYou said many times that you won a future where we are not just energy independent but energy dominant\nTo quote the late great football coach legend George Allen the future is now never again should we be captive to the thug some of the middle east for our energy needs\nPerfectly put Stephen Moore a free market economist in the hill today perfectly put\n\nHow do you get back at how do you punish Saudi Arabia for what they did\n\nAnd if you want to go down that road should they be punished it at our place to punish him it they they are an evil country and evil regime is what it is they are when they are well if if you're gonna get back to Adam if you want to make them\nHurt right or if you want to make them hurt then produce our own oil so that we don't have to pay for their ...\nAnd it's such a Saudi Arabia it's it's it's a Ron it's Russia it's a number of these countries in the middle east we are now at a point in America and this\nBegan before Trump is has been going on now for a number of years\nWe are uh we've become energy independent\nThere is the opportunity here\nAs Stephen Moore spelled out for a America to become energy dominant\n\nWell if if you're gonna get back to Adam if you want to make them hurt\nRight or if you want to make them hurt then produce our own oil show that we don't have to

again and I was just blown away by that I was one of my first ah successes with neuropathy which\nThe next eleven or twelve people that I fixed it ... none of them told me they had a ... when I started working on them either I just was in expecting the muscles while I'm doing the massage finding the are not getting them to release just doing my thing and all of a sudden the you know I people tell me oh I got feeling back oh\nAnd a guy he came back to that place I used to work\nI think three more times get worked on\nAnd the last time he came in and said\nYou know nothing hurts anymore everything's great just to want to get loosened up because I'm going to do the cancer walk up South Mountain this weekend and why don't you haven't been able to do any of those charity walks in about Twenty years and now I feel like I can again and that's just feels great you know it's just a real sense of satisfaction on my part that I'm doing\nDoing good doing good for somebody\nYou know somebody else helping 'em when nobody else could because he had been there all the doctors for years the neurologist and\nYou know they couldn't find anything you know they do at ... am our eyes that X rays the stuff I work on in the muscle tissue does not show up on MRIs and an X rays um it's just it's muscle tissue unless you're physically feeling\nThe fibers muscle with your hand and it didn't have the developed sense of touch I have you're not going to ... you're not going to find it yeah and you've got to know where you're looking which I Do I Know where the ... nurses are in your body I Know where the muscles are all in your body\nIs a pretty much everybody's got the same muscles save nerves\nSo it's not you know not hard to find it with my experience of mice courses study you know I

that said oh yeah the medication does fine I don't get migraines\nEverybody says oh yeah I still get migraines\nYeah some people say it's not as severe as it used to be but everybody's still get

I actually have a few of my clients they actually will fall asleep while I'm working on them they\nThey trust that I can find where the areas that are bothering them are they give you a couple of them you know it's like oh yeah I also love shoulders been bugging me again and\nThe other back because I I Do have a lot of people that yes I can fix what's their problem is but their occupation makes a

just like a massage but I'm Talking to you a lot more yeah I got the music playing in the background just 'cause\nIt's something to fill the silence when there is silence but sometimes I actually have a few of my clients they actually will fall asleep while I'm working on um they\nThey trust that I can find where the areas that are bothering them are they give you a couple of them you know it's like oh yeah ... left shoulders been bugging me again and\nThe other back 'cause I I Do have a lot of people that yes I can fix what's ... their problem is but their occupation makes a comeback\nYeah one guy as a he's a truck driver so he's you know shifting or Eighteen wheeler you drive in\nTen hours a day seven days a week or six days a week ago however much you can drive for a couple of weeks straight no days off and so he ends up three injuring these muscles restraining them\nAnd I yeah I have to work on some of the same stuff every now and then on him but ah the headaches or\nCan be avoided getting I'm back in general by the way you hold your body the way you sit the way you stare at the computer the way you stare at your cell phones\nYou just read one of the things I teach people to remember is to drop your shoulders we all do it we all start tightening up our shoulders and shrug it up our shoulders when we're thinking a lot are concentrating are under stress\nBecause that's a fight or flight instinct it's been in that one little part on the top of her head that part of our brain since a caveman days used to serve us really wild because the only time back then that we were really thinking a lot was when we were hunting or there was a danger around\nSo that part of the brain starts tightening up certain muscle groups so you're ready to take off running climate tree or getting a fight with a banner\nProtect yourself in that part of the brain really never did it evolve you know we got smarter we got you know better technology we got everything going for us now but that one part of the brain as soon as your mind it gets real active it starts tightening up muscles for no good reason now there's just no point to it\nBut we have to consciously remember to drop our shoulders down throughout the day so when I tell people that do is remember the phrase it's time to drop my shoulders so let looking at the time be your cue to drop your shoulders when you look at the time on your phone you look at the time on your restaurant you look at the clock on the wall we look at the time a hundred times a day at least\nPersonally I have to remember to drop my shoulders down forty or fifty times a day 'cause I'll catch myself with my shoulders out\n'cause we're always thinking now you know it doesn't have to be stressful adjust just thinking a lot and the cell phones again try to hold your cell phone around shoulder level I'm not saying don't use your cell phone's just hold them up higher so you're not in your head down staring at your phone that's got a strain your neck\nAgain go to my website pain management Arizona dot com for more information on where am I locations are and how to book an appointment\nUse your cell phone just all of them up higher so you're not\nIn your head down staring at your phone that's good a strain your neck again go to my website pain management Arizona dot\nThe signal back to the brain\nAnd I can get on that leg and find where all the nights are gently release a mall and most people do get get feeling back at that team that funny feeling to go away\nAnd the frozen older is yeah you got to be a lot of the same muscles around this cap yellow you've heard that the term uh the uh rotator cuff\nYeah which is rotator cuff is just a generic term ... for for muscles of the shoulder that connected as Scott ... shoulder blade\nEars and uh you know we get in there we work work on those muscles because those are the main four muscles and the rotator cuff that allow free and fluid movement of the shoulders so we could get in there like I said you know I I I eat\nIntel I get my my hands on yet and really feel around in those muscle groups that are probably causing the pain or discomfort that's when I find where the problem is you know Dr ... oh go ahead\nNo I'm Single and going\nOh well doctors they kind of like go doctors basically go off what others have written down before them\nYou know if you come in with symptoms a B and C they are going to say yeah I read in a book it's if it's ABC it's D I F is what you have and we're going to do X Y Z to treat that they don't say hey let me you really find where the problem is and treated\nSo definitely a yoga have her make an appointment like I said if she wants to come to the Peoria location I even have a ten dollar offers visits at the Peoria

up\nYeah the thing yeah one one we only go so far yeah ... that's the that's part of that frozen shoulder thing 'cause I there there's several muscles that could be the terrorists miners are very common that's been muscle right on your armpit\nThat goes from you know around the upper rib cage up to ... the upper arm there\nOr you got a super ... subs calculators I consider her name so many muscles that could be involved that it's basically something she did at some point she strained that muscle and several of the fibers got stuck in a tight position and now they're not able to relax so that muscle is kind of\nStaying flexed in one little side of the muscle fibers is kind of locked in this in the in the flexed position like pulling the arm back down word so when she tries to extended that muscle cannot\nRelief because for every op action there's a opposite reaction so when you straighten your arm muscles half to relax some muscles flex we'd ... century\nHave repaired and range and

back pain and they come to find out that they have a herniated disc or a ruptured discs in their spine\nAnd that's what's pressing on the nerve and it's not a neuro muscular thing it's actually a damage in the in the uh\nThe uh desk between the vertebrae that's causing\nThe the ... the term came to my head that's like a structural structural\nTherapist\nYes um that's normally somebody that will do facilitated stretching as well so they will grab your arm and pull it in directions and work the muscle while they're pulling it\nAnd it is I normally don't do that I normally don't find that necessary I find once I get into the muscle and find where the nights are gently release them\nThe problem just is gone you know she could very easily and all in one section ... ... ...

states\nYou do not let those people come through your country to our country is seen Mexico is always cared a lot about its southern border and they guarded fiercely but they don't care about is their

Mexico that is annually a thirty\nFive to forty billion dollar plus for the country of Mexico all that extra money remittances they call it coming back in New Mexico it's easy money from Mexico\nAnd then all those green American dollars aid Mexico's economy it also gives some relief because Mexico doesn't have the kind of unemployment problem that it would have\nIf all those illegal workers had stayed at home\nSo that takes some pressure off it also takes the pressure of Mexico because then they might have to reform they are a country that really in some ways has a lot going for it they have a lot of territory a lot of land you need that they have a lot of workers people who are willing to do labor they have money\nAnd they have oil\nYou take all those things energy land capital and labor and you almost can't go wrong\nBut then you inject one other factor in corruption where the top five percent of Mexico takes most of what the country produces and the other Ninety five percent gets

campaign in the summer of twenty Fifteen or Mike Lewis joins me out with the he writes for the hill Mike it's good to have you on the program thanks for the time to nine\n... thanks for having me appreciate it show there are folks who are saying that President Trump is ramping up on immigration is that even possible for Donald Trump to get tougher on immigration that he's been to one\nBut that's a great question uh you know the answer is no but it allows them to return an issue that has really been in the headline frequently\nAnd so whether or not he's ramping it up I guess it ... it but it hasn't been in the headlines and now it is and so the caravan of kind of given him an opportunity to kind of low hanging\nFruit at the softball and uh and he thinks that he's just going to hit it hit it out of the car right ahead of the midterm election so your ah your point is well made a he hasn't ramped up really anything it's the same position that he had all along\nBut it doesn't allow him to uh to to re enter this into the news cycle at a very crucial thought\nWell maybe maybe if Nancy Pelosi gets conspiratorial she could say Donald Trump or range for the caravan to arrive in precisely the right moment before the midterm so that he could bring it back up do you think she can launch conspiracy theory like that\nI was trying to think she could properly drink something like that I thought you know right now you get a lot of finger pointing across the aisle jumped the courses blaming the Democrats for allowing the caravan to come up and the Democrats are pointing right back across that him and saying\nWait a minute we don't cook control the government wants to do something about the conditions down there ah in in Central America so of course it's going to be a blame game this immigration in Washington and a ... and the fingers are going to be pointing all around and and that has to change the course just\nA edited elections it's only going to get a more heated\nWell Mike let me ask you this and this may sound a little crazy but I'll I'll throw it out you anyway or is it possible since we now live in a world where anybody with a smartphone anywhere on the planet knows can know what's going on in another country\nIs it possible this caravan shows precisely this moment because it is around the midterms not because they wanted to help their friends and the Democratic party but because they thought it's time to get into the into the United states before we hit those midterms and perhaps we see some changes\nBut you know I think if if they were if they were thinking that that politically I think that they would have I think they would have waited as you know with the house a kind of favorite\nBlame game this is the immigration in Washington and a ... and the fingers are going to be pointing all around and and that hasn't changed of course just a headed these elections it's only going to get a more heated\nMike let me ask you this and this may sound a little crazy but all all thrown at you anyway or is it possible since we now live in a world where anybody with a smartphone anywhere on the planet knows can know what's going on in another country\nIs it possible this caravan shows precisely this moment because it is around the midterms not because they wanted to help their friends and the Democratic party but because they thought it's time to get into the into the United states before we hit those midterms and perhaps we see some changes\n[noise] well you know I think if if they were if they were thinking that you're that politically I think that they would have I think they would have waited as you know with the house a kind of favorite to flip to the Democrats right now I think they would just think that has a better chance of getting across later\nIn the year or next year or if the Democrats and below sea do take the gavel I you know I think\nUh you you talk to at least you talk to the advocates and you talk to the diplomats down there and there is a lot of violence right there are people legitimately fleeing a very dire situation and and and then of course they're going to be a lot of hangers on who are just trying to take advantage of that situation and get across the border when in fact they are probably not\nIn any jeopardy but uh you you talked to the at least to the advocates and those on the ground down there and they think that the you know this wouldn't have nothing to do with politics that if it did that they would certainly wait until next year a assuming that the that the house would flip\nWell the other thing about that is that do I understand correctly 'cause I I Do keep an eye on this topic is one of my favorites for the last Twenty years is one that we ought to resolve that are\nThat the ... ... if you say I'm coming from a country where I'm being persecuted by the government because of my race religion national origin or any of the other protected categories that you have a good chance of being approved as a refugee on the other hand about eighty five percent of refugee claims are refused because people say\nMy country has a stinky economy or my country has you know crime problems that those under the law or not legitimate reasons to claim refugee status\nAnd certainly yes you're exactly right and then there are going to be both of course you know people are going to get to the border and\nAnd saw him again or probably in a very dire situation uh you know whether it's gang violence or domestic abuse or or whatever the situation is they're legitimate claims and those people are by and large are are approved after they go through the process\nThen again you're going to have the hangers on who are just trying to take advantage of a of a of an opportunity here\nAnd uh you know to to claim that poverty is a reason to seek a asylum status or refugee status of course that you know judge up here it's going to accept that and those people will cause the refused and deported um but you're certainly right you know the the broader point that we do have a process in place that\nUh that once people do arrive at the border there is a process that detain a and they have to go before a judge before anything can happen and what the Trump Administration is trying to prevent that from happening at all\nBy having Mexico where some of the Central American government stop the caravan before it even gets to the border so that's kind of where we are right now the negotiation with the Mexican\nA law makers Mexican leaders Mexican authorities and uh there was some rumbling yesterday that a Mexican leaders had said that they would take care of it before they reached the border so this might fizzle out before before they even get to Texas or anywhere on the southern border but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out\nI'm Talking to Michael Lewis who writes for the hill dot com that's the other piece of this and I want to know if I'm overreaching because I Am a Trump fan but when the caravan started and it was maybe\nCertainly right you know the the the broader point that we do have a process in place that uh that once people do arrive at the border there is a process that detain a and they have to go before a judge before anything can happen and what the Trump Administration is trying to prevent that from happening at all\nBy having Mexico where some of the Central American government stop the caravan before it even gets to the border so that's kind of where we are right now the negotiation with the Mexican\nA law

out before it before they even get to Texas or anywhere on the southern border but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out\nI'm Talking to my littlest who writes for the hill dot com that's the other piece of this and I want to know if I'm overreaching because I Am a Trump fan but when the ... started and it was maybe a thousand before grew to four\nThousand is it is now may be even bigger than that by now or the president said to Honduras pull that caravan back or you lose your foreign aid\nHe told the same to Guatemala and then he told Mexico you let those folks across and you may find yourself without a trade deal now I was guessing that does seem to be some pretty powerful motivating\nPushes from the president is that the reason that Mexico isn't just opening up the gate and loving them come into Mexico and then head up the road toward America\nMexico is doing is offering work visas to a lot of these people say you know all these countries have different relationships and they have different laws and processes that would a company you know people who wanted to\nTo leave or enter a a a a sovereign country um you know the Guatemalan government can't very well tell its citizens that they can't travel outside of the country so\nUh I don't know what legal authority they would have to do so and then in ... Mexico I'm sure it has some kind of visa\nAgreement with all of the Central American countries in is probably very lenient and there's probably this probably very easy to come and go so what we were hearing yesterday is that the Mexican government was going to offer some work visas and try to get a those people to stay\nIn Mexico and not ... not reached the border\nAs a kind of an appeasement strategy for Trump because he is threatening\nTo close the border he was threatening to put military force at the border and he was a threatening described most importantly threatening to scrap the newly a negotiated NAFTA deal and of course Mexico a doesn't want any of those things to happen so I I think they're scrambling they're they're trying to figure out a way\nTo uh to peace President Trump and prevent this caravan for reaching the border\nMike this is the first time I can remember any American president Republican or Democrat doing that kinda thing telling Mexico knock it off and help us out or you're going to you're going to suffer can you think of another example where president has done that\nI can smell and you know and and you don't have to go back very hard to remember you know who remember the ... at the border we talked about under President Obama um and and there were just you know thousands and thousands of people and and and a lot of them unaccompanied minors that was\nWhen that first started happening or as a result of a lot of the the gangs the escalation of gang violence down there with the purported reason and uh but I Know President Trump wasn't you know pressing those governments to stop the people before they arrived he was just scrambling to find ways to process them once they did\nAnd of course that's why you had all these detention centers or you know President Obama long before President Trump had entered centers or what he didn't do a separate the families which I think that's why that issue blew up\nUm but you know you hear about immigration judges and the lack of immigration judges and these people get up here and there months or even years sometimes waiting to be processed and so it's it's just a bottleneck if the backlogs and a ... I was just a mess when it's when a surge like that happened\nBut uh to your point no I've never heard\nOn a company minors that was when I first started happening or as a result of a lot of the gang the escalation of gang violence down there with the recorded reason and uh but now President Trump wasn't you know some of those governments to stop the people before they arrived he was just\nGoing to find ways to process them once they did\nAnd of course that's why you had all the attention and are are you know President Obama long before President Trump had entered\nA what you didn't do a separate families which I think why that is a little up\nI'm like you know you hear about immigration judges and the at the lack of immigration judges and people get up here in the months or even years sometimes waiting process and so it's just a bottleneck backlogs and uh I was just a mess when I started like that happened\nBut uh to your point no never heard of a president at least in modern history\nWhat it is here so if you have those kinds of incentives and your kids get to go to school paid for by taxpayers and if you come in as a refugee\nLet me tell you one little detail from the law and Michael if you are given refugee status and eighty five percent of refugees do not get refugee status they're simply told your circumstances don't justify it\nYou are allowed to access all of America's social service programs so welfare food stamps tan of a section eight housing Medicaid all the rest of that so it's a sweet deal if you can get it as a refugee you could work and make them\nFar more money than you made back at home you can be reasonably save at least compared to back at home\nYour kids get to go to school you get medical care and you can access all those free goodies paid for by the American taxpayer and if anybody thinks that to write or fair or just or legal\nI think you've got to take another look at the wall let's go to norm norm welcome to walk to the Lars Larson show what's on your mind\nYeah no I ... a ... an addict question that the gentleman that news reporter this methane Jamal ...\nYeah yeah he he was ... you know he's an Arab here on a green card like anybody else that\nGoes for their country true\nSo why should it be an international day any more than if if if the law and order thorough and home and got killed plenty of it and they all thought well\nI ... I can tell you one if you want me to make the argument for why it should be a story if somebody I went to the American consulate\nOr just or legal I think you've got to take another look at the wall let's go to norm norm welcome to walk into the Lars Larson show what's on your mind\nYeah no I ... a ... an epic quest to get on a\nNews reporter that's Jamal ... yeah yeah he he was ... you know he's an Arab here are they going to guard like anybody else that\nGoes on for a true\nLife shit man show today any more than if if if the law and order or at home and he got killed Bob well\nI I can tell you one if you want me to make the argument for why it should be a story\nIf somebody I went to the American consulate in Russia or Japan or France\nAnd they ended up murdered inside that consulate\nAnd it's a conflict that say from a friendly\nCountry or or contract until at least ... billion ally of the United states that would be an ... that would be a major story that's not just some foreign national who's gone home and and goes to an M ... and goes out and gets killed in a mugging or a of a crime of some kind\nThis is somebody who was allegedly killed in an embassy now I Believe\nThat his murder maybe more the result of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood the\nFact that uh he was a friend of Osama bin Laden and that he identified where they you know the the ridiculous ... end of Islam\nAnd that had more to do with it and the fact that MBBS the guy runs the crown prince who runs Saudi Arabia right now is trying to westernize that country and the sharia folks\nThe hardcore Islam is do not want that to happen I think that may be more to explain why he ended up dead then the Saudi Government just simply saying we're going to silence a critic by murdering him but he wasn't just a journalist he was a political actor as well\nAnd for the most part I understand our media tells intends to tilt to the left but we'd say tell to the left imagine somebody\nWho worked for a and teeth are one of these dug huge crowd the drop in American cities also worked for a major newspaper or a major news organization like CNN\nAnd they played both roles the role of being a political activist as well as the role of being a journalist on television most television outfits even the folks at the chicken noodle news network would not tolerate having somebody on\nThey'll do it for commentators\nBut they will not do it for somebody who's straight ahead news reporter which is what ... is being presented to Americans and all these stories ads but he was a political actor I mean if you said I have a job with the Democratic National Committee as one of their staffers but I'm also working as a journalist at CNN\nCNN would say no we're not going to let that happen unless you're on as a commentator but if you're just simply a news reporter so what they're trying to portray this as his\nThis man was a journalist he wanted to tell the truth about Saudi Arabia and he was murdered for being a good journalists\nI have a feeling that when we finally find out the details that we're going to find out that he was also a political actor and he was pushing a narrative that was anti Saudi Government right now because he wants to the Saudi Government to go back the other direction this the ... that country while they've not always been the best friend\nThey have been an ally to the United states and I think what the left would like to do are left would like to do is drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia and Washington DC and the fact is what do you like it or not if we are going to be an actor in that region and we do have to because that region could end up being a national security threats\nUh unless you're on as a commentator but if you're just simply a news reporter so what they're trying to portray this as is this man was a journalist he wanted to tell the truth about Saudi Arabia and he was murdered for being a good journalists\nI have a feeling that when we finally find out the details that we're going to find out that he was also a political actor and he was pushing a narrative that was anti Saudi Government right now because he wants to the Saudi Government to go back the other direction was the ... that country while they've not always been the best friend\nThey have been an allied to the United states and I think what the left\nWould like to do are left would like to do is drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia\nAnd Washington DC and the fact is what do you like it or not if we're going to be an actor in that region and we do have to because that region could end up being a national security threat to our country we need some allies there we have one in uh in Israel\nWe could have had one in Iraq but we let them\nFall apart when Obama pulled all the troops out and now we've got troops back in there but that could have been a a a freely elected a government with the constitution was written while we were still there we haven't done that and we could have had one in Saudi Arabia\nAnd one is that region started to have real you know government of the people instead of government is being run by either dictators or royal families then when you got one next door you say well why can't our country like Iran why can't we have one that's more responsive\nTo the public they don't right now but they could and the minute you get one next door you're going to say well hey why can't we have a deal like that\nAnd I think the Islamic hardliners\nThey don't want that to happen and they'll kill anybody in a way of stopping that

A. O. recounts that say\nIf the postal service doesn't pay for its pensions American taxpayers will so every dime they lose while they're under charge\nIt's obviously part of a sort of brought her after the administration is doing to try and find every sort of way an ankle they can to put pressure on China changes trade policies\nAnd to be honest at me very inventive that coming up with new ways to do this I mean this postal union thing is one something that's been under the radar for a long time and it's just an interesting kind of ingenious ways they found it put pressure on\nWell beyond the political pressure let's start with is Sean is there a case to be made that it's not as subsidy to China because after all the postal service loses usually half\nA billion to a billion dollars every year and while they're in ... officially they're an independent government agency and they haven't been making all their pension payments and I've read the G. A. O. recounts that say\nIf the postal service doesn't pay for its pensions American taxpayers will so every time they lose while they're under charging a customer is a dime a or a dollar or a billion dollars that American taxpayers are going to have to pay\nIs there an argument made that were charging a fair rate to China and they shouldn't be paying more\nUm that's interesting question I mean I hadn't really thought about it in those terms I Will say that uh\nYou know the post ... there's nothing there's nothing to prevent the postal service for simply or the administration physically I'm charging China a larger rates which is what they may in fact eventually be doing as the consequences of this administration's a decision on this side of this sort of signal the scent of wanting to China or\nThat that that it may do that and that's basically what they're attempting to do so if if the question is can we get more money coming in the U.S postal service that's actually a viable question and something that may actually be looking to do later on down the line\nBut this also has implications for\nWell I guess for the way they're trying to compete for the United states because as I understand it the UP you this is this the United nations agency a says we're going to allow a flat rate for packages up to four point four pounds so if somebody goes on Amazon and buy something from China\nAnd you know buy something and whether they know it's coming from China or not it shipped from China you have the packages for point four pounds that's two kilos or less uh then they get charged a flat rate and that that allows foreign\nCompanies to undercut us competitors who have to pay market right well at least if they're sending things by FedEx or UPS or the other carriers in this country they pay market rate\nUm shouldn't shouldn't we did this does having an implication for people buying things because if you find all of a sudden that you're going to have to pay more to ship things if they're coming from China that might actually make American goods are goods from other places competitive where they're not today and the only difference\nCould be the shipping cause right\nThat's exactly that's exactly it and I believe that sort of vehicles the administration is looking at him and a lot of business organizations in the U.S have been making you know precisely that argument that you know it's just simply unfairly trying to be able to do it this way and we need to do something differently and a lot of them are very pleased with the ministry of ... you know picking up the\nBaton on this for like for a\nWhile I guess I'm interested to and the implications for the postal service I mean I don't know how many packages are coming from China but given the volume that Amazon is selling I've a\nFeeling it's probably a lot and if you you know if every one of them caused another dollar a dollar and a half to ship a that would not only have implications for U.S companies that are trying to sell to American consumers but it would it have an ... an implication for the postal service to have all of a sudden the rates went up\nTo something that's more like a market rate\nAnd they were a bit higher on a few tens of millions of packages that could make a big difference\nNow is that now you're exactly right on that point it could it could make a substantial difference I mean part of the thing\nThat you know it's just simply unfairly trying to be able to do it this way and we need to do something differently and a lot of them are very pleased with the administration is is you know picking up the baton on this for like for a\nWhile I guess I'm interested to and the implications for the postal service I mean I don't know how many packages are coming from China but given the volume that Amazon and selling I've a\nFeeling it's probably a lot and if you you know if every one of them cause another dollar a dollar and a half to ship\nA that would not only have implications for U.S companies that are trying to sell to American consumers but it would it have an ... an implication for the postal service to have all of a sudden the rates went up to something that's more like a market rate\nAnd they were a bit higher on a few tens of millions of packages that could make a big difference\nNow is that now you're exactly right on that point it could it could make a substantial difference I mean part of the thing well what's interesting about the Trump Administration is that they are\nBasically sort of turning over all these rocks hum of issues that\nPeople haven't looked at her thought about in a long time and forcing people to you know to to deal with him and says well as again is another one of those sort of interesting cases where they're doing that where they're forcing because this has been something that's been going on with the sort of process for decades in the first one to say hey wait a minute why are we doing it this way it was a different way and that's one of the interesting things about the ministry racial\nWell especially because and this is going on from sixty nine to president we've essentially had no no difference in the rates that are being charged flat rates that are being charged for shipping packages is that the that the case or has there been some kind of inflation escalator and that over the over the last forty or fifty years\nI don't know if it's been I don't know if it's been adjusted for inflation or not I mean there's a ... I Believe the rate has remained the same whether whether that's a you know I I don't actually know the exact mechanism weather works as a percentage or not I'm not sure but the rate has remained consistent whether or not it it's a ... percentage I'm into Somalia\nSean you you sound like you're a bit younger than me but\nWould you like to be paying for gasoline let's say what you were paying a Nineteen sixty nine if you were buying gasoline and they ... I was mowing lawns so I was buying gasoline in Nineteen sixty nine and I know what it costs then and I know what it costs now I'd love to have Nineteen sixty nine gasoline rights or rent\nI remember my parents used to be a hundred dollars a month for a very nice house for rent\nAnd and I'd love to be paying a hundred dollars a month to rent an apartment I'll bet a lot of other Americans would do\nWhy is it that until we get a real business man in office like Donald Trump nobody any of these administrations as a you know Bush or Clinton or or or a bomb or anyone else has said hey maybe we should bring that raid forward why are we still charging the Nineteen sixty nine right\nIt's I mean it it's that and that's a good question and the answers that\nAs well so many things it's just so much easier to say I find whatever let let's just let it let it be and move on to something else it's somewhat more pressing um and just not deal with it I mean there's there's so many sort of things that just having been looked at\nHer address talked about in a long time um and this is another one of the sort of issues and there's a lot of things that they brought up and when they were talking about the you know the trade you know the NAFTA deal and other things that people haven't talked about her address in a while and this is in\nYeah I mean it's ... the answer your question is\nPeople should have people should have been looking and asking these fundamental\nQuestions and there's just that sort of mindset of standard sort of Washington that never really bother to do it and what things about Trump is that he doesn't subscribe that mine sent me and sometimes he goes a little bit of a off the edge and on some areas but other times you know take somebody who thinks that way to sort of a look at these issues and say\nYou know do we really need to do it this way I mean now that you know the NAFTA negotiations for a good example I mean for a long time people there want staying what's going on is working fine we don't need to address this really to rock the boat and Trump said no I Wanna rock the boat and see what happens yeah\nI'm In this is another one of the sort of issues and there's a lot of things that they brought up and when they were talking about that you know the trade you know the NAFTA deal and other things that people haven't talked about her address in a while and this is in yeah I mean it's ... the answer your question is\nPeople should have people should have been looking and asking these fundamental questions and\nThere's just that sort of mind set of standards sort of Washington but never really bother to do it and what things about Trump is that he doesn't subscribe to that mindset me and sometimes he goes a little bit of a off the edge and on some areas but other times you know take somebody who thinks that way to sort of a look at these issues and say\nYou know do we really need to do it this way I mean you know that you know the NAFTA negotiations for a good example I mean it's a long time people there want staying what's going on it's working fine we don't need to address this really to rock the boat and Trump's at you know I'm going to vote and see what happens yeah that's exactly what you're doing that again with the decision\nWell it just kinda stuns me because I have a feeling there isn't a company out there in the private sector who doesn't say what are we charging for this is that what our competitors are charging is that what the market will bear and maybe back in Nineteen sixty nine I don't know how much stuff was getting shipped from China\nI mean before uh before next and even sort of open the open notes up an open shine up so we had better relations with them I'm not sure how much stuff was getting shipped anyway probably not nearly the volume today but\nThat um that maintenance backlog now\nLet me ask you this because I've always wanted to run the numbers my wife and I buy an annual pass every year and I think it's Seventy five or eighty bucks and there's a very good deals you just going to go to one of the parts one time on one day every year I think you pay thirty bucks\nBut if you buy Seventy five or eighty dollar pass and maybe a little bit more now that they would uh you know that that let you go to any national park you want all year long and it's a it's a pretty good deal\nAnd I feel that part of this bill should be paid by everybody in America because they're available to everybody but those of us who want to use the parks we pay a little bit more and I don't think that's necessarily wrong I don't think the visitors should pay the entire ... nor do I think the taxpayer should pay the whole tab\nHis her away and I keep wanting twelve billion so we spent a billion a year on top of whatever we're spending now in the poor maintenance we're doing right now we we would catch up and about a decade which wouldn't be a bad gold shoot for be nice to do it in five years instead of ten where you could do that\nHow many people visit all of the national parks in a way that would cause them to pay an entry for your show their past you know\nAnd it's that's that's a great question I Know that millions of people go to the parks here and I think what this restore our parks um legislation does which has bipartisan support is that it it doesn't\nYou know drug or create an additional burden on the taxpayer and in fact the six point five billion dollars which does legislation propose is um towards is almost twelve billion dollar deficit over five years comes from a federal middle revenues so this is on showing offshore oil and gas\n... the whole tab user away kind of keep wanting twelve billion ... billion a year on top of what we're spending now in the ... right now we we would catch up and about a decade which wouldn't be a bad gold shoot for be nice to do it in five years and so the gym where you could do that\nHow many people visit all of the national parks you know where that would cause them to pay an entry for your show their past you know\nI'm I'm it's that's that's a great question I Know there are millions of people go to the parks here and I think what this restore our parks um legislation does which has bipartisan support is that it it doesn't\nYou know job or a create an additional burden on the taxpayer and in fact\nThe six point five billion dollars which the legislation proposes um towards this almost twelve billion dollar deficit over five years comes from federal middle revenues onto this is on showing offshore oil and gas I'm so these are things that\nWe um those funds that are already there but they're not earmark on right now for national parks are allocated to other programs but I'm legislation\nFederal budget expert either monitor but if the if money wasn't going to the park to would go to the general treasury and it'd be available for all the other stuff the federal government bonds right\nYeah well the way that these funds are I mean what we are proposing is to to reallocate these funds to to the park so it's not necessarily um you know pulling drawing down our adamant increased burden on the taxpayer\nAnd what it does is it's just a identifying a pot of money that we haven't thought about um that could benefit the national parks and I and I think you know what that does of course is with this um six point six and a half billion dollar influx of funds I think on the back end and you know\nYou're talking finding on it's always return on investment right so investing this as a country or what are we going to get back for it\nAnd you know to that I went there I mean we'll we'll have the you know the statue of liberty I Will be preserved and that has a a backlog of maintenance backlog right now Ellis Island and we know how important um you know that was a stopping point in our American story um you know that places like the\nLittle Rock Central High school um in in in Arkansas and that is a historic site and brown v board of education at that\nYou know these are the historic places that tell our story and so we have a ... we have places we can go to talk about um who we are as a country and to get to the numbers of things I mean um we um had an analysis done by the cat and his group and they found that if\nThe if this legislation passed it would create a hundred and ten thousand infrastructure related jobs and so that directly impacts local and caught economies at these national parks are part of and so I Would say you know\nBy redirecting these funds it's a it's an immediate return on investment um for where these local communities can get and the job they create um by just restoring places that we already know hum are important to to who we are as a country\nTo monitor who's opposing\nUp you know up right now there's a bipartisan support sauce on on both sides I think right now we're we're trying\nTo get through and we're hoping to get this legislation passed in the next month or two so after the election um to to really get boots on the ground and and get to work around are around us\nSo we're we're you know kind of caught into um the the bill is now in the legislation of Alan subcommittee it's coming out of that soon but we you know or need to the Congress to act right now uh to to get this passed for us\nTo do something that we've already got bipartisan support it should be a done deal done is anybody playing politics with those same we're we're not doing that until you do something else\nYou know I'm I'm I Would say I'm I'm sure that that he is the case but [laughter] but but I you know I Would also argue that I I I'm a big huge preservation is in fact you know of of course I worked for the national\nYou know up right now there's a bipartisan support so it's all on both sides I think right now we're we're trying\nTo get through and we're helping 'em to get this legislation passed in the next month or two so after the election um to to really get boots on the ground and and get to work around a around as\nIt were were you know kind of caught and to um the the deal is now in in the legislation is now in sub committee that's coming out of that soon but we need to the Congress to act right now a ticket to pass rest\nSo it is something that if they've already got bipartisan support it should be a done deal done is anybody playing politics with this ... we're not doing that until you do something else\nYou know I'm I'm I Would say I'm I'm sure that that is\nThe case but [laughter] but but I you know I Would also argue that yeah I I I'm a big huge preservation is is that yes of course I worked for the national trust 'em you know but\nYou know preservation is a is a bipartisan I'm a you know it's it's good for Republicans and Democrats I guess good inside the locker about our heritage I just hope that I think it would be hard for somebody to oppose it on that\nToo but I I just figure on Capitol Hill they don't even agree to go to lunch I'll go to lunch for my farm bill well I'm not going to lunch with you unless you vote for my damn bill or that\nKind

criticize\nYou hit that come in the day but I could be correct and I am currently a real rep toyed fourteen years old from the planet ten dollar you\nKnow the Hillary is one of my hat Clinton's\nRoyal any point in a whole other criticize her uh what do you think of medicine I\nI think if we could show that she was at least the our point zero nine percent reptilian DNA band measured qualified just like Elizabeth Warren qualifies for being a Cherokee but no Alex ... you know we look at the Elizabeth Warren bang it was it should've been consider to be satire\nAnd I thought it was perfect that the Bible and he did that story saying that after looking at Elizabeth Warren's thing ... had her own DNA tests that she's had those conservative July I'm not a hundred percent reptilian DNA I'm only fifty percent now what what are the Daily Beast did\nWas really reprehensible on a number of levels are they came out yesterday at five twenty six pm eastern standard time\nOr they came out said our

Facebook now of course they don't mention the fact\nThat YouTube and Facebook and apple recruiting they did it within hours of each other all of them doing it at the same time and then of course they also included with the press and we saw this pattern happen again last week\nUh we had another eight hundred alternative media sites that were shut down Facebook and Twitter within hours of each other depressing\nAnd I thought it was perfect that the Bible and but you did that story saying that after looking at Elizabeth Warren's thing Hillary had her own DNA tests that she's had those conservatives align I'm not a hundred percent reptilian DNA I'm only fifty percent now what what are the Daily Beast did\nWas really reprehensible on a number of levels are they came out yesterday at five twenty six pm eastern standard time\nOr they came out and said I was chosen for wars that lower permanently banned from Twitter in September ... moved seemed to be a death blow for info wars just weeks before the makeup of platforms like YouTube and Facebook now of course they don't mention the fact\nThat YouTube and Facebook and apple recruiting they did it within hours of each other all of them doing it at the same time and then of course they also included with the press and we saw this pattern happen again last week\nUh we had another eight hundred alternative media sites that were shut down Facebook and Twitter within hours of each other the press it already been notified the press already had their stories ready to run just like they did with us\nSo they're they're wringing their hands of the Daily Beast saying well they should be down but they're still up\nHow are they fill up how they still are communicating with people and how do we get them off for the remaining social media sites and so they then site me they said in fact two months after Jones and infowars are supposedly ... a number of accounts remain live tweeting on Tuesday the Twitter account for infowars real new show\nHost David night promoted nights claim that Hillary Clinton is quote fifty percent reptilian DNA\nSo they put that out there as if I'm taking that seriously you know it is a satire or Elizabeth Warren's claims are satire but Alex the real amazing thing about this to me is that it was the Daily Beast that was attacking Danny Williams when he was asking a real question a Bill Clinton\nAnd that was please take a DNA test so I can know who my father is you've paid a highway patrol in Arkansas every Christmas so deliver cash my mother my mother who was black says that you are my father I looked like you I'm lighter skinned than my sister\nCan I please have some closure on this will you please take a DNA test either a ... a put this to rest of the show that it's not true or then to uh let me know that I've got a father and do and you know ... will come into the family and he was vilified\nVilified by the press there in that press conference especially by this reporter from the Daily Beast that she was so bad Alex you you remember that it was live streamed here on it for wars I at one point attacked\nInstead of talking to Danny waves that said how dare you treat him like this who are you I said I'm David I remember wars and she goes oh in Fort Worth and this is the Daily Beast shutting down one hand\nOn that ... expand their like how dare they may have more communicate because they want to be a whole lot about us and said we want violence and then we want to attack the press\nWell hey call from blowing up the White House wall Rosie O'Donnell call for the military and take crop out at the White House while they say hash tag a Republican hall they cannot Baron ... all hey say all of this insane crap they want to silence everywhere and then when you read and say it's a satire article not seen the video replay it later\nAnd he even joke about a satire article and make jokes they didn't misrepresent that were saying and we believe rep told her Ryan hang on that not only said that's not only did it 'cause like I said I say that there's Martian moon bedroom slate and tell her I've offered a million dollars isn't more miles\nFrom Star Trek is not real into health everybody knows that they'll probably say in fact the last time I didn't look like five years ago they said don't thinks letters that rail and depressed up like one on the show they think their own readers don't get that power the incredible mental illness [noise]\nOf what these people are doing and it just gets more and more and more insane David and again do you agree with me that ahead of the midterms they're planning something really really big but they're everywhere\nThey want to Taiwan everywhere and then when you read and say it's a satire article I've seen the video replay it later\nAnd he ain't joke about a satire article and make jokes they didn't misrepresent that were saying and we believe rep toy derived from that not only said that's not what we do 'cause like I said I say that there Martian moon bedroom light and tell her about what a million dollars or more miles\nFrom Star Trek this is not real into health everybody knows that they'll probably say in fact the last time I didn't look like five years ago they said don't think Leonard or rail and pressed up like one of the show I think their own readers don't get that power incredible mental illness\nOf what these people are doing and it just gets more and more and more insane David and\nAgain do you agree with me that ahead of the midterms they're planning something really really big but they're everywhere saying Trump's going to cause violence I here's one out here\nUh I'm just today there's just tons of each a shame that Trump's going to get a bunch of people killed Trump wants to media dead vox editor Trump hope to supporters will murdered journalist I mean it's just incredible they're the ones calling for violence David\nWell Alex you know they could be laying the foundation for that but let me tell you something they have overthrown our government and our foundation and our constitution and our individual rights if we allow them to get away with shutting down the free press and free speech free speech\nIs separate from the freedom of the press is bad enough to take away the freedom of the press for what they're doing it on social media is taking away the building of people\nTo read the press\nAnd then comment on what they agree with what they disagree with and that's what they're taking down and they understand that satire I I honestly don't think they're that stupid I honestly don't think the quarter is that ... they did it within a couple of hours of this\nNo they don't know what your frog David and again yeah Twitter is used more than telephone now in many areas or\nAs you know the head of Penn and teller came out and shed that it's more power from the courts now show they silences and then they demonize just connect the famous and we don't\nHave an way to respond back were post legal notices are challenged their lives and they are abusing their authority big checks out of control even the head of Google Now admits they're censoring people and says yeah we're helping China he told Congress in a letter last week censorship can help the government it's a good service were offering\nMhm yeah and we can use is outside of China as well and then we saw the good sense or document that was in a Breitbart saying that we're not going to follow\nThe model but has been the historically an America where we have a free market place of free speech we're going to follow the European idea that we're going to have dignity instead of liberty well that's not European idea really that's a BF Skinner a behavioral modification idea he wrote the book or\nA beyond freedom and dignity that's really where they're going they're trying to modify our behavior\nThat's right and they take your popular Twitter account down very genteel professional show you out and lie about you and say you believe space aliens runs ... and that a Hillary's really a rep joy and engage in fake news fraud against you when the silent shoe that use the criminal activity we're dealing with whether you're looking\nTo boost the benefits of our fish oil formula for just one an alternative painful wars life have the formula for you\nWhen she won that use the criminal activity we're dealing with\nWhether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula for just one an alternative painful wars why have the formula for years\nOr Babylon be quotes Hillary Clinton saying on an interview Sunday I'm happy to announce that I'm only half reptile I Hope my critics will think twice before calling me a space reptile now since I was only half true I'm only part blizzard person thank you very much well that's not the worst thing that's been set about Hillary Clinton\nThat would be a step up are actually\nThere be a reptilian space lizard\nShowing says it's satire he said it would be a step up for an updated and apologize hey we're satire sight but everybody's getting really upset about dish yeah people are now being banned for covering your satire and saying it's satire and then lying and saying you didn't say that to her\n[noise] but I never even satirical he said that there were Martian Colleen ... children on them\nThey just made it up and why not just that they can silence you Dan\nThey can say whatever they want about it that's the other question of censorship David he'll be back tomorrow where people can't censoring for now I Am to a lab and I am infowars dot com forward slash show\nAnd that's why it's so critical every ... ... email their friends and family daily and say first women to under attack here's what they don't want you didn't hear\nTax message friends and family are articles the live feed simple words that ... show works the pages we posted shape what the topic the topic is so people understand this she's urging they're trying to shut us down out of the election and only by listeners spreading the word signing up for a free newsletter and then sending that email on a\nAnd infowars dot com forward slash newsletter only by doing that when we get around the sensors David\nAlex and you know we're talking about DNA as I said before the serious question about DNA was shut down at that press conference by the Daily Beast or when daily daily Williams wanted to know if a Bill Clinton would take a DNA test to verify or to deny his fraternity but of course let's talk a little bit about the DNA of the Daily Beast\nOr it was just a few days ago that we pointed out\nThat the Chelsea Clinton's that's on the board of the company that owns the Daily Beast and she's been rewarded with six point six million dollars for doing so so I guess that makes a a Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton part of the DNA of the Daily Beast is their ancestors rather than the grandmother of the Daily Beast\nBut Alex I Want to say something about Twitter because you know we've had the situation with a\nA fair con coming out and saying uh Jews or he's not anti Semitic he's editor might then they said well that doesn't violate our rules because he didn't say that about a specific person they're saying that I violated the rules because I had targeted harassment of a specific person other words they'll re Clinton and you know being\nIt would take a DNA test to verify or to deny his fraternity but of course we'll talk a little bit about the DNA of the Daily Beast or it was just a few days ago that we pointed out\nThat the Chelsea Clinton sets on the board of the company that owns the daily basis then she's been rewarded with six point six million dollars for doing so so I guess that makes a a Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton part of the DNA of the Daily Beast is their ancestors show the parent and the grandmother of the Daily Beast\nBut Alex I Want to say something about Twitter because you know we've had the situation with a\nA fair con coming out and saying uh Jews or it's not anti Semitic he's the editor might then they said well that doesn't violate our rules because you didn't say that about a specific person they're saying that I violated the rules because I had targeted harassment of a specific person in other words Hillary Clinton and you know being a reptile\nLike figure they're not saying it's bullying traffic here she calls me a dark caught in the worst person in the world but yeah I I Can't say anything bad about her\nAnd she's serious about that but let me you know when we had this a statement this interview with wired magazine that Jack Dorsey had talking about Twitter CEO of Twitter and he said all that stuff about us being the free speech wing of the free speech party that was just a joke you know they become a joke themselves but they went on to say a lot of people come to Twitter they don't actually see an app or service\nThat kind of looks like it's a public square and they have the same sort of accept the expectations of a public square and that is what we have to make sure they get right also make sure that everyone feels safe and that public square so he uses the term public square three times when he testified before Congress to use the term public square five times Alex we have a Supreme Court decision\nThat says Nineteen forty six marshals Alabama that if you are in the public square even if it is privately owned that they can't stop your speech and the public square we've let a Supreme Court decision roe v Wade killed tens of millions of babies but we ignore this Supreme Court decision that would protect us from having the public square killed by\nJaw there's no doubt that they operate and they

an open ended loaded question I can go on and on and on I I I Love talking about the stuff you could have picked anything um\nAnd uh the\nMost important thing I Want people to understand is\nThat I have not found that stem cells alone will get rid of ... hardly at all maybe thirty percent like I said it's actually taken decompression and decompress seen on a table special table pulling water and nutrients and\nAnd the special wobble chair that re hydrate the desk and adjusting that we actually started getting the correction we're slowly over time that radical starts to diminish\nAnd starts to get functioning better so that you can get through your day hopefully without paying\nTaxes for us we just had a call from one of our listeners and another tough question there for a yeah she's talking about me oh you got a lot of knee pain how things go so it's not\nAlways there so we you know I Know you have to see here and all of that which I Want to remind everybody you've got another seminar coming up you know this Tuesday\nThirty yeah so oh and and if this young lady wants to come in a U.S has got to do is called six\nZero to nine nine to ... to six five six six zero two Ninety nine to two six five six she can actually get a complementary\nVisit with me where I ate all do a consultation find out what those goals are doing exam on that area and at least let her know if I can help or not if I Can't we'll find somebody who can but it's an interesting I have a great story of so recent if you look down at my left knee I have this thing on\nHere yes lie on it doesn't mean that let's say you can jump buildings\nYeah I'm looking forward to it I'm going to have to be models um [laughter] so you know this is a really good question because it comes and it goes to remember when you're sixty percent dysfunction of a nerve that's when you're going to get the sense that when it goes below that\nYou're not going to get the symptoms but it doesn't mean the problem is not there are some of my story I was looking forward to today and then we don't have much time\nBut six years ago I was in Tennessee and I was ...\nI was mountain biking by myself and it's a ten mile ride and if the remote areas so what I ended up doing was\nCrashing like three to four miles in\nAnd I thought I broke my leg and I didn't and I looked at it like oh it's just a human Selma yeah I Know this fancy word for like a blood blister right but it was really big on the inside of my legs just above my knee and my muscular but my ... my my leg good functioned it didn't hurt it just was kind of like an abrasion\nAnd I thought well what do I do go back or move forward well of course I rode the six to eight miles out in\nThe set by the time I was done I was black and blue all the way from the top of my leg down to a bottom of my cap I like I was really dumb\nAnd yep doctors who sometimes and so anyway so the last six years I just noticed that you know I had this sort of thing here and I have some lumps in there and I tried to get it out with some ultrasound do conservative things and I never really bother me\nCrashing like three to four miles in\nAnd I thought I broke my leg and I didn't and I looked at him like oh it's just a human Selma yeah I Know the the fancy word for like a blood bluster right but it was really big on the inside of my leg just above my knee and my muscular but my ... my my leg good function it didn't hurt it just was kind of like an abrasion\nAnd I thought well what do I do go back or move forward well\nOf course I rode the six to eight miles out in the set by the time I was done I was black and blue all the way from the top of my leg down to a bottom of my calf I'm like I was really dumb\nAnd yup doctors do sometimes and so anyway so the last six years I just noticed that you know I had this sort of in here and I have some lumps in there and I tried to get it out with some ultrasound do conservative things\nAnd I never really bothered me about two months ago my knee started bothering me I've never injured my knees in my life I've been into martial arts and wrestling and running and everything\nAbout two weeks ago I can hardly step up on a step on so it came in at when it came and went and I noticed it\nYou know here and there and I was like the typical person like maybe this young lady here and I thought well I can get through life it's OK\nI'll just continue to strengthen our go to the gym you ignore it would no I don't know is that I disagree with you on that one but I I knowledge did\nBut I didn't go to somebody that I should have and had proper extra inside an MRI done last Thursday okay found out I have three children muscles on the inside of my legs awful and the inside when there's 'cause we're starting to fray Mm I think that was because for six years my must be what your was out of balance and it started wearing on my desk is mhm so\nI'm not going to make you guess what I did in the next hour good [laughter] I called\n... and I said\nI Need to see these mhm and that ... afternoon Dr Miller actually be happened to be in the clinic doing injections of themselves and I had it injected then I put this knee brace on an oh my gosh to unload the inside of the need\nTo unload inside of the ... with the proper biomechanics and getting things taken care of correctly makes all the difference in the world so I Am a recipient for those that have knee problems\nPlays color called six zero to nine nine to two six five six come shake my hand in my clinic let me see what I can do to help you and let's get you fix stuff suffering yeah get your life back it's not necessary\nAnd I want to remind everybody again for the free workshop that Dr frost has coming up October twenty third next to stay at six thirty it's a again a free eventually you just come in and I asked\nThe doctor some great question and that is that one six six zero north fortieth street a sweet cheap too and I was at your clinic so it wasn't that far away you know are we are in my clinic I'd\nMuch rather be the next time that you're like in thirty seconds to say and also go to the region to region med dot com said\nThe region med dot com is my website please go there if you want to learn more about uh\nIn thirty seconds I was also an easy region if we can match dot com said\nThe region dot com it's my website please go there if you want to learn more about us\n'em or really really bad um hormonal acne or migraine\nSo a lot of hormonal I'm imbalances that are happening and what the Astros than does is it helps the body manage a lot of these I'm horrible to structures that were being exposed to 'em and it helps your body protest them a lot better help bring your hormones back into balance\nAnd um I I think that you know it's definitely an important thing to be doing\nFor um for women of all ages and I think if we can what I'm trying to do my practice is trying to educate the younger women especially you know when I see younger women coming in and they you know they have their hair died every six weeks and they get\nYou know their nails done then\nYou know eyelash extensions are really big right now\nI'm so if you think about how many chemicals just in that you know women are exposing themselves on top of you know makeup and body lotion and you know shampoos and ... and all those chemicals that works posing ourselves to so a lot of it is education on\nAvoidance you know and going to their local health food stores and trying to buy 'em you know natural I deodorant or natural makeup and there's some really really amazing clients that are out there now\n[noise] there are um yeah I Know I have a lot of people that come in and some people do what is this estrogen dominance thing you know yeah exactly you're talking a lot of us out here so [noise] yeah and yeah and he did with him so\nHad even with hormone testing like I Do a lot of hormone testing in my practice\nAnd I often see that estrogen dominance picture like too much estrogen versus projects drone um and so as I mentioned it can lead to a lot of those\nYou know most common women's health conditions that you know you're probably seeing in your store you know women that are coming in and they're like hairs thinning or they have like really really bad PMS or they you know have headaches every month and so they won't hormones are out of balance\nUm but they're not quite sure what to do about it [noise]\nMhm so which products would you recommend for a ... somebody in their mid fifties\nWho um are tired of going through a mental pause but yet still have their cycle every month which products because you know right now there\nAre again it's so it's a dream of which he um it's a can't sleep they're moody um they don't know what's going on with their bodies right now so what would you recommend\nJust around um and so as I mentioned it can lead to a lot of those\nYou know most common women's health conditions that you know you're probably seeing in your store you know women that are coming in and they're like hairs thinning or they have like really really bad PMS or they you know have headaches every month and so they won't hormones are out of balance\nUm but they're not quite sure what to do about it [noise]\nMhm so which products would you recommend for a ... somebody in their mid fifties who um are tired of going through a mental pause but yet still have their cycle every month which products because you know right now there\nAre again is so it's a dream of which he um it's a can't sleep very moody um they don't know what's going on with their bodies right now so what would you recommend a which products or would you recommend\nYeah so that's that's a really um that's a tough days because a lot of times those women\nAnd also I have to be mindful of you know I don't want to I don't want to recommend you know for patients due to lead and say okay here I Am you know like Fifteen pill that you need manager Perry metal ... and so\nOn one first and foremost I I always recommend the astro sense because they think that'll really helped to bring that protest drawback to balance and I think the theory\nIs is is women always think oh I'm going very menopause\nMy hormones must be like plummeting but that's not always the case a lot of women that are in that area matter puzzle face off in our estrogen dominant because their protest on levels have been declining ... for a long time prior to protest don't usually start declining when we're in our thirties\nAnd then you already started getting that estrogen dominance back then and then when we hit ... it's much more dramatic usually when we Manhattan ... usually that's in their fifth like late forties or fifties that's when estrogen eventually dropped off but that there's that whole preliminary\nStart where there's actually that estrogen dominance\nHappening so I usually will recommend the Astros and and then um we haven't talked a lot about the adrenal yet but\nI think a supporting Israel function is absolutely important to you and not prevent appalled will face to help prepare the body or amend applies the adrenal have a huge factor to helping the hormones stay healthy\nI'm especially that balance between ... and protests around helplessly help with energy how with um the will help your serotonin production and help with craving so that adrenal I'm a a adrenal support is really important as well\nAs a doctor um how do you identify adrenal fatigue\nYeah so there's a couple of different ways you can you can do 'em do that one\nWas in the ... the advantage of that I have worked in a clinical practice is that you know I'm spending an hour to an hour and a half with some of ... and doing held in because of her\nBut I Know I'm working I'm In my health food store and ... you only get a small I'm a small amount of time to chit chat with with your customers and so usually I I'm I look at like obvious signs and symptoms of adrenal fatigue um and one thing that I'm pretty sure you probably have\nOne or two of my books but you know there's the adrenal stress connection books that I co authored with Dr Karen Jensen a few years back and then I have my sense of women's health club which is the purple book and so in those books there's actually a little questionnaires on you know late your adrenal Strasser adrenal fatigue and I find that those are\nYou can do 'em do that one was in the ... the advantage of that I have worked in a clinical practice is that you know I'm spending an hour to an hour and a half was the ... and doing held in because of her\nBut I Know I'm working I'm In my health food store ... you only get a small I'm a small amount of time to chit chat with with your customers and so usually I I'm I look at like obvious signs and symptoms of adrenal fatigue um and one thing that I'm pretty sure you probably have\nOne or two of my books but you know there's the adrenal stress connection books that I co authored with Dr Karen Jensen a few years back and then I have like they can sense a women's health book which is the purple book\nAnd so in those books there's actually a little questionnaires on you know late your adrenal Strasser adrenal city and I find that those are great um [noise]\nUh resources for your customers and I always find that it's a great resource for my patients as well and I often you know\nSend them home with the questionnaire and I'll say you know fill this out and bring it back on the very next appointment divide probably the easiest way you know there are other for the house that you can have done there's cortisol testing that you could have done through saliva testing um that specifically\nLabs um so that's one another test there and testing that you can have done to you but I think probably the easiest way for\nUs to merge and people coming into the whole I Would be kind of look and watch the symbolic G and looking at the um the questionnaire\nGreat and and where can they find this questionnaire is it only in your book or can we find it on your website\n... that's a good question I just really did my whole website so I don't know if it's still on there um but I'll make a note to my Web designer that we should do a little blurb about having the questionnaire on there again\nUm but the books for sure and um yeah and so I'll I'll add that to on my list of things to do to add it to my website as well\n[laughter] that's another thing women like to do is that list to do [laughter] yeah I didn't lose hunger and longer so um I Want to talk a little bit too um ... you're right you know here on the floor and healthy habit we just have like five minutes to just assess\nReally quick of what's going on you know and if it is hormones or if it is a side Roy 'cause I Know right now everybody's on the high road medication and everybody's complaining to their doctors about you know hair falling now lack of sleep\nJust what's going on and I've just seen over and over you know what do you have for side right and I have to ask them you know the questions again and to make sure is it really sigh right\nBut as you were saying to with the hormones I mean it's cortisol it's adrenal it's your side writes this one is off it's totally from the other to correct what would you recommend\nThat you know absolutely nothing wrong connection between lower adrenal chronic stress affecting how the fire is going to her\nPerform at home mom with me all the ... case if somebody's coming in already ... with a preexisting low thyroid so they said on medication for you know ten plus years I'm ... and they're not taking any adrenal support that's\nOne of the first thing or you know the woman says okay nine times out of ten there is a call it was all snow um picture of it I'm buying like this one from\nA town poet of my customers soon as that triangle right is that what you're saying yeah OK yeah absolutely\nAnd civil that would be um\nRecognize that you know absolutely don't want the strong connection between low adrenal chronic stress affecting how the fire is going to her\nPerform at home mom with me a little\nTaste if somebody's coming in already ... with a preexisting low thyroid so they said on medication for you know ten plus years I'm ... and they're not taking any adrenal support\nThat one of the first ... ... you know the woman\nSays okay nine times out of ten there is a call goes oh no I'm picture that I'm lying on the phone from\nA town poet of my customers students that triangle right is that what you're saying yeah OK yeah absolutely\nAnd civil that would be um I don't know if we mentioned adrenal sense but that would be you know looking at the adrenal sense formula that you know it's been sort of a phased a adrenal formula my practice for years\nAnd then if they're like um [noise]\nThe the follow up a little bit extra help because sometimes you can you can provide support and the thyroid will just fall back on its owner will just start function and a lot better\nSometimes people will be the little a little extra thyroid support as well especially if they say hey you know what I've been taking Israel or ... years my I still feel like my I raised a little bit off\nThan I had the viral sense formula which essentially provides the body with all of the co factors um for a thyroid hormone production so we've got you know I ... and ... which is a really nice a synergistic Glen and we've got\nTired of the we've got actual gone does so we have a lot of the nutrients and the um [noise]\nYou know amino acids and or does that help the thyroid ... perform a lot better and help with that production of both I write hormones so it helps with that production a free T four and a free T three hormones\nOkay good so what you're saying also is you can take astro sense and you can take then I'm the I'm I'm a adrenal sense right and ... cents at the same time or what would you recommend\nAm I call today six to nine to three eight zero zero six to nine to three eight zero zero\nI'm Sorry because you're going to be great to block\nYou want to learn

program\nAnother study dealing with disparities among college he dealt with different is found in treatment and outcomes for head and neck cancer in men verses women\nThere's analysis of cancer registry data from a hospital system in California revealed that women with head and neck cancer or less likely to receive intensive chemotherapy and radiation when compared to men\nDefining from this study raises the possibility that women with head and neck cancer maybe under treated we interviewed jet cats all medical colleges at Kaiser Permanente in Santa Clara California who's a senior author

is from the Kaiser Permanente in California um\nStarted capital if I'm yet yesterday we were listening to some of the presentations given about having the concert\nTo moral Sunday there will be a more information about a ... and ... and some of the results that are are you had with a\nA gender disparities in in cancer especially this particular cancer but before we going to talk about that very particular if you are a patient if you are maybe not pitching yet\nUm and you're worried about some of the things that may lead up to a head and neck cancer some of the diagnostic things that\nSeemed to worry about some of the things people have to look at\nThank you very much Peter for this opportunity\nUm we're very excited about sharing our results that ... that year\nHead and neck cancer is a really important topic we know that the traditional risk factors for head and neck cancer are smoking and alcohol\nBut we also know that one of the emerging risk factors for head and neck cancer is each PV human papillomavirus\nWe previously did a study looking at demographic factors in northern California\nAnd we found that the rates the incidence rates for oral cavity cancer were fairly stable over time and I was looking between two thousand and two thousand and ten in a large population of patients in northern California\nHowever we found that the rate the incidence rate\nFor oral faring ... cancer that's like base of tongue cancer and console cancer was rising and that was had been seen in previous studies but those previous studies where mostly single institution studies\nOr smaller studies so we were the first to show that on a population level\nThat the rising incidence rate\nOf oral ... cancer um\nWhat was happening on a large population level and we know that that's related to this change in head and neck cancer related to age ... human papillomavirus\nHit our institution um it the rates of H. P. V. related head and neck cancer he's in the Seventy Seventy five percent range for newly diagnosed or all faring ...\nMeans patients that comes with a clinic an are newly diagnosed for the first time they they get a diagnosis of cancer that's correct\nUm if you um\nNow look at the people that are being diagnosed do patients that are coming in\nYou diagnose him I'm One of the things we learn also here during ask her what you said there was a difference I'm In um where they said to the to the different between women and men not only in being diagnosed but also we out comes with treatment\nCan you tell us a little bit about that absolutely\nThat was some of the results that we got from this current study and we were really\nUm it the rates of each PV related head and neck cancer he's in the Seventy Seventy five percent range for newly diagnosed or all faring ...\nMeans patients that comes with the clinic an are newly diagnosed for the first time they they get a diagnosis of cancer that's correct\nUm if you um now look at the people that are being diagnosed to patients that are coming in\nYou diagnose him I'm One of the things we learn also here during ask go is that there was a difference in um what is owed to the to the different between women and men not only in being diagnosed but also we out comes with treatment\nCan you tell us a little bit about that absolutely\nThat was some of the results that we got from this current study\nAnd we were really interested to look at patients in northern California to understand about intensive therapy a lot of the treatment for head and neck cancer can be very difficult treatment that can be very intensive and burdensome for patients\nSo we wanted to know if certain populations of patients would benefit from intensive therapy or if others would not benefit from intensive therapy so we look to this model\nWhich was a validated mathematical model\nCalled the generalized computing event model ... and we use this model or GCE model\nTo help us identify populations that are potentially under treated port over treated in clinical practice\nAnd when we apply this to our large population of head and neck cancer patients that were diagnosed between two thousand and two thousand and Fifteen we found\nSome interesting findings in particular um we presented our data here which is showing that women were more likely to die from head and neck cancer then from other causes\nWe also found that men were more likely to die from head and neck cancer than from other causes however when we compared\nWomen with men\nWe found that the ratio was nearly double for women compared with men so that means that in the school board a patient\nI'm On GCE analysis which meant troll for the stage of the cancer and the tumor location\nThat there was an increased risk for women to die from head and neck cancer then from other causes compared with men and this was a new finding and we we look forward to really investigating this further to fully understand this difference\nNow when you look at the difference and I mean there may be hypothesis which we say well this may be a reason you mentioned the fact that the treatment may be very intensive in some ways [noise] um he's got a region why maybe women may say well I prefer not to be treated or we have a slightly different approach to treatment\nThat's right so two things come to mind a to answer your question um one is that\nUm we looked specifically at treatments in our group we didn't not on the juicy analysis but on another thing called the logistic regression analysis looking at the types of treatment that patients received in in our cohort we did find\nThat less women received intensive chemotherapy and radiation therapy\nAnd to get to your question we really will need further investigation like a chart by chart review or prospective analysis to really understand why some patients may elect to have\nUm he's got a region why maybe women may say well I prefer not to be treated or we have a slightly different approach to treatment\nThat's right so two things come to mind a to answer your question um one is that\nUm we looked

our cohort we did find\nThat less women received intensive chemotherapy and radiation therapy\nAnd to get to your question we really will need further investigation like a chart by chart review or prospective analysis to really understand why some patients may elect to have or to decline aggressive and potentially burdensome treatments\nThe other thing which I think you were getting too as well um was on our GCE analysis so getting back to that finding that we had regarding the differences between survival for women compared with men\nThe model we used was designed to account for tumor location and stage but there was a statistically significant difference within our population that we should point out and that relates to the oral faring ... cancer kind of getting back to the TV right story we were talking about\nIn our group in our cohort patience the rate of ... cancer for women was thirty eight percent\nIn our cohort the rate of ... cancer for men was fifty five percent and that was due to sickly significant with the value of less than zero point zero zero one\nNow that is important and very interesting but just to finish that story and that's important because we know that HDTV related cancers most commonly occur in the oral Fairbanks and the tonsils and the base of town\nAnd we know that H. P. V. related head and neck cancer has a better prognosis and a better response to therapy\nSo what comes to mind when you are looking at H. P. V. I'm over the last decade theory is a\nIncreased emphasis on vaccination in case of cervical cancer in related to age ... before is that is a whole different set of cancer is nothing to do with this particular form of cancer\nBut dust that protects people in this particular case as well or you get too far fetched to say that if they are protected in one way or they may have diminished risk of getting a different form of cancer like head and neck cancer in this particular case\nIf it's not exactly what we studied in this trial but I Would say about vaccinations in general we're very hopeful that vaccinating both men and women boys and girls strike will help to prevent head and neck cancer in adults\nWould say about vaccinations in general we're very hopeful that vaccinating both men and women boys and girls right will help to prevent head and neck cancer in adult\nAnd I'm probably more importantly we saw that it delayed the time to needing chemotherapy which I think it's a very meaningful and point for women face the medicine ... cancer\nAnd we're starting to understand that as with any medication there are side effects and the side effects and so she would see decay for six inhibitors um include GI side effects such as diarrhea and Newt ... which is a low reign of the white blood cell count\nNow you have a background as a physician and now your vice president ... and the company also expanding the research and development team new hires from leading medical petitions\nSo in your own Kate how to having that first hand experience in treating patients and dealing with them and their families help you and your current role and how does your experience bring help to lily and developing better therapies and really putting the patient first when it comes to cancer [noise]\nWell I think it helped in a number of ways I think for me the way it helps me on a day to day basis is recognizing that our patients deserve and need better treatments\nAnd that's probably why you're seeing this large\nUm group of previously um academic physicians joining pharma not just slowly but other companies because what we see the potential to make a to build on our skill set that we've developed I took care of patients for twenty six years\nI understand what the unmet needs are I understand what delivering um quality care is and I understand what it really means to develop high impact medicine for people facing cancer\nAnd so are you know not just me but more declared Lena ... who have all recently joined Lilly or will be joining lily oncology along with our most senior leadership such as the bike airway\nWe all were in the trenches we all understood what a really good new drug was first since a drug that just kind of asked added very little it might have added something and not that remains I'm One of our foundational\nGoal that I carry with me as I joined lowly which is we want drugs that make a big impact they're not small but they're really game changing\nWhat the unmet needs are I understand what delivering on quality care is and I understand what it really means to develop high impact medicine for people facing cancer\nAnd so are you know not just me but Maher declared Lena ... who have all recently joined Lilly or will be joining lily oncology along with our most senior leadership such as the bike airway\nWe all were in the trenches we all understood what a really good new drug was versus a drug that just kind of at added very little it might have added something and not that remains I'm One of our foundational\nGoal that I carry with me as I joined lowly which is we want drugs that make a big impact they're not small but they're really game changing edits and that will make an impact for patients facing cancer\nEarlier this week we were actually invited to to an event organized by a company called ... portraits of resolve\nAnd I must say it was really impactful emotional look into um a patient's experience and the patient living with cancer and their thoughts and what goes through their head so how important is that it for you or the vice president and at the position to understand what patient living with cancer or going through [noise]\nWell it's super important to understand and bring that perspective to everyone network that lowly oncology that this is\nUm I don't know if that's translates very well but I I I used to say that's all the time my old ...

today that are getting these really high electric bills and heart goes from a PS ... heat 'cause atheists and that's where people had some dues or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake cutting let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nSecret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management and let me talk about that we see on our built this thing called demand and a lot of people an ape you this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe Thirteen point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rape plans selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hardest time of the day between three and eight PM and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest coming today oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were\nMe being Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hardest time of the day between three and eight PM and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest coming today oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\n... ... there's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it\nSo the smart energy management the way that you know gee the people like like that I've been told is remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your landline to call long distance\nMonday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay it a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were known more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends\nThey could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist met her when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when the hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatt there is actually what's called a demand charge that added on to our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars and forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it the power that you've consumed at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal\nUm I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] and I say the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay younger ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it it's a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS semester you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got\nUp about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay younger ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS semester you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you any more so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's gonna continue to go up\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them\nAnd I explain all this to them so not only are you paying between seven and a half and eat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying two words the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus the electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um\n... it just it doesn't make sense for them they can Ukrainian rates everybody should just call you just find out how to read\nTheir bill and then I don't know how to read they're real and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if he'll go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people will say that on my show all the time and say I do a rate\nI'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us\nThat have been hearing us for a year year and a half and then today there is out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time and then they go oh now I understand what she rains and so no judgments but at the end of the day we\nHave an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simply this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon\nYeah I Do a rate I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half and then today there's out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go oh now I understand what she rains and so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simply this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car\nAnd gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and pay two fifty and that's essentially Carol\nI'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS Messer piece rate punch today's rates [noise]\nWhen you added up the average home will you between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid the power company cut that in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money\nWell here's what we're gonna do we want to give out your phone number because every one really should just give recall she does a free consultation she's raised with the better Business Bureau I just found out at that out and uh her phone number direct it is six to three\nEight five zero eight two two nine she wants you to go up on her website it is ask solar Sandy dot com go to ask make sure it's at ... dot com\nFill out the kilowatt worksheet and she can help you save money on a bill that you're already paying way too much money on what are your final words for today you know\nIt it's the simplest is you know I really am on a mission and when I helped my daughter it was the first time in a long time due to my circumstances that I was able to do\nSomething really significant in her life 'cause I financially wasn't able to help her but I saw the really big problem for her and it gave me\nA self accomplishment in it she was so ever so grateful\nThen she shared it with her neighbors and a lot of her neighbors did it because the than I was able to help them understand my daughter was able to help them understand it\nSo now it's about I'm there to educate\nIt gives people the the information so that they can make an informed decision about their own power costs they wouldn't let somebody else choose their host what kind of payment they could afford for mortgage they wouldn't let somebody ... ... how much they could afford for car why would people\nUntil maybe they just haven't got the

solar Sandy dot com\nYou basically you don't have a choice that your power company\nBut you have a choice now because producing your own power at about between seven and eight cents per kilowatt\nIs a choice and you're going to put more of your hard earned money back in your own pocket in your ... your family's budget versus the power companies\nThe power companies you know I can see all kinds of things about the ... the power companies are there to make money and make a profit and they're going to make a lot of profit this year [noise]\nExcept if I have anything to do with it so I brought into de ... from families households that I've helped in recent months and if you can see this Carol how much does this person oh\nNegative two hundred and eighty four dollars and fifty seven seven because they they created Nineteen hundred and fifty dollars worth of their own power and they're going to get this isn't a PS customer of mine Michael aide who is going to get a check for over one thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars at the end of this year so you're\nNot only producing your own power between seven and eight cents now\nA PS is buying that extra power back in your roof is

today so far lot going on this week in Arizona a lot going on one thing that I have spoken about on my show is many of the propositions that are going\nOn here a few weeks ago a couple of weeks ago we had Andrew Clark with of Americans for prosperity on and we were talking about proposition one twenty six where we need you to vote no\nBarely touched on started to touch on proposition one twenty seven\nUm guess what it's another no [laughter]\nAnd I want Andrew to come back on and tell you all about it so I guess what he's here Andrew thank you for joining us again [noise]\nUm\nI Know a little bit more about one twenty seven than one twenty six and but but since I think you know even more to do and I hope you do but it's real basic some\nReally basic the bottom line is\nEven one twenty seven it was a good idea meaning that it was really going to help us out in some way shape or form a\nWe we couldn't afford it for one into it is just going to make things worse and it's got to be the most the craziest villain I think I've seen out there where it's going to cost the taxpayers more money and for people are saying it's going to help\nThe environment it's going to harm the environment and I want you to explain to people why this is just a blatant out now live by the people that are supportive as crazy proposition but explain the proposition that explained why they were just so out in left field on us\n\n[noise]\nShape or form a\nWe we couldn't afford it for one into it is just going to make things worse than it's got to be the most the craziest bill that I think I've seen out their words it's going to cost the taxpayers more money and\nFor people who are saying it's going to help\nThe environment it's going to harm the environment and I want you to explain to people why\nThis is just a boiling out now live by the people that are supportive as crazy proposition but explain the proposition that explained why they were just so out in left field on us\nYeah there are some areas of is a bad idea that kind of hard to get them onto sites argument but let's start with the big picture which is that they want an alternative state constitution and\nSo in a way and it would force the utility companies here to provide at least fifty percent of the power they have in the grid from essentially for solar\nIt'll save all solar and wind or ... percent renewables outlaws hydro a nuclear to be classified as renewable so early saying ... percent of our power needs to be provided\nBy solar and when you hear them make the argument talk radio or they're almost exclusively talking about solar and\nSolar energy is for him to the utility companies just refused to adopt to solar because failure green and\nThey want to make money off of calls [noise] um [noise] which isn't true at all and so when you talk a little bit about why any money for the consumers can talk about why it's bad philosophical idea to use the constitution to\nProtect special interest groups are in this case promote solar ... I'm ... and of course and also talk about why\nThe utility system is just bad in the way it's set up today anyways and why this is just so start wherever you want to\nWell ah for for one what I'd like to do is I'd like to talk about what it'll do to the nuclear power plant which by the way folks is the safest energy we have out there we haven't built in nuclear power plant in the United states and the\nI guess late seventies it was early age but it's been about Thirty years or so ... almost ... it's it's it's insane to me because it has been proven to be the safest energy source that we have out there and folks solar is not there yet do I do I have a problem with the idea\nOf solar energy no not at all but one technology is not there\nAnd when they're going to try to shut down perfectly safe perfectly well working facilities worth thousands of people are employed where's millions of dollars I think it's over sixty million dollars a year we get for our classrooms\nFrom uh these these these energy sources you try to shut them down and then create solar power in order to do this you will have to create what was it they said they had to creating your Andrew I Believe they had the great at least two factories\nWhich are gonna be cool burning or fuel burning in order to create the solar right\nYeah yeah I mean depending on what kind of solar they want to use um [noise] and this is part of the ... as I said the technologies involving rapidly and they're not even sure what kind of technology they want to use on this and so if they do like to have right now the largest solar plant in the state of the solar plant called salon and\nIt does use a natural gas to fire up the molten salt they use to capture me solar energy west today so in a non carbon neutral or negative decline\nBurning or fuel burning in order to create the solar right\nYeah yeah I mean depending on what kind of solar they want to use um [noise] and this is part of the screen is set to technologies involving rapidly and they're not even sure what kind of technology they want to use on this and so if they do like to have right now the largest solar plant in the state of the solar plant called salon and\nIt does use a natural gas to fire up the molten salt they use to capture the solar energy west today so in a non carbon neutral or negative decline", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Cave Creek", "day": "20"}
