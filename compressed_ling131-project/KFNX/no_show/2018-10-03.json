beginning of chapter five\nThe essential question a nation that's been forced to ask over and over is who is pulling the strings and why why are why is this happening well let's look at a real war against women\nAnd you have to look at the real war against women that as being conducted by those who claim to be protecting women\nSo we go back to the Salem witch trials and the hysteria against which is in Salem region was from in the environment of economic uh socio political turmoil does it sound familiar\nWell it'll be familiar to you after you investigate this a little a little bit more so what was what were the Salem witch trials what happened\nWell the minister of Salem Village was the strict pious Reverend Samuel Paris and he had a son Thomas and two daughters ages eleven at night in January of sixteen Ninety to the girls began having tantrums or fit as they were called at the time\nOr the girls through objects screen made strange noises and twisted themselves into bizarre positions\nAs with John good when the children in Connecticut\nAnd Dr was called and once again unable to cure the girls the physician pronounce the element to be demonic in nature well then another

pressure of the girls identified three women Sarah Osborne an elderly woman living in poverty Sarah Good a pregnant beg a woman and the parishes Caribbean slave YouTube\nConveniently unpredictably two of them were among the rabble into that authorities did not want in their town good an Osborn profess their innocence to no avail and so\nObjects screen ... strange noises and twisted themselves into

another local girl eleven year old and putting them began having in a similar fashion a pair of magistrates are demanded that the young lady's name the source of there'll be which meant\nOn February twenty ninth under pressure of the girls identified three women Sarah Osborne an elderly woman living in poverty Sarah Good a pregnant beg a woman and the Paracels Caribbean slave YouTube\nConveniently unpredictably two of them were among the rabble into that authorities did that one in their town good an Osborn profess their innocence to no avail and so did they do but at first\nThose slaves were rare in the region she had been with Reverend Paris for fourteen years and she loved the Paris children for whom she was largely responsible but Paris whipped er into confessing\nPromising to secure her released if she did do the poor woman admitted to the magistrates that quote the devil came to me and bid me serve him an added that she was not the only local which wanting to harm the Puritans you also inform them that she had in fact bake they which cake\nFrom Ryan urine with what she gave the family dog just in case the pet was a familiar or help her of a local which what happened next [noise]\nThe three women wore a prison the next day\nDespite its promise perished vow to political expediency and allowed the slave to remain behind bars we late spring before the governor finally convened the special court order and permanent as soon as the women were in prison the Salem authorities other took a program we know all too well the art of distraction pay attention Diane\nIf there were problems between the merchants and farmers if there were challenges to the local theocracy then leaders must create a diversion Diane an event that would dominate what passed for a new cycle and sixteen Ninety two and that was which is right in their midst to Juba had said there were others the word spread that they had to be found\nUsing a tactic some Dianne Feinstein and the committee\nTactics or mass hysteria and paranoia Europe had purged itself of tens of thousands of undesirable that way Salem and it's on her own had to do the same\nAs with so many things one can hold the media partly responsible for this hysteria and I give you some examples of how the media was used in that time through books and publications\nAnd so the hysteria gathered force throughout the early spring and the numbers of those accused continue to grow by the end of may more than sixty people were jailed and awaiting trial for witchcraft\nThat was when the governor was finally forced to establish a special court of all your and Terminator and what happened then on June tenth that institution Dianne Feinstein hang its first victim Bridget Bishop\nA brash the widows late husband had run and then she was apparently accused of no crime in particular other than that she was a soft target\nThe woman who was known for playing shuffle board and wearing red clothing which was considered to signify sexual yearning prowess well it went on and on and on and what happened\nWell cotton mayor put his agenda ahead of justice she crafted the equivalent of fake news who contributed his own call to arms that the court riding the following\nWe cannot but humbly recommend onto the government the speeding and vigorous prosecution of such as we have rented themselves obnoxious according to the direction given in laws have gone and the wholesome statutes of the English nation for the detection of witchcraft\nAnd so what happened was at the peak of the hysteria few citizens regardless of their standing\nBridget Bishop a brash the widows late husband had run and then she was apparently accused of no crime in particular other than that she was a soft

another under the Salem witch trials\nAnd so now we speed forward to today\nAnd I'm reading from a book that I'm show will become a very popular book in America for many years to come stop mass hysteria\nI Want to make one important point and that's one that you're going to face today and for the next months and years ahead and that's the difference between mass hysteria unjustified concern\nIf for example the public had risen up against cutting them either and his cohorts that would not have been a stereo in twenty eight team this is something the mainstream media did not understand\nIf you look back through history history not agenda masquerading as history which is all you get from the media today you would learn that the following\nThat for the last one thousand four hundred years radical Islam has been at war with the world that is not a slam a phobia as the mainstream media would have you believe it is fact it is history and I urge you to read this without the bias I mentioned earlier in this book indoctrination versus truth\nAnd I give you a list going back only forty years for a partial lifting of the atrocities going back to Nineteen Seventy nine and the U.S embassy in Iran was taken over by radical Muslim males and I bring this up because the mass hysteria in our society is running in the opposite direction as well and what do I mean by that\nNone in the media will dare call it by its proper name\nNot in the media will reference nine eleven it's proper context none in the media will recognize that we are still at war and had been at

beings behind we could leave them behind you have the power when I see a decent man and his family destroyed all this\nI realized that anybody can be destroyed in this country by the Feinstein gang this gang of commerce ours are doing to cabinet what was done in the Soviet Union what was done in Hitler's Germany\nAnd denouncing some on your destroyed that person there was no trial there was no trial necessary or you did was denounced the person and they were ruined\nThese are the tactics of the Nazis in Germany and the Soviets in Russia I used to think we're a nation of laws and that with that from a nation that libel laws you couldn't get away with this but then I woke up and found out that senators are above the law movies have been done about them\nBooks have been written about this kind of corruption remember I wrote a novel called abusive power set in San Francisco it was a New York times best selling you wouldn't know it would you call it abuse of power jak Hatfield was my character\nSo this is an old story kind of information and smear campaign and what's ironic here is that the left which was belly aching for forty years about McCarthyism and McCarthy on now actually worse than senator McCarthy ever was at its height\nBecause as I point out and stop mass hysteria McCarthy was actually right when he accused all of those members of Hollywood and the media\nAnd academia of working with the Soviet Union he was denounced as a crackpot even though he had been a war hero they made a mockery of show you how smart the left is they took senator McCarthy who had been a tail gunner in World War two one of the most dangerous of all positions\nSet in San Francisco it was a New York times best seller you wouldn't know it would you call it abuse of power jak Hatfield was my character\nSo this is an old story kind of information and smear campaign and what's ironic here is that the left which was belly aching for forty years about McCarthyism and McCarthy on now actually worse than senator McCarthy ever was at its height\nBecause as I point out and stop mass hysteria McCarthy was actually right when he accused all of those members of Hollywood and the media\nAnd academia of working with the Soviet Union he was denounced as a crackpot even though he had been a war hero they made a mockery of show you how smart the left is they took senator McCarthy who had been a tail gunner in World War two one of the most dangerous of all positions\nThink of it a glass bubble in the back of a bomber with machine guns facing enemy fighters he survived all of that came out a war hero became a U.S senator\nThe vermin on the left called them tail gunner Joe was if that was something to mock rather than salute but that was just the beginning they said he was a drunk they said he made it all up well they destroyed them and he died a hopelessly broken man\nWhat they did to McCarthy is what they're doing to cabinet or and\nThen you want to get to the way of the left wing failing that has destroyed America over the last fifty years now we had an election and we put Donald Trump in power we stopped there juggernaut and they're fighting to turn it around with every one of his major appointments make no mistake about it\nIs really a mandate on you I've said this you'll be four by marrying cabin or their smearing you you could be a black transsexual a woman in Berkeley and you're being smeared if you voted for Trump do you understand that you understand how this works you understand that marrying you by marrying him\nAnd it's just the beginning and so the only thing we can do is fight back and again I say with the keyboard and a little native intelligence you can probably uncover things about the senators that might just have them running back onto the rocks that they crawled out of the stores that they live in\nBecause the Internet as a very powerful tool there's a lot of lives on it\nBut somewhere in the midst of the lives there may be some nuggets of gold and I invite you the listeners to become the detectives to turn on the committee members who have done this to a decent man I have never in my life seen anything like this never but again getting back to what McCarthy\nAnd the McCarthyism that the left you still want us about just for a moment\n... years later there was a publication and titled of an owner papers V. E. N. O. N. A. R. wrote about it and one of my previous books\nAnd the va noted papers were written by former KGB agents and they disclose that in fact all of the people named in the committees and the hearings in the fifties by McCarthy Warren fact Soviet operatives or Soviet fellow travelers every last one of them was guilty\nAnd so here we are now watching the equivalent of the quote McCarthyism were warned

absolutely okay so in the backdrop of the valley are there any numbers out there I mean it is like one in three people have pets any idea and\nI Am not specifically don't know the numbers in the valley but just from what I've seen with people walking around every day I Would venture to say that if you talk to nine out of ten people in the restaurant they have a pet of some sort either a dog or cat or something of that nature so a lot of people do have them\nAll right tell us some specifics here we've got about five maybe six minutes left give me some specifics here now families that have dogs what are you got for dogs\nWell we've got our a meal seasonings we have a variety of different flavors we have these chicken chicken liver turkey or salmon a ocean fish duct my dog loved the duck and wood duck Colorado [laughter]\nOr a quarter of the dog the look on her face is like I'm not eating the food until you sprinkle it on there or is it the conduct\n... possibly both are so the what the product or just it's great for dogs or cats that maybe don't want to eat the same thing every day you know we as people don't like to eat the same thing every day and really either do your pets\nSo our group of the veterinarians who put together a formulation of vitamins minerals or fruits and vegetables and different seasonings so that your dogs if you're not able to afford maybe the the higher end quality dog foods you could afford the seasonings and know that your pets are getting\nThe vitamins and nutrients and minerals that they need to have from their food\nIt's very simple

had just a little lump in the uh\nThroat there for the technical glitch and I apologize for that but let's go right into it you're the Republican mayoral candidate for Phoenix and we'd like to hear from you on our show about how it is\nA good for families good for everyone in Phoenix to have you as Mary [noise]\nFirst of all I think it's important for your listeners to know that the local races like your school board races your city council races and even the mayor's race they're considered non partisan races that when people look at our names on the ballot there won't be a Republican or Democrat or an L. or an eye on any of the ballot\nI'm I Am a registered Republican so that's true I'm also an immigrant or and or Ronald Reagan was the inspiration for my family to come from Panama to the United states when I was five years old and so the two questions I get asked most often on the campaign trail\nOr one with my party affiliation\nAnd I'm a Republican and to an MIT legal citizen [laughter] well yes and the answer is yes and yes that's correct and and you know this campaign has been a really about\nA bringing city hall back to the residents of Phoenix you know I feel like um we have Fifteen urban villages in the city of Phoenix\nAnd city hall has really focused on one urban village and that's the downtown a court or and they really ignores the other fourteen villages surrounding areas throughout the city\nFamilies don't feel like they've been represented when it comes to the important issues the local issues that really affect them like public safety infrastructure your streets roads and quality of life issues but they're they're your public pools public libraries homelessness those are all things that I've highlighted on my\nAnd I'm a Republican and to a MIT illegal citizen [laughter] [noise] well I guess\nAnd the answer is yes and yes\nThat's correct and and you know this campaign has been a really about\nA bringing city hall back to the residents of Phoenix you know I feel like um we have Fifteen urban villages in the city of Phoenix\nAnd city hall is really focused on one urban village and that's the downtown a court or and they really ignored the other fourteen villages surrounding areas throughout the city\nFamilies don't feel like they've been represented when it comes to the important issues the local issues that really affect them like public safety infrastructure your streets roads and quality of life issues but they're they're your public pools public libraries homelessness those are all things that I've highlighted on my campaign those are the things that I'm running on and\nNow and that's why I feel like uh my vision for the city of Phoenix is going to be one that resonates with voters\nAnd just for the record is sunny slope still one of the fourteen villages\nThat's right there's ... there's west any slope moon valley um there's\nA year neighborhood right there is a is a critical part a homelessness is something that gets brought up often when I go canvassing in your neighborhood when I talk to business owners or we're always talking about homelessness that's the that's the key issue though that an infrastructure so your streets you wrote just by rocks and your parks\nYeah that's a huge issue here we have a lot of rangers city finished rangers come here for the morning coffee and has something to eat some of the six hundred precinct first squad police officers are here on a daily basis\nWe hear a lot of anecdotal evidence that sunny slope\nHad been forgotten in many ways that you've already brought up how does that mayor of Phoenix regardless of who you might be or she might be how do we address this particular area which seems to be such a sore spot on Phoenix itself\nFor the first thing you're going to need is you're gonna need the mayor to be a leader I mean leadership is something that we've all black at city hall for so long\nOr someone to to really bring in a clear vision and and bring a coalition of people to work together on one mission one fight and and I have\nA long history in a background and experience in leadership positions I have spent as you said earlier the last twenty two years in the United States Navy for those years were active duty years one tour in Afghanistan and often the missions that you or I or other veterans are involved in\nAnd sometimes be complex and high level mission and all of our leaders have always stressed that we can't complete these high level missions are these complex missions if we're not brilliant at the base things\nAgain city hall seems to have forgotten or its core services and the basic services that they should be providing they're trying to implement complex missions and complex special projects\nIn size ... the next mayor I plan on bringing my leadership abilities and communication skills to city hall and get us all focused on being brilliant at the base that's\nWell that's a great place to start one of the things that Bruce Nixon like charities\nFocuses on particularly here in our own neighborhood is\nEnsuring a human first policy so many times I Know you've read it we've seen it on the next door apps we've seen it from people who are angry at aggressive panhandlers in the street who seems to be\nA high level of annoyance with people who are perceived to be on the street by their own accord whether it be for drugs or\nSix services that they should be providing they're trying to implement complex missions and complex special projects and seismic the next mayor I plan on bringing my leadership abilities and communication skills to city hall and get us all focused on being brilliant at the base that's\nWell that's a great place to start one of the things that Bruce Nixon like charities\nFocuses on particularly here in our own neighborhood is\nEnsuring a human first policy so many times I Know you've read it we've seen it on the next door apps we've seen it from people who are angry at aggressive panhandlers in the street who seems to be\nA high level of annoyance with people who are perceived to be on the street by their own accord whether it be for drugs or alcohol or just\nTrends is the ... in general\nIs there a way for the city to promote\nThis idea that at the core of all these issues we're dealing with human beings\nYes I'm actually you see that often in the nonprofit organization in our valley we have a lot of great non profit work are out there and they stress the dignity of human dignity of your neighbors\nUm I have a a really well detailed plan on how to address this complex problem on my website ah Moses Sanchez dot com and if you just click on homelessness and poverty you'll see some of the issues that uh some of our smart solutions to these problems but\nWhat I think a lot of people don't realize in Phoenix is that we are number two in the country when it comes to extreme poverty\nWe're number one in the country uh interventions and what people don't realize is\nWhen an addiction gets on your record is on there for quite some time and so being that we're number two in the country and extreme poverty there's a lot of families out there or just one bad month away\nA from being on the streets and and and this this is just we occurring problem that you're going to have so it's not always do your behavior a health problem it's not always drug abuse and alcohol there's there's quite a lot of people out there who just had a really bad mom and and they end up on the streets and we need to address that we need to talk about it\nYou know that's really great point you bring up if you're just tuning in this is Bruce Nixon show we're on the phone via radio or vice versa with Moses Sanchez the mayoral candidate\nAnd we're trying to get to the bottom of this issue of human dignity particularly here in sunny slope the village where we reside in the life of coffee studios\nAnd Moses in fairness you and I talked to earlier and we really had similar ideas but\nOne of the things that we advocate for here Bruce Nixon like charities is for more non profit to be involved in the mix than the government\nIt's my position and I believe you have a similar position that we the people have a personal responsibility to care for our neighbors\nAnd that the government can't really do a great job of doing that\nAnd I would advocate for more nonprofits working harder on their own outside of government taxes ... whatever you want to call it maybe you can expand on this thought I just think that we the people can do a better job\nBut yeah I I I again it's one of the things that I listed on my website uh with regards to to non profit work\nOften find especially here in the city of Phoenix that they didn't get in the way a lot of the the great nonprofits of our valley when when I talk to places like Phoenix rescue mission circle the steady Andres house\nPosition and I believe you have a similar position that we the people have a personal responsibility to care for our neighbors and that the government can't really do a great job of doing that\nAnd I would advocate\nFor more nonprofits working harder on their own outside of government taxes levees whatever you want to call it maybe you can expand on this thought I just think that we the people can do a better job\nWell yeah I I I again it's one of the things that I listed on my website uh with regards to to non profit work we\nOften find especially here in the city of Phoenix that the city gets in the way a lot of the the great non profits of our valley when when I talk to places like Phoenix rescue mission circle the steady Andres house on some of these folks do radical work I just did a ribbon cutting I was\nHonored to have participated I'm at a ribbon cutting ceremony this past Saturday for a tiny homes project for veterans tiny homes for veterans project now this project is an affordable housing units\nFor a veteran and they built three houses two hundred and eighty eight square feet and when you talk to the developer who built this\nUh Elizabeth single can just go away part is that this is her when she ate for that and you ask her how many of these can you Bill I mean that but the project itself uplift the community it in and she says we have the capital we have the resources we have the labor we can build more\nIt'll take a thirty day but she has a problem\nFor this first set of tiny homes that they built\nThe city of Phoenix and the permitting process it took two years that two on who you're talking about\nThat is honest and we hear stories like this every day throughout the city where non profit organization have to go through a lot of bureaucracy and red tape in order to provide services to those most in the\nWe the city is job is not to fix these problems but we shouldn't be over regulating we should be enabling these organizations to do their work\nWe have another issue here that I Want to drill down on just for a moment I don't know if there's an answer but I Do know that between twelfth street in nineteenth avenue there are some Fifteen vocational and chemical rehabilitation centers\nNext week standby we're going to have another candidate on the program\nMaybe even some big names from the national spotlight working on some of those angles for you

the Feinstein is now McCarthy\nOnly there's no truth or allegations we see that\nEvery one of them on the committee or the new Soviet and I am only hoping that the fairness of the American people\nWill shine through all of this mark and that Kavanaugh will be voted upon and approved however I Am not optimistic that will happen because I did some research on who Senator Flake is\nAnd you'll be shocked to find out\nThat Senator Flake well appearing to be somewhat middle of the road is anything but\nI think this like will vote against him no matter what the FBI says now remember

what happened was at the peak of the hysteria few citizens regardless of their standing were immune from accusation and they went on they got one person after another under the Salem witch trials\nAnd so now we speed forward to today\nAnd I'm reading from a book that I'm sure will become a very popular book in America for many years become stop mass hysteria\nI Want to make one important point\nThat's one that you're going to face today and for the next months and years ahead\nAnd that's the difference between mass hysteria unjustified concerned\nIf for example the public had risen up against caught in a major and his cohorts is that would not have been hysteria\nAnd twenty eight teams or something the mainstream media did not understand if you look back through history history not agenda masquerading as history which is already get from the media today you always learn that the following\nThat for the last one thousand four hundred years radical Islam has been at war with the world\nThat is not a slam a phobia as the mainstream media would have you believe\nIt is fact it is history and urge you to read this without the bias I mentioned earlier in this book indoctrination versus truth and I gave you a list going back only forty years for a partial lifting of the atrocities going back to Nineteen Seventy nine and the U.S embassy in Iran was taken over by\nRadical Muslim

twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nIf you cannot seduce them with promises a free things and mass hysteria about the other guys you have to take another attack\nYou have to do there which tell them that that means is okay it's harmless it's fine and what I'm Talking about today is marijuana remember for many many years of marijuana was seen as the evil drugs the most evil drug of all and we were subjected to a form of mass\nBrainwashing about the dangers of marijuana but today the exact opposite\nIs being promulgated which is that marijuana is the miracle cure for everything from ... cancer fallen arches arthritis romanticism runny noses run a year's runny eyes depression it to the sanity a form of mass hysteria\nThat is used to drug the youth\nIn order to manipulate them into following the orders of the left\nSo we're living through the new Soviet era in America being promulgated by the Feinstein committee I call it that because she is the senior she keeps saying she's the senior member of the community or she knows the libel and slander law is in America\nShe knows that there's a difference between libel and slander she knows a defamation can destroy a person forever and yet they're engaging in a form of defamation I have not seen in my entire lifetime in America as an American citizen\nAnd more particularly in the twenty five years I've been in the radio business and there's an author I have never seen such unmitigated\nA defamation as I'm seeing against Kavanaugh right now\nNow I spent a little time talking about the Salem witch trials from my forthcoming book

example of a corporate example\nThe contaminated Coca Cola scare of Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd that began in Ninety nine when more than a hundred students in Belgium reportedly fell ill after drinking the beverage\nWhile the subsequent investigation coupled with some inept PR handling cost Coca Cola a cool two hundred million dollars and several they ban in other European countries and while

I'm Glad to take your phone calls and emails in just a moment I started out with the president's comments that were in a terrible spot today where a man and it primarily applies to men although you could easily see the same kinds of scandal involving women but that a man is accused and if he's accused he's guilty\nUntil he proved himself innocent that's been the gist of the cabinet investigation from the beginning of this which you'll remember I'll point out started at what was supposed to ban\nThe end of all of the hearings into confirming him as a Supreme Court justice offering gap and he joins me now who's the founder and president of the center for security policy and Frank is a little outside of what we usually talk about here but uh but I Want to know\nDo we know which FBI's investigating Kavanaugh is this the corrupt one\nThat had to have a ... a number of people like call me and McCabe and others fired or is this one that can actually turn around a a good solid investigation and quiet some of these democratic protest\nWell I don't think anything's gonna\nSell as the Democratic process 'cause this is all about his record this is about uh what he would do on the porch yeah\nThey're determined to wedge political warfare against until they destroy it ended I of course the state of the court of law floors I I don't know the answer that question I I think it's a tremendously of port what we\nHave a reason to believe that the guys who would be doing the investigation\nOf the charges would be you know drawn from the large ranks of\nPatriotic law\nEnforcing the law abiding FBI agents\nThe trouble is that I'm quite certain\nThat there are among the ranks of the leadership of the FBI still people like putting the caves and like the Kobe's

abiding FBI agents\nThe trouble is that I'm quite certain that there are among the ranks of the leadership of the FBI still people like putting the caves and likes to call me is unlikely pages and

to take it as a gift and that they'll do whatever they can\nBecause this is part of the counter state it's not just deep say truthfully hits like counter state and they are as in bed at the end is determined to defeat Donald\nTrump and his presidency is\nAny of those Democrats on the Judiciary Committee or elsewhere in the Senate or for that matter you know that the resist and anti tapes I'm afraid\nWell here's what I'm thinking about Frank because one of the questions of because we have this\nPress corps that is just dead set against from what they never considered is that we have three branches of government you know judicial legislative and executive judicial is you know they were considering coming off of that the legislative branch because\nOf the insistence of Jeff Flake has said we want the executive branch the FBI which is under the executive branch to investigate this even though\nThe legislative branch has its own resources to do this I I Know that people maybe haven't thought of this but the Senate Judiciary committee has a huge staff of people who are professional investigators and who have the expertise to do the very same thing that the FBI is doing\nExcept I Wonder whether the Democrats no we've got some deep stayed friends over in the FBI who as you said are still there and they're still willing to carry water for us and we'll produce the result we won\nInstead of the result they might get\nFrom the ... from the Congress his own investigators who are perfectly\nCapable of looking into this because all the FBI is doing right now for the most part is interviewing people and asking questions well there are people on the Senate Judiciary committee staff who could be doing that too and it would be directly under the control of Congress although it would be under the control of a Republican Congress\nRight well that's the rub isn't it you know I had an interesting conversation today with a cell by the jak cash show who you were in Denver I chose a you interviewed back when he published a book about TWA eight hundred wish exposed what\nThe corruption that the FBI and the CIA during the Clinton Administration meant in terms of essentially covering up what actually happened taking down that flight accidentally or but it was devastating effect and you put into the next um\nI think the well the\nManipulation and abuse of a couple of other investigations Oklahoma City being one you have\nA of course the Clinton Hillary Clinton email scandal thing another and and this most recent one more solar celebrates\nCash show who you are in Denver I chose a you interviewed back when he published a book about TWA eight hundred wish exposed what\nThe corruption that the FBI and the CIA during the Clinton Administration meant in terms of essentially covering up\nWhat actually happened taking down that flight a accidentally but with devastating effect and you put into the next um I think the well the manipulation\nAnd abuse of a couple of other investigations Oklahoma City being one you have\nA of course the Clinton Hillary Clinton email scandal thing another and and this most recent one more solar celebrating barking I should say the\nAnniversary of in this week and that is the Las Vegas shooting I think all of these have been instances where people in leadership in the FBI did\nManipulate and and corrupt\nThe work of that organization which is needed by our country\nUm and unfortunately has damaged the reputation of the whole enterprise as a result of what these guys have done so I think that was operating for some Democrats it's kind of amazing to me that it wasn't a concern to Republicans given what we've been watching play out here while I was just one of those scandals with those recent one Hillary's\nAnd think about this Frank I mean I think this is relevant they missed the pulse nightclub and I won't even have the whole is 'cause I'm doing this for memory they missed on may lose crews have Parkland, Florida\nThe up probably high you know I understand there are good people who work there I Know some people who work at the FBI the lower ranks in the region ranks I Do too that agency as an agency even at the local\nField office in say Florida\nHas screwed up and we've seen these screw ups and we've documented number of the screw ups where we've watched in real time as their screw up led to literally dead bodies in American cities and then we said we can trust them to do a competent job of investigating something that seems well\nThe the longer that goes on since last week since last Thursday the more we seem to be seeing this\nStory fall apart a Julie sweat story is falling apart the W ... story is falling apart and even a a Christine Cooke story is falling apart and yet still forward we've got an agency that has occasionally produced a you know bad results or no result for political results doing the investigation\nThat you know human I've talked about this a lot over the years bars but one other piece of this which again I think is a function of bad leadership has been\nUm the fact that lots of these agents good people most of them I Would argue it stipulate that virtually all of them are good people that feels level people\nBut they've been denied training about the nature of the enemy that we're facing a specifically the ... the premises that's been for boat since Bob lower demand now\nMost closely associated with this a witch hunt against President Trump but we'll recall before\nWas the director of the FBI and he said\nWe're not going to have people training in a way that would offend a Islam or Muslim and so these are the kinds of issues that have caused people that I admire greatly a fellow particularly I'm sure you know Chris feral yep\nOf judicial watches said listen we need to start over you know they suggest using the U.S marshals office says the sort of\nA nucleus of a new federal\nPeople that feels level people but they've been denied training about the nature of the enemy that we're facing a specifically the ... the premises that's been your boat\nJust bubble or the man now most closely associated with this a witch hunt against President Trump but we all look all\nThese four was the director of the FBI and he said we're not going to have people training in a way that would offend a Islam or Muslim and so these are the kinds of issues that have caused people that I admire greatly a fella particularly uh I'm sure you know Chris feral yup\nOf judicial watch is that what we need to start over you know the AIDS suggests using the U.S marshals office says the sort of\nA nucleus of a new Federal Bureau of investigation but basically a rift this went up by the roots and start over and I looked great believer that we need the capability but we may neither do I\nIf the Democrats get their ... and that is to push the confirmation of cabinet off to the election and if they pick up a seat or two in the Senate\nThan they have already vowed that they will not approve a single\nNot one more justice for Donald Trump Trump will get this pick and he could get a second pick I mean of Ruth Bader Ginsburg leaves the court for some reason the next two years that would give Trump not just this pick the pick of judge Kavanaugh but another pick on top\nThat would set the courts ideological direction I Believe\nTo say we're going to follow the constitution\nFor the next forty years or so given the age of the current justices if they do if the Republicans do not confirm Kavanaugh by the end of this week two things are going to happen one cabinet I won't be seated too there isn't enough time to pick a replacement and run them through the vetting process\nAnd a lot of Republican voters will look at the cave in by the Republicans and say I may not\nShow up in November to vote and when they do that likely we will not get another conservative justice on the court and we will not a ... and we may lose the Senate or the house or a little bit of both and if that happens that America changes\nForever probably and if we do get them on then we have a court that will\nFollow the constitution instead of following ideology and I think the Republicans are voters or a head of the mid term election will be invigorated if for lack of a better word by saying oh the Republicans actually followed through and did what they were supposed to do and that will reflect in their votes in November So\nWe really are at a big divide right now if Kavanaugh gets on it gets in great things are going to happen if he does not I think America we ... we may lose the Republican Congress\nTo vote and when they do that likely we will not get another conservative justice on the court and we will not to an end we may lose the Senate or the house or a little bit of both and if that happens then America changes\nForever probably and if we do get them on then we have a court that will\nFollow the constitution instead of following ideology and I think the Republicans are voters or a head of the mid term election will be invigorated if for lack of a better word by saying oh the Republicans actually followed through and did what they were supposed to do and that will reflect in their votes in November So\nWe really are at a big divide right now if Kavanaugh gets it gets in great things are going to happen if he does not I think America we ... we may lose the Republican Congress and Donald Trump won't get another thing\nDone for the next two years and they will set themselves the Democrats will set themselves up well for twenty twenty\nWhat's been starting to me a lot in regards to that as a Democrat that seems like they they pick and\nChoose what part of the caught that they want to follow up that they don't want to follow them by the way around it or by the way to revert at\nThat as we all have no immigration as well as open border and there'll be a systematic this arm of the citizenry of that\nI think you're absolutely right and and and consider that\nThat not only do the Democrats invent invite a oh boy we just got word cliff I'd mentioned to Frank ... the James Mattis at the Pentagon received a letter didn't go all the way to him but they intercepted as contending rice and uh I just my producers just solar me that we just got word that Trump\nAlso received a letter had they confirmed that there was rice and are they saying just white powder at this point Ted Ted Cruz's office got a letter was far too letters with white powder and apparently President Trump's office also received a letter with white powder in it which is designed to at least\nFrightened and terrorize a if not actually do damage will have to\nFind out what the white powder is but I wanted to work that in but\nThink about what's going to happen if if we go this direction we want people on the court who will follow the constitution the Democrats actually invent things that were never in the constitution for example\nIt might surprise people to know that\nThat privacy is not mentioned anywhere in the constitution but there had been Supreme Court decisions that had been triple A. rated privacy end of the constitution marriage is not mentioned by the constitution but now we have a famous Supreme Court decision recently that\nFound a right to marriage and a right to gay marriage in the constitution\nIf the Democrats are allowed to gain control and put people on the court who would say we can invent things that are not in the constitution and it feels Congress won't pass a law will get the Supreme Court to effectively write a law then a lot of your rights are going to go away\nBut I don't think they realize is that\nYou know what I lost your cell phone and I'm Sorry for that cliff let's go to Dave Dave ... were tied to the break but what's on your mind tonight\nOh just are Republicans do that and I I like that that caller and if they were all the hurt 'em I just want

the potential to talk to both sides and that's twice as big a group is just talking to one side I mean if you're if you're somebody who's in the media business don't you want to sell to both sides of the aisle including Republican or you know\nThe low forehead Neanderthal types like me as well as the elite elite types who read the New York times over there are there ... there are a lot to\nHold

most from both sides that's good\nI'm Glad that check their interviews\nYeah well I Would just imagine Joe what'd you God is you have the potential to talk to both sides and that's twice as big a

the Neanderthal types like me as well as the elite elite types who read the New York times over there are there ... there are a lot to say\nOh well if I'm a journalism perspective or our stories are

conservative by part or Fox News or ... or whatever but and then Democrats obviously will do MSNBC CNN and so on\nBut uh if I was with us we we could share the most from both sides that's become a business perspective arsenic exactly a great point which is sad wouldn't get make more money at a wider audience of bigger than that so yeah or editorial page goes left and right which is fine we we have opinions from both sides\nAnd that our our reporting straight down the middle and that that's the way everybody should should go about their business but uh it's certainly an anomaly and then the exception rather than the rule\nIt also seems odd to that in the coverage of judge Kavanaugh usually reporters are a bit skeptical about just about everything especially claims that you know you can't prove absolutely and and yet I've seen a lot of skepticism go right out the window that\nIf it's a if it's Christian Ford making the allegation it must be true\nAfter all she says this was done to her thirty six years ago even though she can't remember a lot of the details whereas judge Kavanaugh he's just a big heavy drinking loud who was apparently involved in a lead you to rape parties at one point that also stayed secret for the last third of the century you find that believable don't you\nI mean I I think this is one of the worst moments at our media is that a lot of bad moments political maybe I'm Talking about specifically a and ever since the president took office obviously during the two thousand six team but I Can't remember it being as bad as we're seeing it now and I always just kind of put it to this question\nIf this was a Democratic president who nominated a pro fourth or a nomination for the Supreme Court would we see\nEven the Christine forward story getting any legs whatsoever because to your point doesn't know what had happened where it happened how she got home or she's contradict yourself on a couple of occasions in terms of I'm too afraid to fly I Can't testify in this day and it turns out that\nYou know she flies a lot I mean a little thing that you could say well that's just a little thing that deal but hey I mean that goes to credibility and then the stories that we have today lawyers like Brett Kavanaugh was involved in a bar fight a veil and Nineteen eighty five and he threw ice said somebody\nI mean well for for for starters he's a genius because when you think about it the weapon destroys itself right I mean the\nEconomic uh like an ice bullet well and the other thing is finding kids in college who drink beer on Friday nights and sometimes get into either ice fights or food fights is probably not that difficult is it\nTime one of them [laughter] I just confessed on a sweater but I started a massive fight at Boston College my uh my freshman year I wasn't going Arizona Emerson College in Boston but\nI was visiting some friends that I did start one that is true and yes a later and my senior year I did for a picture of beer over another friend at a free beer festival type of thing and yet I mean this is what you do it's ... use this is all part of it but I think now\nThe goalposts moved so much on this that\nIt seems that Democrats and and partisans in the media seemed to be making the argument that it Brett Kavanaugh lied about how much he drank and college than he that disqualified\nLike a like an ice bullet well and the other thing is finding kids in college who drink beer on Friday nights and sometimes get into either ice fights or food fights is probably not that difficult is it\nTime one of them just confessed on Twitter but I started a massive food fight at Boston College my uh my freshman year I wasn't going Arizona Emerson College in Boston but\nI was visiting some friends that I did start one that is true and yes a later at my senior year I did pour a picture of beer over another friend at a free beer festival type of thing and yet I mean this is what you do it's ... youth this is all part of it but I think now\nThe goalposts moved so much on this that\nIt seems that Democrats and and partisans in the media seemed to be making the argument that Brett Kavanaugh lied about how much he drank in college than he that disqualifies him for the Supreme Court okay so that means that Beto O'Rourke who is running for the Senate in Texas against Ted Cruz Jeb\nWho had a DUI and reportedly left the scene of that accent or when he was Nineteen and college\nWrote a paper about the the ... and and but acts of of women of actresses a play that means he's disqualified and then I can go right down the list of Ninety eight percent of of the of the Senate and Congress where people will be disqualified based on the new rules\nThat are being presented it is a dangerous precedent that we're seeing it I think that's why people are so invested bars in in Kavanaugh getting confirmed not because he's a conservative and you want to have another conservative on the court and gay in terms of ideology it's about principle that if you allow these tactics to work here they\nNo sane person able ever going to public service and be you'll never ever be able to get somebody uh approved outside the Supreme Court again because you could go back and find the one thing from their past and not even have a corroborated\nOr any evidence around it and that'll be enough to dismiss that person and destroy their life in the process that's why people are selling desperate 'cause they know what the stakes are here and it's scary\nI'm Talking to Joe ... who's a media columnist for the hill and Joe I thought I'd share this this was just made for you as a media columnist to get a question like this from my see CNN and you know chicken noodle news network talking to the wonderful crazy Mazie Hirono of Hawaii\nYou feel that that is in any way disqualifying for someone to Supreme\nCourt by the way you visited in that case is the ice fight\nBetween eight and ... and because there are a lot of allegations and part of LA are about how he behaves when you talk\nNow this is crazy you've actually got in the media serious journalists supposedly had CNN saying does this size thing disqualify him from the Supreme Court and Mazie Hirono quote a cooperates by saying yes\nThis is why we need the FBI to look into this because of allegations like an ice fight with Chris Dudley at a bar in Connecticut\nRight and and then when this investigation is wrapped up and it's being reported tonight the wall Street Journal that this could very easily be done by tomorrow morning this FBI investigation because again there's ... ... you can investigate something where you don't know what time or a place where the\nUh the board the event happened or no one can corroborated so they interviewed a couple of people are and they got through that will present their findings to the Senate and the and of course the Democratic side will leak out those findings press I can guarantee you that ah but yeah and then and then uh that senator from Hawaii will then say\nYou know obviously this was a rushed FBI investigation we needed something larger in scope and throwing them never be satisfied with this but this has to happen soon because the ... of the world and I call them ... because he is like a ... really where he has no talented you see 'em on TV Everywhere\nSit something else will come out that will be completely and totally unfounded just to muddy the waters more an even this\nBut this could very easily be done by tomorrow morning this FBI investigation because again there that you can investigate something where you don't know what time or a place of where the\nUh the board the event happened or no one can corroborated so they interviewed a couple of people uh they got through that law present their findings to the Senate and of course the Democratic side will leak out those findings press I can guarantee you that ah but yeah and then and then uh that senator from Hawaii will then say\nYou know obviously this was a rushed FBI investigation we needed something larger scope and throwing them never be satisfied with this but this has to happen soon because the ... of the world and I call them ... because he is like a ... really where he has no talented you see him on TV Everywhere\nSays something else will come out that will be completely and totally unfounded just to muddy the waters more and even if Kavanaugh gets confirmed large by the way the Democrats at one here they won the dirtiest way possible but but they painted the GOP now as anti me too\nAnd Taiwan then and it's just such a shame that that people actually believe any of these allegations when you consider there is not a skin killer of evidence around all three of them particularly the ... the one and yet he continues airtime because no one wants to challenge him on basic facts\nOn use getting out of it on but I work with the dissidents and those who are uh you know without being against this regime living outside and supporting it and we know that there are rally is taking place in\nEvery small and large a\nDown and safety in hit on\nA by all the way down from ... Dr drivers to ... to students uh to ordinary people in the streets and this has been going on for quite some time now and the best change and the best revolution comments when\nPeople rise up against an oppressive regime how does the ... on the outside can only support\nThem by saying that you know we are with you and of course as I said ah doors western countries European countries who are still continuing to do business with Iran\nShould also think twice about a continuing to do business with a country that has such a great human rights violations not because I say so because it's always been documented or an ... thoughts and buy a those people who uh watch and monitor\n... nations across the guilt\nShe because that's the part where he'll ditch perhaps the hardest for a lot of us to understand and that is the United states says Iran is a major state sponsor of terrorism the biggest state sponsor of terrorism on the globe and we say we should we should bring these people in the last\nPrasad reaching how does the ... on the outside can only support them by saying that you know we are with you and of course as I said ah does western countries European countries are still

been documented in administering the thoughts and buy a those people who are watching and monitor\n... nations across them go\nSee because that's the part where he'll that perhaps the hardest for a lot of us to understand and that is the United states says Iran is a major state sponsor of terrorism the biggest state sponsor of terrorism on the globe and we say we should we should bring these people in the line\nA as members of the world community I mean I I'm not for global is movement or anything like that but I\nI think that when there are potential threat to the United states and when they have this kind of record with their own people end up sponsoring terrorist acts in their own region which are potential threats to the United states ah when when you know if you could disruption in that region it could cause problems all over the world\nWhy are the Europeans not climbing on board that and saying you're right these people are bad people are they just so focused these countries that want to do business with Iran on saying well but they got they got dollars because Obama gave me as you said getting the dollars and we'd like to sell them stuff\nYes and they've got dollars and they've got\nYeah so you know that relationship as it in such a relationship and the bottom of the mind when you think about this and that would be also a nation that they don't sponsor terrorism just within their own country or they want us to Hamas and Hezbollah outside they they fight militia yet\nA tighter feed on and that is why they're so dangerous so the money that says that down went into the coffers of the afterlife and Jim is was used to sponsor their militias abroad fund to a sponsor that it isn't so\nUh you know I I I also have this past year and it just boggles the mind why are some western leaders European countries will continue to ...\nBut it has to do business with them but then as I said this is a whole other ball game you know it's about money about oil it's about a lot of money\nThat comes to the issue here and that you know the amount of money we're talking about ... fellow soldiers for it so they\nStay put aside the idea that the violation is taking place a

great products and what do you have in your hand right now\nLive or medical ... and this is phenomenal and I'll tell you what this is really especially effective for fatty liver disease and off the plans deliver it's fabulous welcome back Brennan argue there can you hear me okay\nHere to healthy habit and go ahead and ask for free and it's from us so we would like to give them the past um answer possible\nAnd you've kind of um explain it very well Brennan thank you so much you know their products here that we do have on our shelves that John I'm not very familiar with something you can explain it a little bit tighter and that is Sarah ... case do you want to talk to our listeners and myself a little bit about\nThe healthy got protection with Sarah ... taste\nYeah absolutely and let me just expand deli or just previously said\nGood health food stores have folks on the floor who are extremely knowledgeable and educated or understand the products and can the answer is a pretty complex question so ah again when we came out with our line of products this is a physician grant so we really went after\nPhysicians they understand things that are educated they can they can communicate what's going on ... and these are not simple problems have what they do have simple answers\nBut you know health food stores like healthy habit just happened to be sort of that unique I'm now a category of health food stores we do have very educated people on the floor so\nUm we can make ourselves available to you a health food stores like yours and physicians but let me just a jumping surf kept is because that's it's a very interesting enzymes\nSo what we need to do and this really came back from the position it seems like most of our Foreign Relations come back from a feedback from the ... so they were\nA telling us that\nYou know a ... we need to\nReally went after physicians they understand things that are educated they can they can communicate what's going on ... and these are not simple problems they have what they do have simple answers um but\nYou know health food stores like healthy habit just happened to be sort of that unique I'm now a category of health food stores we do have very educated people on the floor so\nUm we can make ourselves available to you a health food stores like yours and physicians but let me just a jumping ... kept taste because that's it's a very interesting enzymes\nSo what we need to do and this really came back from the physicians and it seems like most of our formulations come back from a feedback from the ... so they were\nA telling us that\nYou know a ... we need to really correct a lot of the issues in the digestive track or this is going to be candy and it's going to be parents that's going to be ... okay I'm going to find what ... as well bio film is that accumulation of a naturally occurring you get\nWith all of those that have deleterious organisms a bacteria that shouldn't be there are terrorists sites that you certainly don't want a overactive can't do that and other things along with heavy metal what does that costs will heavy metals allows these things to sort of ball up\nAnd ah connect a in a way that\nOur body can't defend creating double bonds or any of the chemistry major is out there know that double bonds or a ... of the most difficult to break and you can't do it a naturally or in your own body with out assistance that's where the ... comes that\nWe were looking for an enzyme ... takes was the strongest one in nature so that's why we use their pet taste now in addition to reducing ... them which once it accumulates likes to jam itself\nRight in between those Jay channels that pops up and that's what the textbook definition of lake you've got to we do have to address that and we can address it in any other way I'd go after it with a a real good end time if you combine it with candy at a complex\nNow you're breaking up that ... film\nAnd that stuff is in the wound up your digestive tract and then you've got all those nice powerful ingredients and can be a complex\nThey get rid of that will reduce the parasite so they can't do it and all that yeah he added benefit of having Sarah pep taste is that it also goes after supports reduction of scar tissue and when we're talking about the liver and particular when we have damage your liver which most people unfortunately do have\nUm if we start reducing the toxin level with a paddle done and we start reducing the scar tissue is to have taste now the liver\nA can of ... and replenish a liver cells\nThat's one of the things that uh [noise] I mean it's\nVery good uh into the good things to hear from your from a listener a perspective you're bringing your liver or to organs within your body that have incredible ability to juvenile itself and regenerate a tissues in connection so\nIf you end up going down the road and you have fatty liver or uh have heaven forbid you have something in a worse fibrosis with cirrhosis\nUm it's not a death sentence or you can take natural products and reverse a lot of the damage and get back to a reasonably good efficiency even at the uh latest stages of this\nBut we also get a lot of phone calls from women who takes that takes brand dimitrius it's as well so right that a lot of\nVery good very good point Britain we appreciate that so much you know I a tutor a lot of students in a difference\nIt's very good uh into and good things to hear from your approach to listen to a prospective your brain and your liver or to organs within your body that had incredible ability to Cuban itself and regenerate a tissues that connection so\nIf you end up going down the road you have fatty butter or uh have heaven forbid you have something in a worse fibrosis or upset\nOr it's not a death sentence or you can take natural products and reverse a lot of the damage and get back to a reasonably good efficiency even at the uh latest stages of this\nBut we also get a lot of phone calls from women who takes their updates brand dimitrius as well so right that a lot of\nVery good very good point in print and we appreciate that so much\nYou know I a tutor a lot of students in a different forms of chemistry in organic chemistry ah ah we find biochemistry and one of the typical things that they don't understand his credit like if I go through in great detail and explain to them how this whole thing comes together\nAnd then they seem to understand how this relates to the entire body so bring that I really appreciate your detailed explanations this morning we do have a lot of uh of my chemistry students listening right now and they love to hear you on the show because you really break things down\nIn easy to understand communications writer Jennifer yes\nAnd thank you so much again Brandon for explaining the parents have changed and now I'm\nJust saying you know it's like an orchestra and you've got here with your products you know and they all kind of really go together and that's a big circle I mean you don't if you're going to start with wind don't forget to leave another one out you know so um I really love the the way that you put them all together for us so that we can really understand\nAnd use it to to better our health right then\nYou got six point two times and the twenty third [laughter] you'd [laughter] we'd love chemistry and they really bring things down to a grassroots level I said that from my chemistry since we're listening right now but they love to get into details but I'll tell you what Brenda we are\nAre getting on short time and I want to be sure to\nHave you summarize the most important bullet points uh we have about a formula is less than the interview this morning\nTend to kind of give us the or the bottom line on what\nYou think is most important to communicate to the audience this morning\nAnd I really appreciate the time but I I Love getting questions back from the listeners and I I Know that everyone's pay close attention to your show and they like to\nCome into healthy habits and get some really good quality products like the bottom line with our products as they do work synergistic lay on the news the individual level and also a at a group level and if you're suffering from you if you heard of metabolic syndrome\nOr if you haven't heard of that you know look it up you might end up finding that you have a lot of these symptoms\nAnd that's basically what these parks there to attract secondarily\nRead that we made these products in addition to the fact that I don't think that there are formulations out there that accurately hits the nail on the head for a lot of these things is that when they don't always come across clean and what do I mean by that we're accepted by physicians that have very grueling Stanford\nSo ... a micro crystalline say Los magnesium stare right other ...\nOther ex hippie the fillers in these products are either not there whatsoever\nOr their organic or their rice flower K these things are not going to be dangerous to your system whatsoever so those are things that you want to be looking for a in a product line the other thing is our ingredients are in the right form so you know the B. twelve during the meth waited for him you know we don't use\nBasically what these parks or to attract secondarily\nRead that we made these products in addition to the fact that I don't think that there are formulations out there that's accurately hits the nail on the head for a lot of these things is that when they don't always come across clean and what do I mean by that we're accepted by physicians that have very grueling Stanford\nSo a micro crystalline say Los magnesium stare right other ...\nOther ex hippie it the fillers in these products are either not there whatsoever\nOr their organic or their rice flower K these things are not going to be dangerous to your system whatsoever so those are things that you want to be looking for a in a product line the other thing is our ingredients are in the right form\nSo you know the B. twelve during the ... to form you know we don't use milk this'll we use the forms of milk fissile which costs way nature we want to make sure that it's a nice stable a dosage\nSo those are the things that we look for and I hope that those are the things that are customers look forward to because that's how they're going to get healthy um and then just a quick side note here um this is more of a public service announcement than anything\nOkay All right this is the big thing for me um there's there's no conflict of interest here it's the talk that it's a narrow toxin\nOr look up a fluoride or China study\nHarvard just came out with its own study about a month or so ago this is not you know nonsense science it makes no sense why we're throwing fluoride into our utilities into our water systems if you go home and you are going to your bathroom and you'll find fluoride in your toothpaste\nThrow it out run down to healthy habits get a clean toothpaste without fluoride in it\nAnd we've identified fluoride as a IQ reducing talks and so I just wanted to get that out there because it's really important especially for our customers are that are in Arizona in Mexico because you already have naturally occurring Florida in the water\nAnd there's no way to properly dose for it anyway it's a toxin it's dangerous to try and stay away from it and that's\nThat's my advocacy right there for that I really\nYou know I really appreciate that Britain I Hope the audience does as well I Know all the students to\nAnd we do have a lot of uh uh students that was another show on a regular basis daily when they can and medical students and Midwestern University there's a lots of a dental as well as medical students there that rabbit ... show and really get lots of my own mind information so I tell you what Britain and you've hit the\nNail on the head with a lot of different things here I like to talk to bump explanation of other people out there are suffering with that and they don't even realize hey what's this all about\nThe ... really important information and you guys at a liver medic have come up with some amazing products that really help to get to the bottom line and get things back under control again\nAh I Know that uh I'm Glad you brought up about fluoride because there's so many people out there that are poisoning themselves\nCome up with some amazing products that really help you get to the bottom line and get things back under control again ah I Know that I'm Glad you brought up about fluoride because there's so many people out there that are poisoning themselves or with fluoride and I tell you what a wet you brought that up right Jennifer\nChallenges like discomfort sometimes\nThe body can actually be its best\nAttribute is supported properly addressing these challenges you know when you face stress we can't do anything about the stressors that are in your life\nBut with certain support nutritionally to the body\nYou can help your body better equip itself to handle what stresses that deals with\nWhen it comes to sleep when we just simply can't relax the mind certain nutritional support when properly formulated scientifically can help to ease and you know relax the mines that sleep is more you know something that we can have more efficiently and\nSo you know with him fusion sleeper him fusion stress or extra strength ... these are all products that are designed specifically to help one nourish the ... system to support the body nutritionally so that balance is what we trying to achieve and so we do so nutritionally as opposed to more like a drug like effect you know I tell people that\nWhen you're looking to restore balance it's not an event\nThat you should be looking for it's a process that you have to go through and I know that sounds silly but that's in relationship to if people expect that they take one pill much like a drug they get a an immediate reaction\nThat's an event that takes place\nReally when it comes to nursing and in supporting the body it's more about a process that you go through to nurse the body properly and that's what dietary supplements are really targeted at doing some people get an effect right away some people it takes a few days a week or maybe a little longer the fact is we formulate our products scientifically to make sure they work properly\nAnd I talked to last a little bit last week and for those who weren't listening last week you were talking a little bit of how you would um like like take the um the three point O. with a five point ... fusion\nFor comfort and added with that sweet formula or you're stressed formula you can take it they gather you want to highlight a little bit about that\nWell you know product I mean the way the products are formulated is that if I'm\nIf dealing with a challenges a stress during the day and you just need some extra support the stress formula can be taken during the day and if and if you need a little extra support well I'm In the area of relaxation so that may be sleep is more possible you can take our sleep formula you know and taking the five point oh formula ...\nOur products can be taken together because they're very modestly in nutritionally considered as far as how they're built\nAnd they're they're effective even when used in combination as well but I Will tell you the ideology behind more is better\nYou weren't listening last week you were talking a little bit of how you would um like like take the um the three point O. with a five point of the half fusion\nFor comfort and you added with fat to sleep formula or you're stressed formula you can take it they gather you want to highlight a little bit about that\nWell you know product I mean the way the products are formulated is that if I'm\nIf dealing with a challenges a stress during the day and you just need some extra support the stress formula can be taken during the day and if and if you need a little extra support while I'm In the area of relaxation so that maybe sleep is more possible you can take our sleep formula you know and taking the five point oh formula ...\nOur products can be taken together because they're very modestly in nutritionally considered as far as how they're built\nAnd they're they're effective even when used in combination as well but I Will tell you the ideology behind more is better\nWill tell you it's not necessarily the case you know in fact there is some research out there that will actually um if you ever want to look up this research I like the base things on science as well to make sure that formulation as as much or an art does it is this is science but on the scientific aspects so many people think well if\nFive milligrams of CBD which confusion contained CBD products in fact the number on the front whether it says three point over five hundred designates how many milligrams of CBD that it has preserving but\nThat being said um if you were to take CBD specifically just an isolated are standardized there's research to show that something called the bell shaped curve so that when you consume\nIt as you increase the dosing over a short period of time the body can and maybe it'll start offering a benefit of some kind but then it'll stop working what the research also says\nIs that to overcome this bell shaped curve dose response taking a true full spectrum our whole food version one that has the entire you know the the complete entourage effect\nEngaged in the formula like meaning through food version you're actually not going to necessarily experience that same challenge him fusion aimed all of its sights scientifically formulating its product to engage the whole entourage effect meaning\nTrue support of the ... system as opposed to just isolating a particular nutrient\nWell this is very important and we appreciate the inside this morning Dr Mitchell and Jennifer as you've been making notes you got lots of questions\nYeah I'm a again we just have so many people coming into healthy habit here and can save you know\nTouched on that CBD so they're calling it everything [laughter]\nI'm like you mean CBD so it's so nice to explain I'm you know like which product is right for them but I like the way that you've got your formula to gather that it's not just the CBD Oil alone as a stand alone that you've got it together as a\nSymphony of you know the product down there so again a lot\nOf people have that misconception on Hampton that is it legal\nAnd all of that kind of stuff do you want to highlight a little bit more and more in Tampa legal and uh you know because they have so many questions\nYou know that's a really good question and you know I I I I'm very careful in the theory of discussion because so many people are passionate about it the one thing that I can say is absolutely true and I think every hemp company in the market would agree with me is that prohibition on this beautiful plant is ending\nUnfortunate though the prohibition as it ends legally it's painful and in this pain that we all suffer from the understanding of what is truly legal and isn't there is a lot of misconception or or or a lot of ideas thrown around as to what is true but really what it all zero zero in on is what is the law say\nIf you're asking me a legal question we've had a lot of um legal guidance through some very influential compliance\nI'm legal or individuals in the industry not necessarily him for marijuana advocates rather true compliance\nMany questions you know that's a really good question and you know I I I I'm very careful in this area of discussion because so many people are passionate about it the one thing that I can say is absolutely true and I think every hemp company in the market would agree with me is that prohibition on this beautiful plant is ending it's\nUnfortunate though the prohibition as it ends legally it's painful and in this pain we all suffer from the understanding of what is truly legal and isn't there's a lot of misconception or or or a lot of ideas thrown around as to what is true but really what it all zero zero in on is what is the last say\nYou're asking me a legal question we've had a lot of um legal guidance through some very influential compliance\nI'm legal or individuals that are in the industry not necessarily him for marijuana advocates rather\nTrue compliance attorneys I called them alphabetically alphabet agency lawyers they deal with the F da da\n... see you know all the alphabet agencies right and so when when they deal with these people they know one how they work to what the law says and what the interpretation is going to be of the law so when answering that question about the law here's what I Know to be factual that is the controlled substance act\nSays very specifically the definition of what marijuana is but it also says what is considered him\nWhat they talk about is that and what is legal according to the controlled substances act as long as you have a T H the content of less than point three percent now that's the psychoactive component the one that everybody gets worried about him\nI wouldn't say that our government is a little bit too worried about they shouldn't be concerned about that ... that can happen or where yes it does\nUm ah contribute to someone feeling the effects of being high it does happen to this little effect and it's very very powerful and the more that we can wrap our heads around it scientifically I think the better off we're going to be as a society because the plant is beautiful but regardless of that that's off the menu but\nThey do exclusively tell you in a controlled substance act that you can only use the stock in the seeds that cannot Germany now\nToday though there exists the presence of a law called the two thousand fourteen farm bill it has recently expired 'cause there are still debating over the uh two thousand Eighteen the new farm bill but while that's happening all the rules and stuff that Oregon the two thousand fourteen farm bill are still there this farm bill do\nTwo thousand fourteen is where a lot of people get confused over because in this in this particular law what they call subsection Seventy six so sex they talk specifically about expanding the definition to not only\nLimit him from the stock and seeds but they exclude you know they excluded the flour into controlled substance act but the farm bill kind of brings it back in but it says for research purposes it says under approved pilot programs that says that it's to be you know in conjunction with a\n... institution of higher learning you know we're in that bill does it say for retail purposes crossing state lines commercially grown and so there's a lot of real confusion about that and that's why everybody's so excited about that we know the pending in two thousand Eighteen farm bill because it kinda clarifies all that\nIf you want to know what's real and what's legal you want to make absolutely sure that your product is kids some controlled substance act compliance and if you can ask that question the answer's yes than legal now there's the other side of it though is is it legal as dietary supplements see the FDA has their own set of rules that they\nThey go by on what can be sold as dietary supplements and\nWhen it comes to that there are specific rules and regulations the one beautiful thing about him fusion is that we abide by all the required regulations under FDA so that means that our products has a dietary supplement our legal in the eyes of the FDA\nWe are a C.

I remember it was an August and I'm thinking of a two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on and talking about how people were losing trust and institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was the only two groups and and this was before ... and by the way some remember that part of it so whatever that you know few months before that\nSo they re ... there were only two institutions that more than half the people in this country had faith in one of which was the military at Seventy seven percent\nAnd the other was cops at about fifty two percent\nAnd one of the points I made was and again this was pretty Ferguson is you know there was a lot of pressure already be put on kind of people's views of cops and that may not be holding given that it was only fifty two percent back then and that would have very important implications\nAbout how people were losing trust in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was there were only two groups in and this was before Ferguson by the way some remember that part of it or whatever that you know few months before that so they rate\nWhat they're only two institutions that more than half the people in this country had faith in one of which was the military at Seventy seven percent\nAnd the other was cops at about fifty two percent\nAnd one of the points I made was and again this was pretty Ferguson is you know there was a lot of pressure already be put on kind of people's views of cops and that may not be holding given that it was only fifty two percent back then and that would have very important implications\nBut real lined the total lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and it will have consequences for the market and as I mentioned\nI have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if they're right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings\nAnd it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just because I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the classroom and to be teaching is before the crash and the ideas is classes and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach\nBut the idea of this is before the market goes down you gotta know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up\nBut the average retail trade or will never make money and the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I just want a thought too about you know people keep coming in and told me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors well defined investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realize that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble they put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong and again\nThe market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is that when the market turns\nUnderstand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up but the average retail trade or will never make money and the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I just want a thought too about you know people keep coming in and telling me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors will define investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realize that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble they put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong and again\nThe market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is is that when the market turned down a can turn down very quickly if you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of game think about this from it Thirteen Years of games in a year and a half okay\nIf you want Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now\nHow is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down and you can on the move up so getting class we're gonna talk about all these ideas we're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people focus on what's called technical analysis they're using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked with are like four okay\nYou know you have your ... to ... and your are your uh see the eyes and ears for thousands or hundreds of these things right so how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got they won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of the guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecast is really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there's there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now and the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes [laughter]\nAnd that's a lot of this is that people used something because it's the best they think they've got but it's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things are really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market is supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did that would make this a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but\nWe always make sure that when we're wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing as opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do\nPurposes and that's a lot of this is that people use something because it's the best they think they've got but it's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market is supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make this a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but we always make sure that when we wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing\nAs opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do so again if you want to come out to a class I'm going to be teaching this one personally when you come out if you if

... sports bar in Nineteen Ninety eight [noise]\nGetting into to those ideas and just a couple of minutes but the to me the key is you have to know what to do before things go bad if you wait till they go bad is it happens way too fast and you can't react in time\nYou've got to be position before it happens now when the markets falls I mentioned the market when it fell in two thousand eight two thousand nine the market and the and the gay backs Thirteen Years of profits in a year and a half\nThat's how fast these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to his two thousand level and that was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years and people think well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon most people's investment horizon it's thirty five to forty years\nAnd if you lose twenty or twenty five years\nYou because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside that's very very hard for people to achieve their goals\nSo we're going to be talking about how do we identify the prices which big institutions like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at you know when he was buying apple it a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five\nThat would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and I will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was fined apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics\nOf how I don't want to actually make money when the stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is that they invest in stocks because they think they're safe stocks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into because their markets only open six and a half hours a day Seventeen and a half hours of every day and forty eight hours of every weekend you cannot protect yourself\nYes you can use options to limit your losses but you're still going to have launches okay if you had homeowner's insurance and it only covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected I think most people would not OK\nAnd adapt the situation people in in the market so again to me this is an incredibly important in class and I will I run I've taught this class before is always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those will be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThey the world has changed in my opinion from a marketing manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you can always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at at charts and looking it indicators which are the wrong thing did they fundamentally better approach again that I Will teach in class\nI think most people would not okay and my dad the situation people in in the market so again to me this is an incredibly important class and I will I've ... I've talked to this class before is always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those would be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThat the world is changed in my opinion from a marketing arena manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you could always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at it charts and looking it indicators which are the wrong thing there's a fundamental we'd better approach again and I will teach in class so we want to come out and get to free tickets free tablet plus we'll feed you launch\nBe one of the next dozen callers\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that's T.

A. as in online trading academy two\nThree one nine nine six if you win tickets please\nRegistered so we know you're coming that way will have a seat for you have your tablet and your lunch and all will be cool okay\nLots of risk to this market but let's talk about some signs for that may be nearing atop\nFirst it was during the wall Street Journal today\nThat of the companies that are going public this year eighty three percent of them are losing money\nNow that is the highest in recorded history anytime they've tracked that this is the biggest number of it's ever been is now a clipped what was happening in the year two thousand or eighty one percent of the companies were not profitable\nWhen companies are going public and then the stocks are going up which many of the stocks are where there are these ridiculous evaluation\nThere were known as unicorn stocks these companies that have no profits that are worth a billion dollars or more\nThat is a sign of a bubble and that is a sign that we are closer to the end than we are to the beginning of this Ron\nThere's another story I just read that\nCharles Schwab investors which a classic retail traders are now sitting on less cash than they've been at any time in history so they're becoming quote unquote fully invested well that is a lot of implications what drives the market it's supply and demand if you've taken away the demand\nAnd there isn't more money on the sidelines to kind of come in and then what's going to take the market up to the next level\nNow what's been taking it up is companies buying back their own stock and companies are buying back a record amount of stock this year they've never bought so much and that constrains supply and that could drive this market higher again\nThis is it I don't want to be giving you some big doom and gloom thing this market can keep going higher than the repatriation of all that money coming back from overseas is a huge part of what's driving this market higher now it's a one time deal but some of the people aren't spending the money this year and that could spend it next year\nCash than they've been at any time in history so they're becoming quote unquote fully invested well that is a lot of implications what drives the market it's supply and demand if you've taken away the demand\nAnd there isn't more money on the sidelines to kind of come in and then what's going to take the market up to the next level\nNow what's been taking it up is companies buying back to their own stock and companies are buying back a record amount of stock this year they've never bought so much and that constrains supply and that could drive this market higher again\nThis is it I don't want to be giving you some big doom and gloom thing this market can keep going higher than the repatriation of all that money coming back from overseas\nIs a huge part of what's driving this market higher now it's a one time deal but some of the people aren't spending the money this year and that could spend it next year so maybe you got a little bit left in the tank next year\nBut at some point it has to come down and again we need to be prepared for that before it happens we got to have the fundamental skills to be able to benefit from this happens\nBecause you can actually make more money faster on the downside than the upside but at a minimum we've got to know how to protect what we've got so again the class someone to be teaching on before the crash what do you do and also what we're going to cover is what is it keeps going up what should we be doing\nThere's always a way to make money in this market but we always have to start with risk management again\nBe one of the next dozen callers you can get to free tickets free tablet when you come out the number to call is eight for for eight eight seven twenty three thirty seven or text letters old T.\nA. as in online training academy two three one nine nine six season it [noise]\nHi this is Ken and you're on the right side of the trade between the black helicopters and CNBC there's the right side of the trade right side of the trade is brought you buy it online training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education All right this week we've been talking\nAbout the ... kind of the state of the market and why I think we're closer to the top than the bottom at this point by a very long way and in fact why you may see a top in this market pretty soon you know early this year I said I thought you'd see the top this year\nAnd we don't we haven't really gone much above where we were in January kind of gone back and forth around there\nYou know I said we could have one more run this year and you could look anything's possible you could even get a bit of a run next year but what's going to keep taking this market higher and in the wind segment I told you a little bit about what I see as evidence of the top and the market\nOne is the fact that more companies are going public selling shares initial public offering to ... cattle more companies that have no profits than ever in history so Wall Street journal today to eighty three percent of the company's going public right now having earnings have gone public the last twelve months no earnings\nIn two thousand the height of the dot com it was eighty one percent so that again is kind of big bubbly sign\nNext big bubbly sign that the fact that you go to a place like Charles Schwab where it's retail traders not professionals okay they have their customers have less cash sitting on the sidelines than they've had at I think it any time in history if I remember correct but they don't have a lot of extra money\nAnd in the wind segment I told you a little bit about what I

person that she names I\nHad come out and said either they didn't call it or didn't happen or they weren't there every single bit of evidence and facts that we've seen in this moment supportive judge Kavanaugh's case and the president simply pointed out the facts of the matter and that is what the Senate will have to you to determine whether or not they vote to support him or not\nOr something I actually drove traveled on\nThink both Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh ah or victims at the hands of the Democrats I think it is absolutely disgraceful\nWhat they've done and exploited this process they exploit a doctor for their exploiting all of the women that have come out to make any type of accusation isn't the process that should've been done and certainly everybody deserves to be hurt but that includes judge Kavanaugh and that should be part of this process and the facts have to be looked at\nAnd I think you have to look at the prosecutors memo\nDoes or where you see all of those facts laid

supplemental background check or to look into each of the accusations and allegations that the Senate deems\nA necessary before making a vote um he's also um been more than happy to give a platform to the accusers that have come out against a then President Bill Clinton I did it say that he's never started with women it's just ridiculous\nAll of a sudden it inside and that is a reason why\nThough he is calling for an investigation saying that\nAfter a judge Kavanaugh has been in public service and in the public eye for over twenty six years been through six background investigation now part of the seven\nThat this is the first time you're ever hearing of any of these allegations the fact that all through all of those background check not even an inkling of any of those things is ever come up despite the fact he was one of the top prosecutors\nFor Ken Starr in in a major public position\nNone of these things came up when he was nominated to be on the federal bench none of these things came up he has been a public figure and there's been a lot of opportunity for people to raise that issue and it never has and now at the eleventh hour the Democrats have exploited this process\nAnd done so publicly and it's a shame and he simply calling that out thanks so much\nSo I don't know if you could tell Sarah Huckabee Sanders is not having any of general Costas nonsense today did you
