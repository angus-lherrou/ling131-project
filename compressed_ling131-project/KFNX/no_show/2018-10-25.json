I Can't believe a lot of things like you do I think it's going to get worse before it gets better I mean we don't for our heads were all in trouble\nI'm Greg good call I agree the problem is here's the problem this country is so much more divided than we all know\nThree one two six for two fifty six hundred who's to blame\nYou've got everybody on the left blaming President Trump for what happened today\nI just I just\nDon't buy that one I owed a let me go to a Tony hey Tony around with Joe\nHey Joe you know my first instinct this morning was you know I wanted to jump on the bandwagon of false flag and all that but then thinking it through in order to do that you have to assume that motives of this individual your last caller had it right I think it will get worse and here's the thing I Do think that Trump\nTactic um whether I agree with them or not I think you can put some blame on that the same that you can put blame on Maxine Waters and the things that she goes out and says and assuming the motives of others and then acting on that is a tactic of black that's generally what you ... you know you can\nSay you see that on that side um if for example or identity politics in order to claim something as hate speech or or to say that you know\nWhite privilege this or anything along those lines you have to assume the motives of individual before a factor in in that you know we didn't want to make any assumptions before the facts rent for cabinet and I shouldn't make any substance\nI'm Tony ... play this out for me I I'm trying to understand what you're saying 'cause it's interesting show if if if you've got Trump out there who month after month calling the media the enemy of the people\nAnd then some madman grabs a gun and shoots a member of the media because he can't stand the media 'cause they're the enemy of the people are does Donald Trump have any blame for what that Mad Men did\nWell I'm sure they that argument could be made that is to blame but the point is you know when you play it out you know what your last caller said is exactly right that's what the ... that the justice system is therefore is to work on his kinks out and quicker and take it down to the level of the individual\nYou know rhetoric is rhetoric and if people can't handle it you shouldn't get involved\nIn a good call Tony no in in your right nothing comes right there with you look you know I and I've said from the beginning I don't like it when Trump calls the meeting the enemy of the people I think it's dangerous and I don't I don't think it makes sense but if you got Trump author call on the media the enemy of the people\nAnd then some guy grabs a gun and shoots a member of the media um the guy who grabbed the gun and shot a member of the media\nHe's responsible for that and he's going to pay a price for that there's a big difference between Donald Trump saying the media is\nThe enemy the people or Donald Trump saying hey come on everybody grab your gun ghost shoot a member of the media if Donald Trump said that at one of his rallies everybody needs to go shoot a member of everybody needs to go shoot somebody at CNN and then somebody shot somebody at CNN I guarantee you Donald Trump will be held liable for that as well\nBut there's a big difference between expressing an opinion the media\nThe beginning I don't like it when Trump calls the meeting the enemy of the people I think it's dangerous and I don't I don't think it makes sense but if you've got Trump author call on the media the enemy the people and then some guy grabs a gun and shoots a member of the media um the guy who grabbed the gun and shot a member of the media\nHe's responsible for that and he's going to pay a price for that there's a big difference between Donald Trump saying the media is the enemy the people or Donald Trump saying hey come on everybody grab your gun ghost shoot a member of the media\nIf Donald Trump said that at one of his rallies everybody needs to go shoot a member of everybody needs to go shoot somebody at CNN and then somebody shot somebody at CNN I guarantee you Donald Trump would be held liable for that as well\nBut there's a big difference between expressing an opinion the media is the enemy the people or the media sucks\nAnd the president saying go go attack a member of the media there's a big big difference between that let me go to Dave Dave you're on the Joe\nJoe [noise] um\nI just got or heard about this on my way and work for the first time but it's funny that none of these bombs were off [noise] I mean [laughter]\nYou know it's going to make 'em you think that one of them or something would have went off [laughter] well you know the Democrats and the media they cause a lot of the problems or you know I'm sure Trump Trump is angry\nUm [noise] you know but um [noise]\nEverything goes through or two years now or a little longer\nI don't blame him on\nA day thanks um\nThe ... the\nBomb that was at CNN it was reported to be a alive device it did not go off it could have gone off um the other devices\nIs the one got to George Soros his residence\nOr the again the the the one bit Maxine Waters and Eric Holder and block Obama be\nYou know they they don't Brock Obama doesn't go out and get his mail every day uh they they they go somewhere else where they're screened a first and that's where these devices were found\nOr just to kind of be technical on\nThat point um\nLook we live in a divided country right now the rhetoric is heated right now I think it's going to get more heated right now um and I think this is just the road we're on a I think it's imperative that we all condemn violence or as much as we can\n[noise]\nAny time to check the wall street freedom

slash pot cashed 'em one note though here for all of you\nI don't want you to think that uh the Republicans losing the house is a foregone conclusion it isn't\nIt isn't\nAnd it most certainly is and if you all get out and vote that's for sure\nTwenty three seats in this environment that's not easy to do\nBut it's not automatic right now\nWe're still two weeks out a lot of these races are very close it's not to bore you with a\nPossibility probability statistics\nBut you could wake up the morning after the midterms and the Democrats only picked up twelve said the Democrats are going to pick up seats in the house\nOf that you can be assured\nThere's no way the Republicans will pick up seats the Democrats are going to make games\nI can guarantee you\nI mean that pretty much pretty much always happens\nOr the first midterm\nUh for the opposition party\nThat that's not on Trump dishes\nWe're still two weeks out a lot of these races are very close it's\nNot to bore you with a\nPossibility probability and statistics but you could wake up the morning after the midterms and the Democrats only picked up twelve stayed the Democrats are going to pick up seats in the house\nOf that you can be assured there's no way the Republicans will pick up seats the Democrats are going to make gains\nI can guarantee you\nI mean that pretty much pretty much always happens\nOr the first to mid term\nOr for the opposition party\nThat that's not on Trump this is American history this always happens\nThe president's party loses seats the president's party will not lose seats in the Senate because we have not seen as a Senate map like this a hundred years but the president's party Trump's party is going to lose a lot of seats in the house\nThe only question is\nHow many\nHow many\nAnd the only real question is twenty three or more\nTwenty ... twenty three they retain control\nThey they take control Democrats take control if they get twenty three seats in the house that's the magic number\nIf they if they pick up Nineteen seats that's a big big game\nBut the Republicans retained control\nControl of the house is so dang important maybe I'll I'll hop upon that and the next segment\nBut no this thing is still very fluid it's very up in the air I was telling somebody yesterday based on all the\nDifferent scenarios I've looked at and all the data I've looked at\nThe Democrats could pick up fifty seats in the house they could pick up twelve\nSomewhere between twelve and fifty depending on how big a Democrat year it is depending upon how big this wave is\nYou by the way I\nCan help determine how big this Democrat wave is a lot depends upon what you're gonna do if Republicans and Democrats excuse me if Republicans and conservatives\nCome out if there's a red wave like if Republicans and conservatives come out and vote like a much\nMore than in a normal mid term\n\nThat'll minimize the games the Democrats make\nA again I don't want to fool yeah the Democrats are going to gain seats in the house there's no way the Republicans gain seats but if the Republicans come out in droves\nIf the Republican turnout is huge\nThey can limit does Democrat gains\n\nAnd I think if Republican turnout is really solid really really strong\nThen I think Republicans keep control of the house so see that's where like you all come in\nLike a much more than in a normal mid term\n\nThat'll minimize the games the Democrats make\nA again I don't want to fool yeah the Democrats are going to gain seats in the house there's no way the Republicans gain seats but if the Republicans come out in droves\nIf the Republican turnout is huge\nThey can limit does Democrat gains\n\nAnd I think if Republican turnout is really solid really really strong\nThen I think Republicans keep control of the house\nSo see that's where like you all come in\nThat's for every Republican and conservative listening to me right now run the country that's where you come in and I we can't control can we what the Democrat turnout is going to be we can't control that\nDon't even want to try to control that\nBut we can control what we do\nBut just so you know or\nYou sit here right now and listen to me right now\nBarring a miracle on the part of the Democrats\nThe Republicans keep control of the Senate or the Democrats will make gains in the house that is certain\nWhether they make enough gains to take over the house that is on certain\nThey got a lot of stars lined up to help them\nBut it ain't a done deal yet it's not a done deal by any means a lot of seats that the Democrats have to win\nAre right now is seats held by Republicans are in many in like suburban districts and these Republicans\nAre putting up really good strong fights\n\nAnd these races are like\nA lot of 'em are within the margin of error so you see it I mean it's really it's really really close\nFinal point though on control I'll get to that right now um\nThe Democrats take over the house life's gonna change pretty dramatically\nYou're giving power to the Democrats you're giving subpoena power to the Democrats\nThe Democrats will try to investigate President Trump out of existence I I don't know you know for sure whether it'll move to impeach him\nBut they will most certainly try to investigate\nEvery inch of him and that's what the next two years will turn out to be\nYou know putting aside just putting aside the fact that the Democrats\nWill stop Trump's agenda\nPretty dramatically\nYou're giving power to the Democrats you're giving subpoena power to the Democrats\nThe

I was so may be reborn either in the human body or in the body of a non human animal\nAnd so an animal might be a smoker or move I come back as an animal I Know when we might have been an animal and another line\nAnd so there is a respect for animals than a recognition of them as being an important part of a\nRoutine visit in light men that they talk about\nWith Native American animals were an integral part of their lives on the uh animals were respected they uh it was the earth and the moon and um the animals the crows they learn from animals maybe things that among\nThey did hunt but only ... and ... oh you're right\nAnd so what happened to me is what happened to us [laughter] [laughter] well what happened was the um ended in my mid ... move the car in the early sixteen hundred and then\nI'm old and a recognition of them as being an important part of of reaching this and lightning meant that they talk about\nWas Native American animals were an integral part of their lives on the uh animals were respected they uh there was the earth and the moon and uh the animals the crow is just through they learn from animals maybe these things for the animals\nThey did hunt but only for food and asking permission or the animal spirit and so what's happened to us you know what happened to us\nWhat happened was the uh aged enlightenment came mistake cards in the early sixteen hundred and there was this mechanistic framework for human societies and for the universe itself the thought was that um\nThat the body was a machine\nKnow fake news independent talk eleven hundred ...\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nWell we are back with Wanda book [noise]\nReally the wisdom and the knowledge of the animal a wander during the regular mentioned what is our impact on the animals\nOn the earth and maybe maybe nobody thinks about that\nWell I think there's um [laughter] I mean some people that do when I was I'm thinking about this ah it was\nClear to me that how when I'm pretty down animals and look at animals and interact with them it depends on culture um the the ... century that we live in sometimes even the decade whether we are affluent or not\nI mean if you ah go into a dog and cat door now and you have the ones that do food in veterinary stuff but they also and stuff and and some of them only so close that is specifically named\nDog and a button making a dog for a walk\nAnd how it would hurt a write\nIn fifty years ago so whereas\nUm when I think of my time that dog I cannot remember them ever going to the vet and\nI'm pretty to animals and look at animals and interact with them it depends on our culture and um the the countries that we live in sometimes even the decade whether we are affluent or not\nI mean if you go into a dog and cat doors now and you have the ones that sell food and veterinary stuff but they also cell phone and and some of them only so close that are specifically made for\nDogs and ... to take your dog for a walk\nAnd I would be a hero right even fifty years ago so whereas\nUm when I think of my childhood dogs I Do not remember them ever going to the debt\nAnd now it's not only do people take their dogs and cats and forces to the veterinarian and also the birds and they're um losers in may\nBut there's acupuncture there is he looking for them that there is a massage his actual era I write my\nSo we can't really make a blanket statement\nI'm like it um there are dogs that they're with homeless people on this beat by seeing some cats are not too\nMuch out of their lives are very different and it's one ways and those of a a couple who\nHas two dogs but they completely and totally and do what is this thing is that most people loved those animals unconditionally and the animals give that to them from from their gender this time they are\nThey are they're friends they're loyal\nAnd so when we look at how animals impact us we realize how much they do for us\nThey entertain those with their antics they um make guard our homes\nAnd yet at the same time to be a very slow and loving and the little kids all over all over them\nSo it is definitely a a give and take and I mean we often look at animals as as being there for us it's that idea that comes to that national have dominion over all the earth\nAnd and that animals you know when you see the evolutionary charge you see it and then there's a man right\nWhat is the other tried like the octopus and and ... they\nThey shared like a a flat worms um that we spend their two lines began to diverge from the platform develop the octopus and develop the human\nWell maybe the octopus is very very top of their evolutionary shame it's just a different change and an hour's\nAll of the time when you see the other things with showing how animals progress to be termed an alligator or to become a dog\nThat line they never show it going up as far as the feeling because this I just as they said oh these stopped evolving and humans kept on and they became the smart when they became the ones with those than with the motions and um and it was\nIt's just it's simplistic of abuse\nWanda ... don't\nSpeak\nAnd from the platform develop the octopus and develop the human well maybe the octopus is various the very top of their evolutionary chain it's just a different change than ours all of the time when you see the other\nThings with showing how animals progress to be some an alligator or do you become a dog\nThat line they never show it going up as far as the feeling because as I did is they said oh these stopped evolving and humans have done and they came to spot when they became the ones with those them with a motion and um and it was\nIt's just it's just simply because if you\nLook at a wand got fish king don't\nSpeak and into historically it any better and more credit that you're saying well\nIt depends on how large of a role the uh the animal played in their lives\nFor use you know the Native Americans and um and first nation Alaskan people um hunted whales and it was a very large part of their culture and was accompanied by ceremonies and um by having\nIt was a very sacred pies and um the northwest where the salmon was such a big part of a food for the people who live here\nThat it was a large part of their lives because they were intrigued at least it's related you know many people including me eat beef every day but the cows that came from is\nNot living in the past your next to me so it makes it different relationships I don't have a personal relationship is just a game\nThat means so it's um I think what I'm trying to say and I am not a close to us but many people who could address this better than I could but\nLet our lives are intertwined with those of our animals\nIn terms of our survival and posted it as an emotional wellbeing then we have greater respect for them and greater carrying\nThis so we're no longer you know having um people rush into the great plains and kills bubbles by the hundred for the time\nOr just the thrill of it\nThat doesn't happen now perhaps part of why that happened is because the men who were killing and hunting them does not respect the animals and they thought that they would last for ever said you couldn't possibly massacre all of them\nSo channel that wander becoming more extinct\n[noise] well the ... I have a paper here which I really appreciate the uh the guardian or it was on and they is twenty eight team that they've published this and so um\nAnd they say about half the earth animals are it's not some of them lost in the last\nClown yeah and so I'm\nNo I'm just one fifth of wild animals for myself I wasn't remain in the oceans missed three centuries of\nAnimals and they saw says they would last for ever said you couldn't possibly massacre all of them\nSo which channel that wander becoming more extinct [noise]\nWell the ... I have a paper here which I really appreciate the uh the guardian or it was on and may is twenty eighth team that they've published this and so um\nAnd they say about half the earth animals or it's not some of them lost in the last ...\nWow yeah\nAnd so I'm so no I'm just one fifth of wild animals for myself and remain in the oceans missed three centuries is Leyland there's this this this is the marine mammals in the ocean\nAnd this is a fascinating article and and um I recommend that everyone is sort of put things in perspective and so instead of asking\nWhat purpose does animals have in our lives\nI think it's time to ask what person do we have in their lives\nThat's a good question shut off saving our [noise] for just like a dog actually like a horse what um\nHow would you want one inside the battle for ...\nWell oh horses were domesticated quite early and I'm reading programs even in the early years like the ...\nUm they had to have horses that can survive in the desert those are the Arabian that we now know today\nAnd so they were bred three characteristics that made them able to live in that environment so there's dirty they uh have great resilient they are they are wonderful horses they're um they're not a docile\nFor us right\nAnd and so as ...\nAs we bred animals\nWe did bring them so that for many of them they would become the best that they can be and so\nThere's a line of reading of those dog cat horses cows dairy cows so that they are\nThe ultimate example of of how and I'm having a an enduring because we have read for certain characteristics that would have taken them\nHundreds of years to do on their own we have read something out of them as the same time I did misspeak animals can no longer live in the wild because those parents have been since I've been bred out as\nHundreds of years to do on their own we have read something out of them at the same time ... animals can no longer live in the wild because those parents haven't read out of ...\nBut I wanted to come back to the idea of that if we if we left it was only the strong survive\nWhat what has happened to us what what would we as humans have long we have\nLost art is um the people who are really really good cook but maybe not so mobile I mean what do you think of all of the characteristics we need we need people who are sensitive to care more about other than the so\nAnd and this and\nWe don't care if they can run the fastest miles you know we don't care as far as spouse is the strongest men on the blog it's much more important to us I'm loyal to use the bill is the love I Know\nThe handles and think of the other person and so natural selection\nI've is great for the survival level but so many levels above that and you can see the emotional intelligence the force and\nNow this dog and cat how sensitive they are human emotions and to the emotions of other animals of their own pieces\n[noise] if you have any questions will want to shake so to ship and seven fifty three sixty nine or a chick six five three six one one zero zero and he questioned it all at I'm thinking about right now no mission to control [noise]\n[noise] um\nWhy do you think we're drawing to a certain [noise] [noise] like I Know for myself I'm drawn to cats\nUh-huh well I'm not sure that that doesn't think in every case is the same um but I can tell you that I don't know um\nAnyone who is drawn to like burning coal or to you know the worms [laughter] we forget that that is all part of the ... of the animal kingdom and\nSo as humans we have a definite cuteness factory um you know we like animals as big eyes brown faces and so does most and they have\n[noise] um [noise] well I think she went on to a certain [noise] [noise] like I Know for myself I'm trying to catch\nUh-huh well I'm not sure that I don't think in every case is the same um but I can tell you that I don't know um\nAnyone who is drawn to like barnacles or to you know the worms [laughter] we forget that that is all part of the ... of the animal kingdom and\nSo as humans we have a definite cute no factory um you know we\nLike animals and the guy brown faces\nAnd so does most and they have um they have shown this to be true and they think it's because I'm animals that looks more like babies as we are more likely to take care of them and to take them into our and our houses of course this does not explain the people who love horses\nSo I think that there is a lot of wind which we have\nAn emotional connection to who we believe them to be\nAnd sometimes a picture of who they are is quite accurate and perhaps sometimes as us imposing that picture on them like many people are drawn to cast instead of dogs because they feel like has been more independent\nAnd that is true [laughter] they have a ... year those in a\nIf you didn't like cats and you went into a room and there was a cast their um people will say over and over I I just can't stand cats and she does a cat in the room they come and sit on my last [laughter]\nYeah so the cat's going to have a sense of humor I think he has a very\nBeautiful they are I'm closer to the wild than dogs I I'm I'm actually interesting well many cat\nNot the ones that are highly bread particularly you know was really smashed faces or the or the ones that are bred to be really I'm a black in days ago so\nMany cats the cats but you might see a at your local shelter the kittens are available for adoption\nIs they end up getting caught outside um that they can survive so we still have cats that are buying cat we had a cat that move both in our houses an outsider house who are still hunting and killing\nAnd so and that's what I mean by them being closer to the wild\nOn many of them have the skills to stay alive and uh and outside environment now this does not mean they live a long time cats who are outdoor cats I have an average of about two years\nWhereas in your home they can have a lifespan is Fifteen them more so it's a tough world out there\nAnd and when animals get old in the wild they if they are a lot\nOf prey animal they will be they will be killed that is how life is\nAnd so I don't know does that answer your question but that but people who loved cats they like they tend to like the independent they are drawn to um the stuff\nStay alive and uh and outside environment now this does not mean they live a long time had who I think that I have an average by about two years whereas in your home they can have a life span is no more\nNo it's a tough world out there\nAnd and when animals get old in the wild if they are a\n... I don't know very well be they will be killed that is how life yeah\nAnd so I don't know does that answer your question but that but people do love cats they like they tend to like independent they are drawn to 'em so yeah the cat the they're interested in and they're having\nThem and watch them off in the wild but it's still in watching them\nWe didn't know how\nFascinating Wanda really we're going to be right back with a wand about\nI'd say yeah [noise]\nThat's psychic and Hitler [noise]\nAnd we will continue\nOn the matter of a heart [noise]\n\nEnd up having been talk of Lebanon hundred KFI max\nIt's time to get ready for emotional will be listening every Wednesday and nine PM Ms Carol Olivia friends help you hear yourself from past wounds and open\nThe window of density for a special and unique life healing stories that bring awareness to our hearts of course it's the matter of the heart every Wednesday at nine pm with Carol Olivia and just like Dr Bernie Segal heal your heart kill yourself listen to the matter of the heart every\nWednesday nine pm on independent talk eleven hundred K. up an ex\nListen love learn it's time to be healed\nEagle pathway would like to invite you did there and you know a thing\nOn November ten and twelve PM hosted by being married\nBenefited me admission is three feet you know slap\nThe paintings in children's activities as well as a boy and future for Arizona last year you may be family\nEgo halfway satellites that ego pathway dot org\nBrand new on the valleys independent talk radio stations Bruce Nixon show tune into the most intellectually provocative radio broadcast in years to remind them conversations have consequences as\nMyself and get unpack issues that matter most live from the life of coffee radio studios the trees are mapping Phoenix the sixty shows delivers on a promise to get you off\nOn the great stars do miss the\nShow Tuesdays at Ninety I'm right here I Am eleven hundred the valleys independence talk radio stations\nThe ... what do we need to be\nOver and over again why usually following the plan and so they took that and they trained us to believe that our life was go to school will get a job save your money four one K.

broke through Roman broke the nation and a half would you like to be a little little history\nNow do you find that offensive that I'm calling illegal aliens like this the army's this army of young men\nBarbarians\nHow do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them\nWhy do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work\nWhy do you assume that in a mob a Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealers no right but snow killers know gang members why would you assume that there'll be a logical so less of both agree let's all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand\nA small percentage are bad people very bad people of the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races so why would you want to bring in people like that to your country

if I had a podcast right now which is what you'll get come January I wouldn't cut it off but let's go back to ancient Rome together and let's see what happened in the early history of Rome\nWhen the barbarians broke the empire into and how did that happen\nHappen that the Romans couldn't defend their their borders which will call their frontiers\nHow did it happen that they broke through\nWell and it's just I told you the whole story ready they broke through what more do you need to know I get the whole story that you'll get bored I Know you tuned out already in the age of Twitter\nAnd sound bites the minute I said history you went to sleep\nYou turned on either um the nail gun\nOr a something that's a little you know small sound body\nAnd so how did the barbarians break the Roman empire into into east and west\nAs I describe in stock mass hysteria and as I described to you before on this program\nIt began and the third century of the Roman empire which was listening very important for you to hear the ... the empire and the third century was already decaying socially\nAnd disintegrating Marley wow does that sound like doesn't a gym does it sound like today\nAt that time in Rome was already decaying socially and disintegrating merrily\nAnd then they face the barbarians\nOn their borders\nAnd again it's just what happened next well all on the imperial frontier\nWhich ran roughly along the Rhine and down your enemies will now pressing against the Roman borders\nThe Franks and other German tribes had come up to the right\nIn North Hungary where the vandals and what was once that Syria and is now Romania live is a Godzilla west Scott's\nBehind those in South Russia where the east guts or I forgot ... and beyond those in the vulgar region where the lands\nAnd then there with the Mongolian people's forcing their way towards Europe so history is repeating itself let's go to graduate school together in thought for a minute\nWho do you blame how about both parties you want to talk about both parties or cashing in on the on the illegal aliens\nFor the last twenty five to Thirty years you'll have to spell it out for you why do you think that the Congress is doing nothing why do you think Trump won the election because we want something done and he said he would do it that's far he hasn't so you can blame anybody you want\nTo me it looks like the Mariel boat invasion of Miami of the early eighties\nAnd we're asking that Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador empty the prison and then not houses because if you look at the pictures\nThat are so plain and the picture is worth ten thousand words they're young strapping young men by and large with a few you know in the front women with carriages thrown in for a fact so that Jake Tapper can a\nYankee or guilt chain and Wolf Blitzer can chime in and say hey that's racist\nBut we all know what this is it's an invasion\n... for the last twenty five to Thirty years you'll have to spell

an existential problem what are we going to do about it I'm not just saying because of the current or it I mean I read existential isn't by soccer and as a a girlfriend so I Know ... the wonderful phrase is an existential threat was originally used here in politics by Netanyahu with regard to Israel\nA number of years ago when he said it's an existential threat to the survival of Israel and then everyone picked up on it but this was a true a truly an existential threat to our borders language and culture so the question is why is nothing being done\nI don't see anything done nothing

ruining the day that you made those comments not too long ago saying that civility is only going to return when Democrats are given the reins of power again welcome back to the Lars Larson shows so many reactions today\nFor these devices that have arrived in the mail to George Soros to the Clintons to the Obamas to John Brennan\nThe Debbie Wasserman Schultz and perhaps that was an accident we don't know her name was on the return address\nBut I thought we'd find out more about where these bombs might have come from she booed choose a visiting fellow at the Davis Institute\nFor foreign policy and national security and a retired army special forces officer and the top Pentagon official as Steve thanks for your service to America in uniform and thanks for taking the time denied\nSure thing thanks for having me back on the show so tell me this do you have do we have any ... uh from what we know today about these these devices that were delivered earlier today and discovered or where they might be coming from or what they might be motivated by\nA well we the public don't have any idea 'cause we don't have the\nYou know the post marks and all that stuff to do look at it and a safer I I'll be willing to bet that the FBI and the secret service are probably\nClosing in on whoever sent these devices because\nUsing the males to do this sort of thing leaves a lot of trails a lot more than most people realize\nA and you know not everybody is what he has the Unabomber was stay out there as long as he did uh most of these folks get caught pretty quickly so I I think while we don't know yet because Evan announced any of it properly uh I think there there probably are\nOn the trail of whoever did this\nAnd I would expect that is true true and while I'm not an expert on crime scene investigation and things like that uh\nYou know the post marks and all that stuff to to look at and and decipher I'll be willing to bet that the FBI and the secret service are probably\nClosing in on whoever sent these devices because\nUsing as the males to do this sort of thing leaves a lot of travels a lot more than most people realize\nI and you know not everybody is as lucky as the Unabomber was stay out there as long as he did uh most of these folks get caught pretty quickly so I I think while we don't know yet because they haven't announced any of it properly uh I think there there probably are\nOn the trail of whoever did this\nI Would expect that's true too and while I'm not an expert on crime scene investigation and things like that\nOver the years I've read too many stories about folks who built explosive devices and they tend to leave all kinds of\nOf evidence inside of them whether it's DNA whether it's fingerprints\nWhether it's just the source of the materials that they're able to track down\nUnless you're very careful as a bomb maker I Would imagine you're going to leave those kinds of hints and clues that might take up and this is clearly going to be the focus of a lot of Americans you know law enforcement uh until this is solved\nA that that I I think you're right they are going to track this back to the person who sent them I'm kinda curious about whether or not you think at this point we could even make an educated guess about what might be motivating and\nSince these devices arrived a exclusively at the addresses of of prominent Democrats and liberal politicians in America we initially heard a report that there were devices send to the White House that was quickly pulled back and it was it exclusively the Soros Clinton's Obama's John Brennan of\nWho I think would probably resist any kind of titled but I think I could call it a you know a a a tool of the left at this point um\nThat that because they were sent a Democrat you might think well then the source must have been conservative but it could also be uh something designed to bring some kind of sympathy were fold flag\nAnd I don't ordinarily believe unfolds flags as we are less than two weeks before an election\n[noise] yeah I I think you're right I mean in the same way that you know when that guy shot up the Republican\nHouse softball teams practice it was highly likely that that person who's going to turn out to somebody if he didn't like Republicans are and as it turned out that was the case\nOr in this case I think that's the first to false position is obviously this is somebody who is not particularly enamored to people with strong liberal leanings and or people that are overly critical of President Trump but we can't really make that determination until\nWe get other corroborating evidence that says that I you know the fact that not one of the devices\nWent off they were all discovered I couldn't tell you maybe they weren't intended to go off maybe this was a false flag we don't know uh you know fortunately looking at the pictures that I've seen is a devices and we're not exactly\nYou know rocket science kind of a formation and it was they were pretty crude as one of my colleagues Jim ... said today that\nThe picture of the passage of the bomb will probably go down in in some FBI class and\nThis is what a pipe bomb in the mail will look like it was you know that kind of obvious that that there was something there has to do more investigation on but we won't now and we shouldn't really make any to\nDraw any conclusions into law enforcement finishes his investigation\nThe devices went off they were you know all discovered I couldn't tell you maybe they weren't intended to go off maybe this was a false flag we don't know uh you know fortunately looking at the pictures that I've seen is a devices that we're not exactly\nYou know rocket science kind of a formation and it was they were pretty crude as one of my colleagues Jim ... said today that\nThe picture of the passage of the bomb will probably go down in in some FBI class and\nThis is what a pipe bomb in the mail will look like it was you know that kind of obvious that that there was something there has to do more investigation on but we won't know and we shouldn't really make any to draw any conclusions\nInto law enforcement finishes his investigation and we find out what the real motivation of whoever did this was\nYou know Steve you had the same reaction I did when I saw that sort of crumbled a manila envelope ... and and you know that putting a pipe inside of that before anybody even open to\nYour immediately going to wonder what is very have really feels like a steel pipe inside of an envelope maybe in addition to not intending for them to go off you wanted them to be discovered fairly early\nWhereas I have a couple of boxes sitting on my studio desk right now that are from Amazon Prime I don't even know what's inside of them and\nOccasionally my wife orders and things that are particularly heavy but if they're packed inside the box I don't know what's in there and you can see it from the outside you'd think if somebody would wanted\nA bomb to make itself make its way all the way inside somebody's office packing it that way would would uh you know would actually conceal it but if you wanted it to be discovered early on before and we all know the pipe bombs can go off inadvertently\nMaybe would package it exactly that way so that it would be immediately recognized as a suspicious package\nYeah and they you know one of the things we need to wait for is the you know the FBI\nInvestigation as a device itself because they'll be able to tell a lot from that you know did they intend for it to go off what it is operated the way they thought it would or would it be something like that bomb that was in the trunk of the car in times square\nWhere the guy who thought he had made a really effective big bombing you know he just fail we couldn't follow the Internet instructions or you know so we'll we'll have to say about that and then as we talked about the other forensic clues that should be in there that now you know I'll be honest with you I'm surprised the post office males those\nBecause they're usually pretty good right when you step up to the counter asking all those questions\nSealing the thing you know and if you don't give them legitimate answers\nThat gives them a feeling of comfort that they will mail is ... and and this kind of look like something suspicious in the passage to me that you know hindsight's always twenty twenty so we'll we'll see where it goes but uh it's a little early to draw conclusions\nAre and attach political motivation to it but now it it sure looks like there's some politics involved on one side or the other\nI Would think so too and Steve I've had that same problem when you have to convince the post office it's not a bottle of whiskey or sending to a friend but actually a bottle of olive oil you know and if you can't be convincing they're now they're not going to and neither is FedEx either they won't take it either\nYeah I mean when my son was deployed in Iraq he needed some batteries for his high speed flashlight or that he couldn't get in the little PXs over there and you're not supposed to mail batteries\nKind of look like something suspicious in the package to me that you know hindsight's always twenty twenty so we'll we'll see where those but uh it's a little early to draw conclusions\nAnd attach political motivation to it but now it sure looks like there's some politics involved one side or the\nI Would think so too and Steve I've had that same problem when you have to convince the post office it's not a bottle of whiskey or sending to a friend but actually a bottle of olive oil you know if you can't be convincing [laughter] they're ... they're not going to end neither is FedEx either they won't take it either\nYeah I mean when my son was deployed in Iraq ... some batteries for his high speed flashlight or that he couldn't get in the little the ashes over there and you're not supposed to nail\nBatteries to people so I I'll and this maybe I'm an announcer on your tax battery inside a bag of them in there\nYou don't know what's inside one of those Amazon boxes and believe me she has ordered some incredibly heavy stuff\nFrom time to time and there's and there's also the stuff where it feels like it's a box full of air so ... you know if you wanted to really conceal it you would have concealed it inside of bubble wrap inside a box you would've taped it shot you you you might have even ... copied\nSome of the markings of a UPS box or an Amazon Prime box but\nIf you act like if you package you did if you went to all that effort to build these things and then packaged it in a way that anybody who picks up a manila envelope that feels like it has a pipe in it and his and immediately suspicious I'd be amazed I think they were designed to be based on the way they look they were designed to be on it\nOr if you look at the beer so pay for for terrorism is and the other that's what's in the textbook that are well up is what is the end the textbook really missing as is the U.S is is the big cut and paste letters like a ...

I'd be stepping away it's this to the same things that always amazes me when people say I came home and found the front door my house\nUnlocked and I knew were allotted or broken into and I decided to go in and see what was going on look I'm no coward but I think it would and wouldn't be sensible to do that\nIf you find your house broken into you step back\nWalk away and called the police and if you find the bomb in your office\nYou step back tell everybody else to leave and you called the police and you get out of the way and you probably don't fire up your cell phone near the possible bomb you know you you leave and and you're right that it does seem odd that what amounts to evidence would be so quickly disseminated to the public\nUnless of course I mean and the the same thing that struck me that when Cuomo the governor of New York\nDecided about two or three hours ago to to go out and deploy a hundred national\nGuard to the streets of New York the part of that that doesn't make

is being made to look\nLike something that is aimed at\nThe left from the right let me tell you I think I don't use the term very often in fact one of my colleagues who does a different kind of talk radio show Clyde Lewis said you didn't actually use the term folds flag did you and I said yeah I sure did and here's why\nOrdinarily I've heard people have false flag theories about all kinds of incidents that actually happened this one sounds like\nAn attempt to try to bring sympathy\nOn the Democratic party the Democratic party and the last week or so is already began to signal that they don't think they're going to get the big blue wave in November on the sex they don't even think they are going to get a small blue wave they in may in fact be completely humiliated on election day so what would bring some sympathy to them\nAnything that made it look as though they were under attack from the right\nI think we're going to find out that these pipe bombs that were delivered were fakes that is the\nFBI says that they contain real explosives inside of real metal pipes but let me point out ... a couple of things that some of you have noticed number one they're delivered by the u._s. mail and delivering anything by the u._s. mail is going to leave all kinds of trails behind it\nWe asked him these waters are safe and cleaned for the most part you know and no one's a problem when we can do something about the I didn't want me because I'm Eric I can help us get started\nFrom during clean ups with friends too simple water quality tests designed for volunteers like you in the league

be outdoors [noise] enjoying local streams and rivers\nWe asked him these waters are speaking clean for the most part you know no one is a problem when we can do something about the I don't want me 'cause I'm Eric I can help us get started\nFrom during clean maps with friends too simple water quality pat sign for volunteers [noise] like you and me not only has been helping volunteers sign on the water quality problems for almost\nTwo years with simple to produce results you can go to pat dreams for ... trying to get your friends and neighbors and on and to protect streams where we enjoy the outdoors and to get started I gather you are a dot O. R. G. slash radio\nThat I that what you are a dot O. R. G. slash radio [noise]\n\nEver underestimate your joined by friday's from Lebanon new here on independence talk eleven hundred camping acts sponsored by Capitol by Toyota is a fresh take on news by poachers towards a bit about the valley there's usually a minority of our furnished from all over the afternoon have dessert person\nA day of\nAlex Jones your door and I wonder if ...\nIndependent on Lebanon during a of an accidental\n[noise]\n\nFrom a large large shows it's a pleasure to be with you on a Wednesday night and we always look forward\nTo visiting with our tax bird Brian Westbrook who is a member of the apple called to some extent and I want you to admit it right now on a national radio show did your poor little Mac or just die on you\nBrian see now I don't think he's there at all and I'll tell you what a why\nDon't you check in with him so you weren't as I get we were going to talk to him by Skype we usually talk to Brian ... guide but in this case to the looks like his computer died on him or so but that's what happens when you buy the hyper expense of apple products\nInstead of going for something that actually works anyway welcome back to the Lars Larson Joe pleasure to be with you and ... and Brian is not there I'm going to go to a ... we always putting ... to the editor line Paula's on the line in Pennsylvania St Paul welcome to the program what's on your mind tonight\nThank you for being as responsible and not as derogatory or as some other people are so I think you'd do a really good job and your logic is a fantastic thank you and so there's all that good stuff and I mean it\nYou're a pleasure to listen to I don't always agree with you know my point is simply this and I could give you ... and I hope I have a chance to do that there are quite a few on the extreme right\nFor an example and back at two thousand one of the retail is being done in Florida\nAt a customer my store this at all those Democrats they keep breaking in and you know that that stuff and I said yeah I watch television last night and the door to the county room was bashed in and you can't get over screaming yelling and waving your arms and anger and stop the boats stop the vote and I said oh they were Republicans\nWeren't day and you shouldn't my point was not that the laptop is better for the right is better the extremists that woman that held up\nThe job and your logic is a fantastic thank you and so there's all that good stuff and I mean it you're a pleasure to listen to I don't always agree with you know my point is simply this and I could give you a ... and I hope I have a chance to do that\nThere are quite a few on the extreme right\nFor an example of the back of two thousand and one of the recall is being done in Florida\nHad a customer my store that said oh those Democrats they keep raking and and you know that that that stuff and I said yeah I watch television last night and the door to the county room was bashed in and can't people that were screaming yelling and waving their arms and anger and stop the boat stop the vote and I said oh they were Republicans\nWeren't saying these are my point was not that the left is better for the right is better the extremists that woman that held up the\n... they separate head of the president I miss disgusted about her as probably any conservative would be and\nI'm disgusted about the neo Nazis in Virginia that that you know the the uh the the ranting and raving and there was the editor of even for a man drove from California to incite rioting and a woman that was peaceably walking along\nHere ... you're trying to run out the clock on me I think you know so and unfortunately\nIf if you if you want to go back twenty or Thirty years we can actually go back a hundred and fifty years and say how most of the assassinations and attempted assassination spend the work of liberals and the answer would be yes and I could give your chapter and verse on that if you want to go more recently\nWhat we could say is well let's see has Hillary Clinton said you will not get a return to civility until you give us power back as antifa marched in the streets and they benefit the left have we seen black lives matter commit acts\nOf violence trying to burn whole towns down\nGuns have been fired people have been hurt\nA and that is the lemon and then you've got to occupy and they have been\nYou know both gross and disgusting and violent as well over the years and all of those things are coming from the left\nAnd all I Would like it and you know Steve ... very nearly died because of a left wing Bernie Sanders supporter a who was a lefty who was angry and decided to shoot a bunch of Republicans hand you've seen people like Eric Holder encourage violence Maxine Waters encourage violence\nHillary as I said he encourages violence so we you know when you tell me oh there's a little bit on both sides I hear that kind of moral equivalency from reporters who don't have the guts to say\nOne side has identified itself with violent protests far more than the other side most ... in fact when Republicans call me or conservatives called me and they say\nHey let's go on to have a protest unless yell and scream and\nYou know carry signs and and and all that I'd say that's that's not the way conservatives act we are conservative we're out of left the left\nDoes that they'll go out and you know remember the day after the inauguration the big women's march where\nVehicles are set on fire people whereas a salted bad things happen to have you ever seen conservatives in America do that now I'm not going to say there aren't as individual conservatives who will throw upon you or maybe try and push down a door but I'm saying for the most part\nThe big protest some conservatives like Tea Party protests\nAre peaceful there well ordered and they usually leave the place cleaner than it was when they arrived\nWhereas when the left shows up you can usually count on broken windows people insulted and you saw all the assaults on Donald Trump supporters through the entire campaign when people would show up an event there was not their event\nThey would they were there not to listen and maybe pick apart what the candidate was\nThe left does to they'll go out and you know remember the day after the inauguration the big women's march\nWhere vehicles are set on fire people whereas a salted\nBad things happen to have you ever seen conservatives in America do that now I'm not going to say there aren't as individual conservatives who will throw upon or maybe try and push down our door but I'm saying for the most part the big protest some conservatives like Tea Party protests\nAre peaceful there well ordered and they usually leave the place cleaner than it was when they arrived whereas when the left shows up you can usually count on broken windows people insulted and you saw all the assaults on Donald Trump supporters through the entire campaign when people would show up an an event that was not their event\nThey would they were there not to listen and maybe pick apart what the candidate was saying I think that's legitimate I go to liberal or you know speeches on occasion so that I couldn't hear what they're saying\nBut I don't see the kind of behavior by conservatives that I see that comes from the left\nDo you see any examples of that like what does it what does the president who am I ... and I'm looking at the guy he said several things during the campaign police don't be so so kind to the president's both they're hedging input and then he said\nWell ... ... exactly but Paul at some point in words are turned into actions or they're not you you and and I know that that is true in both sides there are people who say that guy makes me so mad I Want to kill him have you ever heard on a friend of yours say that\nYes Sunday and have they ever killed anyone your friends and they'll\nShow there are so here's the difference there is a a wide difference usually between what people say and what people actually do but when people actually do those things when they show up at political rallies\nAnd say this isn't even my rally it's not my candidate I'm going to show up and I'm going to disrupt it so that nobody can speak and by the way when you see hearings on Capitol Hill and the left doesn't like what's going on in the hearing they show up and tried to disrupt the event you see conservatives doing that\n[noise] um I I think if you if if you're willing to do it get the Southern Poverty law that\nThat bond that bunches morally bankrupt and they don't tell the truth they might have at\nOne point out is that what evidence do you out of\nBecause I've seen and I know some of the groups I've covered some of the groups that they have labeled as hate groups they labeled as hate groups any group that doesn't agree with them politically which is very it's\nIt's a kind of political bigotry it's the kind of thing that if you're at work and there's a guy at work you don't like and he's against the best idea you've ever heard and or your bond is ever hurting his life and you say that guy's fat\nOr that guy's staying where he doesn't take a shower or you know or you know his ... you know he smells like arm pet all the ... you say well what about his idea oh it doesn't matter he's fat\n... it's the political bigotry where you say none of the the ideas coming from that person or any good I'm telling you that when I've seen hearings on Capitol Hill I have yet to see one where conservatives show up\nAnd they say oh we don't we don't like the content of this hearing so we're going to disrupt it that is almost exclusively an activity of the left and the protests the mass protests from the women's march to the Occupy to black lives matter to antifa are all from\nThe left there usually all potentially violent some kind some cases actually violent people get hurt things get burned down things get broken you can't Brian is too conservative incidence of the same time\nThe shower or you know or you know his ... he smells like arm pedaled as you say well what about his idea oh it doesn't matter he's fat\n... ... it's the political bigotry where you say ... none of those the ideas coming from that person or any good I'm telling you that one I've seen hearings on Capitol Hill I have yet to see one where conservative show up\nAnd they say oh we don't we don't like the content of this hearing so we're going to disrupt it that is almost exclusively an activity of the left and the protests the mass protests from the women's march to the Occupy\nTo black lives matter to antifa are all from\nThe left there usually all potentially violent some kind some cases actually violent people get hurt things get burned down things get broken you can't write too conservative incidence of the same time Kenya\nWhile a neo Nazis identify with the right and the skin\nNeal listen you've got to remember you don't want to not see is that the national socialist party it was invented by Adolf Hitler\nYou know and and yeah but it was the socialist at all yeah yes it was if you took a look at Germany's economy it was very much socialist state said the states controls everything and you will produce for the state\nFlowers but I don't want the government coming in to tell me I have to give up my plan and throw me oh this will be better for you Bernie Sanders says I don't trust this guy and you know like most Americans I think all hours believes that\nIt would be a good thing to cover you know Americans said every American citizen depending and don't you know regardless of their income for help\nYou know for health expenditures for you know major or health problems that they might have I think most Americans believe that but and and most fair to say well you have a system to provide the benefits to them but Americans don't want to give up their own health insurance you know the Ninety percent of us health insurance we all want to ruin Arnold plant\nYou know so that ... percent or don't have healthcare get it just getting in the healthcare voucher and let them go out and shop for health care you know that's the way I feel that the veterans you know you mentioned the veterans plant you I experienced the same thing some of the veterans say to me you know I get good health\nCoverage from the vet DAS but all we have lots of read right down the street from where I live that's one of the finest hospitals in the world\nBut other veterans say I I you know get lousy care so why not give every veteran a an opportunity if they don't want to go to the VA hospital they go to another hospital well I'm a choice guy if the Democrats don't believe in choice they believe that forcing you into the health care that they want to give you\nYou know what I'd like to do I want to make a proposal I Want to I Want the government is far out of health care as we can possibly do while still now here's what I Do in place Steve to piece it first of all let's deal with the pre existing condition\nYou know ruin Arnold plant you know so that ... percent or don't have healthcare get it just getting in the healthcare voucher and let them go out and shop for health care you know that's the way I feel that the interests of you know you mentioned the veterans plant you I experienced the same thing some of the veterans say to me you know I get good health\nCoverage from the vet DAS but all\nWe have Walter Reed right down the street from where I live that's one of the finest hospitals in the world but other veterans say I I you know get lousy care so why not give every veteran a an opportunity if they don't want to go to the VA hospital they go to another hospital well I'm a choice guy but the Democrats don't believe in choice they believe that forcing you into the health care that they want to give you\nYou know what I'd like to do I want to make a proposal I Want to I Want the government is far out of health care as we can possibly do while still now here's what I Do in place Steve to piece it\nFirst of all let's deal with the pre existing condition crowd which is about somewhere between two hundred thousand maybe a high end of\nFour hundred thousand people because we know those numbers because of the people who signed up for Obamacare with preexisting conditions when they wiped out all the risk pools so those two hundred thousand people could be covered as I understand the numbers for maybe ten Fifteen\nBillion dollars out of eight or ... thousand\nBillion dollar federal budget I like saying four thousand billion while they were saying that if you made four thousand bucks a month could you afford Fifteen\nBucks for this black people would say or for the you know forty thousand bucks a year could you afford a hundred and fifty dollars for this just to make the math easy\nThen I go sure so that's part one just cover everybody with a preexisting condition who has ... let's say wealth blow up a million bucks or half a million bucks and in some below I don't know a hundred thousand dollars yeah if you're over a hundred thousand you got to take care of yourself second\nWhat I'd like to do is have the government say we will\n... define what a good catastrophic plan is because this is the second group is all of us you have to realize I get hit by a truck and or you know I get hit by heart attack and I need a hundred and fifty thousand dollar operation if I don't have health care and I do um then I Need to have that bypass covered or the trans fat governor whatever your kid\nNeeds a new kidney okay we'll take care of it but we'll take care of it by saying we will offer a catastrophic plan for those people who want to go up ... actively bear they're not going to have any insurance except catastrophic\nAnd they say it's like you know the having having a a collusion insurance on homeowners insurance homeowner's insurance they ... out and burns\nDown I don't want to see even on homeowners I bumped my deductible from a thousand five thousand because they said why my wife said well why are you well for house burned down\nA then we have to cover the first five thousand not not a big deal if your house burned down\nYou know five thousand bucks but those the chance of that is very low and the savings by going to that it gives you a really low premium so you do those two things but you don't have the government provided you say to the insurance industry develop this product and if you meet the criteria so we can tell people that has the good housekeeping that Donald Trump seal of approval on and\nThen pick from one of the news and the and all of these companies will compete with each other saying we have a better one and it's only forty dollars a month and literally where I could get to premiums like that couldn't we\nThink of it this way whatever they said you know McDonalds is the best restaurants\nIn the fast food restaurant so we don't need all these other\nBastard right that's right we do the Burger King we'd alright advisory yeah every can just go to McDonalds well first of all what do you think would happen to the quality of food at as an adult if they hit ... right ... chick on\nHealthcare incidentally you know the Medicare I don't have to remind you this but some of your listeners may need to be reminded Medicare is now facing something like\nThirty trillion dollars of unfunded liabilities so really\nSo we can tell people it has the good housekeeping the Donald Trump seal of approval on and then pick from one of the news and the the and all of these companies will compete with each other saying we have a better one and it's only forty dollars a month and literally wept could get to premiums like that couldn't we\nThink of it this way but at least that you know what McDonald's was the best restaurants\nIn the you know fast food restaurant so we don't need all these other\nBastard right that's right you know they can't wait I advise everybody can just go to McDonalds well first of all what do you think would happen to the quality of food at all that they didn't ... right that's the logic on\nHealthcare it should definitely you know the Medicare I don't have to remind you this but some of your listeners may need to be reminded Medicare is now facing something like\nThirty trillion dollars of unfunded liabilities so we're really going to put every inch in which it's like putting every American landed back to the idea that right I mean you know it's already gone bankrupt among other hundred and fifty million people I knew it no\nIt makes no sense whatsoever Steve is a pleasure to have you on the program always and congratulations and I should give credit to Dr Laffer\nAlthough I think sometimes the short change\n... short changes Arthur because he figures laugh around the Laffer curve you already got all the attention you've already getting ready to go down in history and it's time for Steve more to get the credit so Arthur get second building on Trump mix inside or ... give my best to Dr Laffer because\nI Love explaining the

there's an exact script and I agree with you know\nThis is extreme desperation like you're a smart cookie what are you seeing\nAnd one of the former ah challenges functions I Know you work closely with uh what are they thinking right now what are they saying\nMy my greatest concern right now this caravan\nThat's headed for the U.S border I've I've wondered from day one what's the point of this caravan or the Democrats so stupid that they think\nThat having hordes of people are at the gates you know at the border of America would somehow help them win elections because I think the American people reject that the American people want to protect their border so it it it it occurred to me this morning\nThat their plan maybe and again I pray for these people I pray for their safety I don't want to see any kind of violence happen\nAgain when you actually two days ago and you said you're going to pull false flag on the camera man and and kill a bunch of them and blame I'm much\nThat's that's that's exactly right it's just it's just reinforce this morning but I I think that if they bomb if the global is the same people who are sending any bombs on CNN if they bombed the caravan or if they shoot up the caravan then and they have CNN cameras there just like they had to CNN camera in an elevator with Jeff Flake or they will have the cameras there they'll have the blood remember every false flag\nThat to to sway the political was actually\nThey need they need blood on camera I mean let's be honest that's what they look for that's what they plan and this is how they could pull it off and it saddens me so much to even have to bring up this this could be a possibility you know Alex I mean the whole reason why you want to warn people\nIt it's not to get people afraid but rather to prevent these kinds of attacks\nAnd we do want to get them afraid of letting the global is pull this off that's a big win not trying to scare you would ditch\nLadies and gentlemen they funded the Arab Spring they funded everything these global is your cold blooded they've been losing in every level and they're desperate and how obvious doesn't have to get when it's coming out the ... just finding the caravan it's in the news it's coming out and learning and then and then now he gets mail to bomb and Sean is blaming Trump\nThat can be directing the this caravan into a kill zone and the kill zone could be it could be a they're being shot from helicopters in a nighttime helicopter raid\nThat can't get any nobody has any video footage so they just blame it on America\nOr it could be a global list the plant a bomb inside the caravan who knows what it could be but I think they're paying these people leading them into a trap so they can steal the mid term election they they don't care how many people they killed this is a sad thing is global us they they'd so desperately seek power they will commit violence they will commit terrorism\nThey will blame innocent people they will murder innocent people we've seen this throughout throughout American history how desperate they are for power they'll do anything and so\nWe must spread the the alarm because the the bigger pushback that we have the more people stand up and say we know this was a false flag than the greater the safety of all those people will be because maybe the global us will back off it back off if they think it won't work so our\nVoices right now can help save lives against these false like terrorists think about that\nNo I agree and in fact when I update ... videos from us live feed impulsive

Obama\nUh then it goes to the former attorney general then it goes uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz then it goes on down critic Cuomo dot supposedly sent a bomb and show all the little darling who'd been under attack Cuomo saying America was never that great\nAmerica isn't great it's not going to be great all this anti American crap showing their global showing they're not Americans they hate Americans all of the people that are on the roads\nAre getting the the bombs in the mail so they can make the victims and one of ... and now runs his empire say\nHe says\nYou're rhetoric Trump hurting me stop your speech is bad you're hurting me when he finds dancing for that little monster\nWell the the Democrats are of course experts in victim hood this is what they teach young students in college today how to be a victim rather than how to be a someone who contribute to society or how how to think like a victim instead of thinking like a winner\nAnd this is why they hate Trump so much because Trump as a winter and his policies are winning policies and he's helping America when again\nThe Democrats want to tear down America they want to destroy the economy they want to destroy the free market system\nThey want to release prisoners and shut down the prisons are destroyed any border protection and just literally invaded the country you know all this but the thing is\nThey are willing to bomb and murder and mayhem people in order to accomplish their political goals is the very definition of domestic terrorism\nAnd we see it clearly we've seen it for months I mean maybe more than a year we've seen it I think more and more of the American people see it as well and I think that right now this early voting surge that we are seeing across America as being reported

I kind of believe a lot of things like you do\nI think it's going to get worse before it gets better for me and if we don't for our heads were all in trouble\nA great good call I agree the problem is here's the problem\nThis country is so much more divided than we all know\nThree one two six for two fifty six hundred\nWho's to blame you've got everybody on the left blaming President Trump for what happened today\nI just I just don't buy that one I owed a let me go to a Tony hey Tony around with Joe\nHey Joe you know my first instinct this morning was you know I wanted to jump on the bandwagon of false flag and all that\nBut then thinking it through in order to do that you have to assume that motives for this individual your last caller had it right I think it will get worse and here's the thing I Do think that Trump tactics um whether I agree with them or not\nI think you can put some blame on that they're saying that you can put blame I Maxine Waters and the things that she goes out says and assuming the motives of others and then acting on that is a tactic of the ... that's generally what you ... you know you can\nSay you see that on that side um for example a identity politics in order to claim something as hate speech or or to say that you know\nWhite privilege this or anything along those lines you have to assume the motives of the individual before the factor in in that you know we didn't want to make any assumptions before the extra for cabinet and I think we shouldn't make any has something\nTo you know Tony ... play this out for me I I'm trying to understand what you're saying 'cause it's interesting\nShow if if if you've got Trump out there ... month after month calling the media the enemy and the people and then some madman grabs a gun and shoots a member of the media\nBecause he can't stand the media because they're the enemy of the people are does Donald Trump have any blame for what that Mad Men did\nWell I'm sure they that argument could be made that is to blame but the point is\nYou know when you play it out you know what your last caller said is exactly right that's what the ... the the the justice system is therefore is to work on his kinks out and quick and take it down to the level of the individual you know rhetoric is rhetoric and if people can't handle it you shouldn't get involved\nIn a good call Tony no in in your right nothing comes right there with you look you know I and I've said from the beginning I don't like it when Trump calls the meeting the enemy of the people I think it's dangerous and I don't I don't think it makes sense but if you got Trump out there on the media the enemy of the people\nAnd then some guy grabs a gun and shoots a member of the media um the guy who grabbed the gun and shot a member of the media he's responsible for that and he\nMad Men did well I'm sure they that argument could be made that is to blame but the point is you know when you play it out you know what your last caller said is exactly right that's what the ... the the the justice system is there for is to work on a host kinks out and quicker\nAnd take it down to the level of the individual you know rhetoric is rhetoric and if people can't handle it you shouldn't get involved\nAnd good called Tony no in in your right nothing comes right there with you look you know I and I've said from the beginning I don't like it when Trump calls the meeting the enemy of the people I think it's dangerous and I don't I don't think it makes sense but if you got Trump out there on the media the enemy of the people\nAnd then some guy grabs a gun and shoots a member of the media um the guy who grabbed the gun and shot a member of the media\nHe's responsible for that and he's going to pay a price for that there is a big difference between Donald Trump saying the media is the enemy the people or Donald Trump saying hey come on everybody grab your gun ghost shoot a member of the media\nIf Donald Trump said that at one of his rallies everybody needs to go shoot a member of everybody needs to go shoot somebody at CNN and then somebody shot somebody at CNN I guarantee you Donald Trump would be held liable for that as well\nBut there's a big difference\nBetween expressing an opinion\nThe media is the enemy of the people or the media sucks\nAnd the president saying go go attack a member of the media\nThere is a big big difference between that\nLet me go to Dave Dave you're on the Joe\nJoe I'm I just kind of heard about this on my way and work for the first time but\nIt's funny that none of these bombs went off\nI mean you know yeah I'm going to make 'em you think that water them or something would have went off to well you know the Democrats in the media they cause a lot of the problems you know I'm

these devices were found\nOr just to kind of be technical on that point um look we live in a divided country right now the rhetoric is heated right now I think it's going to get more heated right now\nUm and I think this is just the road we're on a I think it's imperative that we all condemn violence or as much as we can\n[noise]\nIt's time to check the freedom of choice\nThese devices were

announcement ... before we bring Dr frost on I Want out\nWhen you're when you're eighty gets one and two million\nSo why don't you a million I Do the calculations on that that's the only a half a percent of your themselves left that you begin with\nAnd um you asked your two hundred times left stems cells of what you started with now in sync about there so\nYou have to have to stem cells to grow new tissue so you've never had to shoot around or your growing in size or brain neurology intestines all you have to have the themselves to develop all that stuff so of course that makes sense why we have so many more during that time but what happens over time as they start to recycle only so many times and then they just stop\nSo we don't ... when they get older and so there was a great example and I want you examine our about a month ago and um Utah and it was from New procedures for themselves and bone spurs and how to get rid of those um and they said think about a baby that rolls down a set of stairs\nTake it up they laugh it off okay maybe they cry a little bit but they laugh it off and they have a new toy and they go and they do something else right and no big deal\nI'm Sorry but if I wrote down inside it says you better down nine one one when we're done [laughter] I'm probably be hurting the ice packs I Want to make sure everything's working and you know we don't bounce back and staff and think about an eighty\nYear old you know when when they fall or hurts themselves you know um they just don't respond as well the immune system\nTime is they start to recycle only so many times and then they just stop\nSo we don't ... when we get older and so there was a great example and I went to a seminar about a month ago and um\nUtah and it was from New procedures for themselves and bone spurs and how to get rid of those um and they said think about a baby that rolls down a set of stairs pick it up they laugh it off okay maybe they cry a little bit but they laugh it off and they grab a new toy and they go and they do something else right and no big deal\nI'm Sorry but if I rolled down instead of you better down nine one\nOne when we're done [laughter] I'm I'm probably be hurting the ice packs I Want to make sure everything's working and you know we don't bounce\nBack us down and think about an eighty year old you know when when they fall or hurt themselves you know um they just don't respond as well the immune system starts to get shut down for don't forget stem cells also go after the immune system in the immune system is designed as um operated by the nervous system\nSo when you have stem cells um and you have a lot of them you end up you end up doing much better\nYou ended up retiring better insults themselves are necessary to rebuild and regenerate issue this has been around for decades folks\nIt might be a new to you because you know we're just getting it up to the public like on the radio station\nBut it's been around for decades look back in Nineteen oh eight there was a theory that there was a cell that was a master cells that was developing those and then in ... and look at the history on the Internet there's accustomed cool stuff I'm In Nineteen sixty three they were actually starting to use that to themselves and recognizing this potential and it's a power\nAnd then in Nineteen sixty eight they actually did their vote first bone marrow transplant which is worst themselves actually are um and then in Nineteen Ninety eight to George Bush you know a a minister ration want to get an stocks\nThe study of themselves but let's clear this up there is a mess out there the myth is that themselves only come from fetuses and from embryos of abortions that is not true\nThey actually have stem cells in the em the Arctic sack\nWith which you and I grew up in okay for nine months and\nThen it's been the cord and so you have a high concentration of stem cells in these areas these are legal in the United states\nI'm back in Nineteen Ninety eight there was some bad things that were happening unfortunately people are taking advantage of money got involved I think which happens often and they had to kind of eradicate that they aren't doing it in other parts of the world\nYou know for some things that you know we're not doing here because of these ethical laws um but you know right now the stem cells that are available to you if you're having pain in your joints\nUm don't wait I've got my own small testimony was robocop neon today you know I'm I'll share that and just a minute but you know I Want you to really understand that this might not this might be new to you but it's not new to science\nAnd so when you come into the clinical you come to mind seminar on Tuesday night at six thirty\nI'm I'm gonna teach you about these things I'm going to actually sit down I'm going to\nMake sure that you are educated you make an informed choice ah with all the knowledge that you have and or take at least that next step to gather more knowledge of this is your body um uh Jennifer what kind of car are you today remember\nTalked about that yeah well right now I I did I not jaguar jaguar okay so it's All

right Jamie return what kind of ...\nBut you know I Want you all to really understand that this might not this might be new to you but it's not new to science and so when you come into the clinical you come to mind seminar on Tuesday night at six thirty I'm I'm gonna teach you about these things I'm going to actually sit down I'm going to\nMake sure that you are educated you make an informed choice ah with all the knowledge that you have and or take at least that next step to gather more knowledge look this is your body um uh Jennifer what kind of car are you today remember\nWe talked about that yeah well right now I I just I'm not jaguar jaguar okay so it's All right so it was titled I Love that [laughter] I'm gonna leave half of that alone on a solid jaguar so we're looking at a convertible\nCar so that so but do you drive at the top down I've choir okay um and All right Jamie return what kind of car you know the cause is is that your body what is your car what are you driving to the rest of your life\nYou know what [laughter] I'm having the RV hey beautiful I I I had my fiancee for Thirteen Years and it never had issues with it so I kinda liked that idea\nWell when it does let me know get a console we'll see if we can fix it okay [laughter] so I you know I'm a mouser\nRowdy convertible spider I Love that\nRight and I'm thinking with your C. R. V. I just might you know drop it down and put some wheels from twenty chews on it you know but maybe not maybe that's what you like driving so whenever you are\nAsked yourself right now what are you some people like to be a sea RV some people like to be a tank or the front line but on the football field right some people are like ... like ... or their motorcycles ... the ... is what I was thinking whatever it is you are this is only a vehicle you're going to get for lice\nDon't take it for granted look your body's going to talk to you\nWe called body language it's not crossing the arms are opening up its not leaning forward into somebody to drive a point or step back to accept some knowledge right I don't know what position you're in right now hopefully you're sitting back except the knowledge but you know its body language so when your body starts talking to you you do need to listen\nSo I'm gonna tell much joined now because I didn't listen as well as I should have I'm gonna tell on myself\nAnd six years ago I was writing the tendency mountains and\nI had a bicycle crash I was by myself and it was a ten mile ride I was about a two to four miles and and I didn't break anything everything was working right and I'm a doctor I can evaluate this right with nobody around and see if I should walk out or ride out I could ride out it was no big deal but I had a big old theme it's home or a big bruise on my entire my side\nAnd you know when I got home after right in the next six to eight miles out I was black and blue all the way from my my uh my leg attached to my body all the way down to my cats are like oh that's not good that was really dumb\nBut for the last six years I just had some nuts in my leg here trying to do some ultrasound insects and they are just must be scar tissue no big deal well apparently there was more damaging their because about two months ago my needs started kind of acting up and I've never damaged my knees in my life\nI was a wrestler was a runner all what kinds of stuff never and then about three weeks ago I could hardly get up and down stairs\nSo I wouldn't have number I'd done over valley radiologist an amazing group of people um they're very kind so if you have a choice they and smile I Love them but I went over there um and I found out that I had torn three muscles on the inside of my leg\nAnd that the inside of mine but that's gets on my knee was actually starting to fray we're starting to shreds\nAnd I'm like okay you know I Need to see the use of embryonic issue in Dr Miller phenomenal phenomenal injection of his mind that they they just passed a medical doctor for the last two years we've worked together\nI had him inject me and I've got to robocop me a new I mean I just got an e brace on in the ... races\nLee there was more damaging their because about two months ago my needs started kind of acting up and I've never damaged my knees in my life\nI was a wrestler was a runner or what kinds of stuff never and then about three weeks ago I could hardly get up and down stairs\nSo I wouldn't have number I'd done over valley radiologist an amazing group of people um they're very kind so if you have a choice they and smile I Love them but I went over there um and I found out that I had torn three muscles on the inside of my leg\nAnd that the inside of mine but that's gets on my knee was actually starting to fray we're starting to shreds\nAnd I'm like okay you know I Need to see the use of antibiotics issue in Dr Miller phenomenal phenomenal injection of sees mind that they they just passed a medical doctor for the last two years we've worked together\nI had him inject me and I've got to robocop me a new I mean I just got a knee brace on in the ... races designed to unload the inside that need so we're not working harder in order to try to rebuild under the rats and stress while I'm Still helping people in the clinic\nSo I started with body language\nSo my body was telling me something for six years but because it wasn't really detrimental I could still function and run and hike and stuff like that and ride bikes waitlist I just didn't think there was much there I didn't and I'm a doctor and I and I should've I should've done something and I didn't\nSo folks if you're not a doctor I don't think you know more either I thought I did but if you have an injury on your past and it's just even a slight something or other that means is that we sixty percent dysfunction occurring there because you don't get a symptom until that happens\nSo don't wake call the clinic called six to nine nine to two six ... there were two Ninety nine to two six five six only for healthy habits am I doing complimentary councils that rule changed last week [noise]\nOkay so make sure you mentioned that you heard me unhealthy habits Jamie Jennifer a dance tunes Terry any of the poison here told you to come see me or you heard me on the radio or just mentioned the name and it will be complementary outside of that there is a small city in order to be able to do the consultation\nAnd an examination on that area to tell you what's next where I'm going to send you or him going to help you and I'm looking forward to seeing you in the clinic\nSo just to wrap this up for everyone listening is what you're saying is do not ignore it it's not going to go away when that pain happens I'm seat somebody right away about it I mean because you can't just think oh it'll go away right\nNow without damage [laughter] right yeah yeah I mean you and you'll just get more\nDamage and more damage than when you start seeing signs listeners you know ... again mentioned healthy happen it's going to be free what do you have to lose you know\nSo yeah people say what do I have to pay all that attention [laughter] I don't really love what they're going to cost you a little bit of time yeah that's it but\nYou know there there's no money that has to come out of your pocket to find out if it's the right solution for you but look if you're already on drugs if you're already on opiates if you're trying to suppress you know the pain that's coming in\nUm please let's at least a decrease that or or get your life back um you know we're helping the military when I was when I was at the home show over Westworld this weekend was amazing\n[laughter] oh I Love what they're going to cost you a little bit of time yeah that's true but\nYou know there there's no money that has to come out of your pocket to find out if it's the right solution for you but look if you're already on drugs that you're already on opiates if you're trying to suppress you know the pain that's coming in\nI'm pleased at least ... decreed that or or get your life back um you know we're helping the military when I was when I was at the whole show over Westworld this weekend was amazing\nUm so what I Would have done is at least got out and got an MRI immediately and then if I didn't understand what I was reading um or I didn't agree with the clinical I Would call the radiologist up and say hey listen you know we need to team up\nOn this one or you're the specialist in reading this and I'm a specialist or in physical medicine than would have said okay um I Would have definitely done a clinical exam on you which I'm actually if you don't mind before we leave here today I Want to I Would like to check your shoulder out if I'm not sure okay\nAnd let's just validate now what I heard immediately was body language mhm\nNo I worked in a nursing home ... I was the head orderly\nI got to roll patience and change sheets and paid them I understand what all that means yeah and that's hard hard work and it takes a special person to do that that's why I don't do it anymore [laughter] I went into a different field 'cause I just couldn't do that\nBut you know I understand the stress on the train or what ended up happening was your body it didn't just whisper to you I'm assuming you didn't have a whisper ahead of time right now I Need it was like the child who got a little pinprick writes screen [noise]\nAnd yeah I had to listen to me 'cause this is not good that's right and the end result you were telling me earlier if I remember I was to general bones burner yes okay um and did you hear anything did you tear a labor him which is that caught lived around the edges of joint\nYou know so when they did the X ray and set the for the surgery they said they thought there was a hair yet that when they went in there and they said they didn't see its hair okay with me the phone as far as that was probably causing the pain that makes sense you know\nThat popping is not necessarily a bone spur so I write the probability of other things going on we're not going to solve on the radio today but I'm living in\nA well number one is it sounds like you're probably we're doing everything right and how to compromise issue prior to maybe if you played sports that you went through college are you grew up as a kid and had Fifteen hundred spinal dramas and shoulder troubled by the time you were Thirteen to compromise and then it finally just do it finally just reached out to you and said hey you need to pay attention to me\nThe fact that you went through everything that you did and Joe couldn't figure it out\nYour those are the kinds of patients that I actually liked to have come into my clinic because oftentimes we can help people\nThat have been through that so if it's a bone spur we do unfortunately have to tell people that there's a possibility you might have to have you know or just stop at surgery to remove that in hand with your stem cells after that in order to regenerate and rebuild that tissue because people get are are amazing results\nYou know but that ... is not necessarily a bone spur so I write the probability that some other things going on we're not going to solve on the radio today\nBut I'm living in a well number one is it sounds like you're probably we're doing everything right you had to compromise issue prior to maybe if you play sports that you went through college are you grew up as a kid and had Fifteen hundred spinal dramas and shoulder to them by the time you were Thirteen to compromise and then it finally just finally just reached out to you and said hey you need to pay attention to me\nThe fact that you went through everything that you did and still couldn't figure it out\nYour those are the kinds of patients that I actually liked to have come into my clinic because oftentimes we can help people\nThat have been through that so if it's a bone spur we do unfortunately have to tell people that there's a possibility you might have to have you know or just stop and search it just to remove that in hand with your stem cells after that in order to regenerate and rebuild that tissue because people get are amazing result\nAfter they cleaned up so I Do recommend surgery at times but it is the last result the last thing I Want to do it the oh no you're going to be fine do you know and the other issue on you\nKnow kind of growth factors and and the themselves on you\nAnd knowing that there's a bones Brennan probably aggravating and sharing tissue at the same time because from what I can see in all the studies that I have seen and done over the last two years I've only seen one person would appear that the bone spur actually started to go away I'm outside of that there's no documentation but I Know the validated that but with and talk about on another part of the program\nHow bone spurs are now starting to\nDissolve or start to go way um and it's with nutrition and I would like to talk about that and and you can filter if you have that in the store here as well but you know um\nBut I wouldn't do it yeah it's just a simple injection we would find out if there were torn muscles and which ones they were torn after doing orthopedic neurological exam\nUm being a sideline Dr semi pro football team for many years I've seen a few shoulder injuries and so it is fairly easy to figure that out but I don't have X ray vision so I Would refer out for like I said the MRI okay I'm outside of that\nBasically it's too that the two weeks of just activities of daily living then you'll do some their band\nLow tech rehab at home I Do need to see if we times a week like a physical therapist and that's not that's not necessary most people are pretty smart when I'm going to get them as we just do me a down\nYou know and just make sure that we don't yeah I like that [laughter] we all understand what we're saying you know doctors and nurses we can talk right over people [laughter] so um\nMost of the stuff is pretty simple and easy it's relatively inexpensive especially when we're talking about for our raised jaguars ...\nAnd I had a call why you guys are talking and on this is about probably but many people are thinking that they're listening to all of that ... I Know I had um we all talk about\nGosh 'cause I Know what surgery costs for talking I don't have insurance up to a hundred of thousands of dollars absolutely and fight scene you I'm sure everybody does it we're not talking hundreds of thousands\nOf dollars no no no can you give us kind of like a fall apart because that's what we all kind of want it now and I know we're not going to hold you to lay but what are we talking here as far as dollar\nSeveral thousand dollars okay yeah yeah um and it just depends on what your problems are so you know an e mail only require this but if the new shows up some of the things right or tissue them\nThat it just it costs more 'cause it's issues expensive yeah I mean you know we're talking about embryonic history coming from the centers that have to be taken from you know it's a scheduled says area Mm section so you know they have to go through the FDA process and they have it has to cost something for the questioning they have to do the blood work up to make sure there's no pathogens going and you\nThen the ATV the American association of tissue bank\nUm they are trained for this a train the persons that use a skeptic techniques to process is going from a sterile environment for the section into a sterile environment got it\nCan you give us kind of like a ballpark because that's what we all kind of want to know and I know we're not going to hold you to it but what are we talking here as far as dollar several thousand dollars okay yeah yeah um and it just depends on what your problems are so you know an e\nMail only required this but if the new shows up some other things right or to issue than the ... does it cost more because of the issues expensive yeah I mean you know we're talking about embryonic history comparable expenses and have to be taken from a you know this is scheduled to Syrian section so\nYou know they have to go through the FDA process and they have it has to cost something for the questioning they have to do the blood work up to make sure there's no pathogens going into them at a CD the American association of tissue bank\nUm they are trained for this a train persons that use age that's a technique to process is going from a sterile environment from the section into a sterile environment got it and then it has to be washed it has to be you know shift and has to end these are all done by medical personnel and or trained staff\nThat are certified to handle this with precision and an advocacy\nAnd that's all that all goes in and some fortunately it's a little expensive but let me tell you something how valuable as your shoulder\nExactly you can't really put a value on Shane Jamie How old is your shoulder pay anything for no pain [laughter] very valuable okay there I mean you can use your arm I couldn't use my arm I mean it was scary\nYeah yeah and and and you can't put a price on fear right you can't do that and it's ... and not just physically but mentally and to put you understand\nWhat I Want to really come back down to it's affordable Oh absolutely it's it's yeah they might not doing it it's not affordable you've got it is a very affordable I mean if you look at it over twelve month Perrier an Eighteen month period if some payments and stuff you know what it's worth it\nYou know for two hundred dollars a month you know for a payment plan or something like that that you put yourself on yeah it's when I'm just thrown out your you\nKnow we have ways that you can get them out at a at a zero percent\nSo we're not talking hundreds of thousands of dollars that you have to mortgage your house was don't end up selling my jaguar [laughter] or\nI might say that one for you [laughter]\nBut I don't know they wreck yeah\nSo it just so if you really you can't really put a value no no no no but I just want to put you to tell our listeners to you know you got to look at it too is you know quit going out to movies and out to eat and all of that you know and put your money back into your body to your health well\nAnd and you know what I Want to lighten up a little bit on that you know how about we just cut down going to the movies and cut down on living\nAnd going out and eating but I'm just using that as a nickname out or\nA hundred percent yeah absolutely and uh you know that's the thing is where are your priorities how fast you want to get better you know and how how much do you not want to work okay nobody really wants to work on thinking but [laughter]\nHopefully everybody's retired and we're not however what I wanted to say is there's a guy who I really wanted to call in the day and and I don't know what happened I was looking forward to hearing from ... I'm going to tell his story\nOK his name is Ken mhm he came to me a couple of years ago and he had two surgeries on one shoulder\nAnd he had three torn rotator cuff moguls not complete tears because he would have had to have another surgery if that was the case\nHe had degenerative arthritis in the joints where the shoulder bone actually is and then on top where there is what they call an eight seed join you have to generation their votes shoulders absolutely debilitating\nThe man was fifty two years old which city do for a living he did nothing for sixteen years prior oh boy he was out of work oh he was struggling in all areas of his life mhm\nHe actually worked for a large company throughout the world and he worked in the automotive area and so he was handling heavy tires region overhead oil changes\nKen mhm he came to me a couple of years ago and he had two surgeries on one shoulder\nAnd he had three torn rotator cuff moguls not complete chairs because he would have had to have another surgery if that was the case he had degenerative arthritis in the joints where the shoulder bone actually is and then on top where there is what they call an eight seed join you have to generation their votes shoulders absolutely debilitating\nThe man was fifty two years old what you do for a living he did nothing for sixteen years prior oh boy he was out of work oh he was struggling in all areas of his life and\nHe actually worked for a large company throughout the world and he worked in the automotive area and so he was handling heavy tires region overhead oil changes stuff like that could not do any of it\nAnd we were able to help him with the tissue and I believe it was about three months later he was back to full work doing anything he wanted throwing tires changing how Good Wife whatever it is and he he could do anything and that was about two years ago he and I still keep in touch wow and\nIs absolutely amazing what this can do so we talk about cost ... what does that cost him sixteen years of inactivity possibly finances you know we started out that up and\nI'm Sorry I just I just have to ask you when you come in and I will ask you how bad do you want to get better if this is the right solution for you and we will talk about time and we'll see if you can put the timing and then we'll talk about cause I'm very transparent everything's in right into my office and you get to decide what you want to do um I just want to educate you\nAfter examining you and give you some solutions and allow you the freedom to make the choice of what you'd like to do look if you want to do surgery I'm sure not going to try and prevent you from doing that this is this is our choice and I want you to have that opportunity to say no I don't have to\nSearch for a ride rather try not to do surgery like my eighty one year old patient who is now almost out of paying what's going on but I Hope it stays that way of course but uh yeah of course what's what's the cost Jamie I mean\nI Can't imagine being as young as you are and having to go through that and not be able to go water skiing or whatever it is you enjoy doing in Alabama with the oh I couldn't\nPick up my hands like grocery shopping was hard um [noise] it was yeah it was very difficult I really wish I would have known about this and and gone to a different route\nHow the house call Arizona is not popular live on a talk radio show was brought to you today by healthy habit healthy at six zero to nine north seventh street and Phoenix, Arizona\nHow the house called features that latest breakthroughs in the world of integrated and functional medicine and wellness we feature world class education for manufacturers and local practitioner you can always laying on the conversation by calling six zero two to six sects went down\nThe number all information that's got some healthy house call it's subject to your doctor's approval well you're not diagnosed ... park here or prevent any didn't always consolidation for all health concerns joined it may do friday at nine AM on chaos and acts eleven hundred than\nYou are listening to independence ... eleven hundred K.

now look at it this way\nLet's say you have a puzzle and it's a square puzzle now the block chain is like the square is the world you can make it around or whatever you want but I'm just doing an analogy here\nIn each one of the pieces ... as like a puzzle goat fits in that the block chain now inside of that block chain each one of those pieces can have a company that sets on top of it with

S. are which you know that I give you guys when you have a buyer yup it states that I have polled credit at least had a conversation I've received all of their documentation\nAnd so why don't you have all of that they're basically should be pre approved it now because as a lender I can look at their pace that I can look at their bank statements verify asked that\nBecause if I send you a pre qualification the allies are and all I put that I had a verbal conversation and pulled credit that\nThey call it a pre approval that really can't be er prequel because you're just going based on a verbal conversation and you know as real truth if I were to send you one over and it was blank of it and I pulled credit\nAnd um you got one of those I'm One of your listings that really isn't that amazing thing to correct\nExactly I mean it's all about vetting the buyer tend the buyer we're going to take this house off the market make it available to the buyer for the next thirty forty five days whatever it is can they perform\nAnd writes in this initial offering process of I just get a ... says all we had a verbal conversation and yes they can do this versus a we've vetted them we looked at their bank statements we looked at their tax returns we looked at a page Doug we look to all this stuff\nYou know and there's a couple other offers that come in and especially in the lower price points and if it does happen\nYou know which application are we going to do for\nAbsolutely and and so that's a true pre qualification when you have everything but with with my experience in other loan officers if you have\nReally I mean it's all about vetting the buyer tend the buyer we're going to take this house off the market make it available to this by her for the next thirty forty five days whatever it is can they perform\nAnd writes in this initial offering process of I just get a brick wall but says all we had a verbal conversation and yes they can do this versus a we've vetted them we looked at their bank statements we looked at their tax returns we looked at the pay stubs we look to all this stuff\nYou know and there's a couple other offers that come in and especially in the lower price points and if it does happen\nYou know which application are we going to go for\nAbsolutely and and so that's a true pre qualification when you have everything but with with my experience in other loan officers if you have all of that\nI'm not even an outlet a borrower out the door if I have any question about income let's say their self employed\nThen I ended up for an income review if it's a very difficult self employed borrower say or a truck driver that maybe gets paid per trip\nUm any type of variable income I always get a double checked but the actual pre approval is your initial approval from an underwriter\nTechnically but as inexperienced loan officer I should be able to look at that file make sure that what they tell me they make look at the hourly rate make sure the year to date income matches that make sure that W to snatch and you know and then I said I'm old fashioned I sit down with every bar or\nAn account for them and I make sure that I tell them you know don't go by any new cars\nGet any new debt don't spend your money and make sure your payments are still on time so that when you find your property we're not going to have any issues as creditor income\nYeah so there's a couple of professions out there were\nOld school you still you know the valid please who go old school is actually meeting with the clients sitting down talking their situation through understanding their situation better so you can present it in such a way that is in their best interest but his frequent letter\nAbsolutely and also determine you know whether an F ha alone is better for them if they're veteran I always\nGood at a VA\nUm combatants and all you know you really need to determine what's best for your client and I think that's just too difficult to do if everything is just up loaded through them\nYou're not going to get that on line you're not you're not going to get that kind of service and that kind of best interest I mean everybody's out there are kind of trying to get the best eighth and I appreciate that uh but\nFrom listening agents standpoint who's going to review your offers\nAnd you have a solid pre approval with ... and we know that the lender has looked at checked all these boxes ahead of time it's going to make us a lot more comfortable and that's that's a big that's a big difference especially in a market like ours\nSure and when my buyers\nPut in an offer as you know I'll get the lifting agents name and phone number and I will call\nTo them once he offers placed and explain how strongly borrowers and sometimes that help them get the contract\nNo doubt I mean this is not the sexiest side of the business but it's the most important and it's the nuts and bolts\nNBN rise has been doing it twenty five years or direct line and suburban mortgage you guys want to get pre approved at least see what the best program is you know we talk about affordability all the time there's different ways to structure your cash which could save you huge and still get you a great house or a direct line is six two\nThat checked all these boxes ahead of time it's going to make us a lot more comfortable and that's and

they offered praise and explain how strongly borrowers and sometimes that help them get the contract\nNo doubt I mean this is not the sexiest side of the business but it's the most important and it's

... two six ... six sixty seven twenty eight\nI Know you mentioned VA in ... the ... the end is an expert\nAt the VA loans and I say expert without bringing anybody who are legal bills or anything like that concern them doing this [laughter] I Know your your husband is a vet and uh we met on the opposite side of a transaction I was one of the lifting agents during the short sale period when I had to have a deal done\nOr face foreclosure the end was on the other side she deanna ties the VA loan like nobody's business and came through I think it was in probably two to three weeks because we didn't have any time to get this deal done\nAnd so I when we say that it comes from experience I I did not know who Dan was but it was her staff and professionalism or in getting the deal done her communication\nOr that really you you know that and that stuck with me so I reached out to her after that deal was over and said you know that was pretty impressive you know I I Want to be a part of that and uh\nAnd that was what I was during the height of the short sell crisis so we're talking the wild me two thousand nine so it's been a long time since then our relations has been going on so we appreciate that and a impressing upon everyone out there and if you're a real estate agent law I Know a lot of real estate agents do with the show here and there\nAnd if you're looking for a lender I

help you get the confidence and clarity\nTo your overall financial re financial retirement plan\nYou know a new study came out recently are called the real deal\nAnd it's talking about the uh suggesting that many workers may need to significantly reduce their standard of living during retirement if they retire at age six seven\nStudy finds um it's actually from a on a study the real deal they find that only one out of three workers who participate in their employers benefit plans over a full career or are expected to be able to retire with reasonably adequate retirement income\nAnd study provides insight into the overall retirement readiness of us workers with access to retirement plans based on data across nearly thirty industries\nAbout six seven percent of the u._s. workforce current us workforce has a pension so if you're one of those that do have a pension\nI'm again just like Social Security benefits you want to become educated in what those benefits are and the climate strategies if you have a spouse do you take you know a little bit less so that something happens to you your spouse continues the benefit or you were self insure yourself so you take a hundred percent\nAnd uh something happened to you you your spouse get nothing but they have a life insurance and maybe they get the same amount not reduced you know if you can structured that way but again become educated in your benefits and all the different climbing strategies and Social Security pension\nThen what's the third source it's the main source for many many people now and going forward and that's where the focus\nAbout six seven percent of the u._s. workforce crime or us workforce has a pension so if you're one of those that do have a pension\nI'm again just like Social Security benefits you want to become educated and what those benefits are in the primary strategies if you have a spouse do you take you know a little bit less so that something happens to you your spouse continues the benefit or you were self insure yourself so you take on a ... percent\nAnd uh something happened to you you your spouse get nothing but they have the life insurance and maybe they get the same amount not reduced African structured that way but again become educated in your benefits and um all the different climbing strategies and Social Security pension\nThen what's the third source it's the main source for many many people now and going forward and that's where the focus is on this retirement planning your own money you know looking at ways to structure your income from what you've said\nTransitioning your retirement income I mean your retirement savings and retirement investments train changing over transitioning that to retirement income\nYou want to try to build that strong retirement plan smarter retirement plan and look at various ideas for that income and how you're going to make that money your own money work\nAnd with that\nHave to be focusing on or be aware of the risks involved\nYou know the risks involved with taking money from your own account so a couple of things would start with so you look at it okay well what about the question what do you think the stock market or or your investments are going to do in the next ten years forget about the next year what about the next ten years there's going to be like the last ten years or is going to be something different\nThat they're going to be like back in the Nineteen Haiti or is going to be like two thousand and eight\nYou know you don't know but one thing where you do now is that you should be looking at the risk involved and we'll talk about market risk a little bit later it's happening but the risk involved of retirement income planning longevity risk is the first one\nPeople are living longer odds are people are living longer and will continue that\nAnd so you want to make sure that if that were to happen to you that you have income that will continue as long as you live and that you do not run out of income and that you do not run out of money and false hope for your spouse\nLongevity risk with longevity risk also comes the health care issues people living longer maybe they're healthy but maybe eventually there is some health care issues\nSo do you want to make sure you address or consider the possible cost of healthcare now or in the future\nBesides longevity risk this other risk is dealing with what they call the sequence of returns or the rate of return you get on your money before you retire and the rate of return to get on your money after you after you retire\nThere a return is you get on your money before you retire can have a major impact on when you actually retire and how much money you have\nThe right of return you get on your money in retirement I'll have a major impact on your income and your ability to keep the money and the account to have an income\nSequence of returns\nThinking about this and so you know the market up and down your account up and down if it goes down right before you retire you know maybe a ... and a downturn for a couple of months or year how's that going to affect your account balance you know you go back to the example of two thousand seven somebody was going to retire\nTurns or the rate of return you get on your money before you retire and the rate of return to get on your money after you after you retire\nThere a return is you get on your money before you retire can have a major impact on when you actually retire and how much money you have\nThe right of return you get on your money in retirement I'll have a major impact on your income and your ability to keep money in the account to have an income\nSequence of returns\nThinking about this and so you know the mark it up and down your account up and down if it goes down right before you retire you know maybe ... and a downturn for a couple of months or year how's that going to affect your account balance\nYou know you go back to the example of two thousand seven somebody was going to retire in two thousand eight and all of a sudden they lost thirty forty percent other four one K. money yeah maybe they had to delay their retirement and the money came back um actually but you know they and they continue to contribute but it took a while\nThe other side suppose you were were already retired for a couple of years experience some some good up turns for a while and then your investments take an income off of it everything's great\nAnd then next thing you know two thousand eight hits you lose thirty forty percent of your account value you're taking money out may be the same amount and now say you're getting double hit double whammy and now maybe taking longer for your account to recover maybe it has recovered what happens is if it happens again\nSo the sequence of returns and being able to ... not knowing what your account values are going to do that you know now and then and then in the future\nAnd then the third risk in the withdrawal rate how much percent what percent how much can you take from your investment accounts what's appropriate percentage withdrawal right to to withdraw\nIs it for ... percent yeah you go back you know there was it five percent at seven percent you know the wall Street Journal a couple of years ago had the article in the four percent rule that\nYou know talking about studies that have taken place dealing with a you know looking at it for ... percent withdrawal rate and the ability for the money to last\nYou know the Texas Tech study from the professors back in two thousand Thirteen took a million dollars to four percent out looking at various ways to invest the money all in the market all and bonds or a combination there of\nTook out at four percent wanted to go back in time when it went through a different time periods thirty five years segments\nThirty five years because eight sixty five to eight one hundred is thirty five years wanted to make sure there was money left it in the end of the day fifty three percent of the time they ran out of money\nYeah sometimes the money last ... Ninety sometimes it only lasted in age eighty two\nSo you've got to be careful here I go back and say what states that stain above which All right so that a hundred percent of the time the money would laugh at one point four percent\nOne point four ... four percent of a million dollars that's fourteen thousand dollars and that kind of cut it now maybe need to look at other ideas\nMore recent study from another investment from from an investment firm looked a a ... I Believe it's either Seventy percent stock thirty percent Bonner sixty forty split somewhere around there\nSo I'm stuck out four percent look back in history and then projecting going forward using money Carlo analysis basically trying to project going forward based on what's happened in the past\nAnd they said you have a around eighty five percent chance of making it work\nWell maybe that sounds pretty good but you know you know somebody tells you you're going to win\nI go back and say what states than about which All right so that a hundred percent of the time the money would laugh at one point four percent\nOne point four ... four percent of a million dollars that's fourteen thousand dollars of that going to cut it now maybe need to look at other ideas\nMore recent study from another investment from from an investment firm looked at a ... I Believe it's either Seventy percent stock thirty percent Bonner sixty forty split somewhere around there\nSo I'm stuck out four percent look back in history and they're projecting going forward using money Carlo analysis basically trying to project going forward based on what's happened in the past\nAnd they said you have ah around eighty five percent chance of making it work\nWell maybe that sounds pretty good but you know you know somebody tells you you're going to win the lottery you know this weekend you're probably and you have a five percent chance of winning you probably go buy a lottery ticket\nBut if you get on an airplane and the pilot says you have a Fifteen Percent chance of not plan has a Fifteen Percent chance of not making it to its destination are you going to stay on the plan\nOn the plane so you know think about that so the different risk involved that needs to be understood and least addressed in your retirement income plan longevity\nPeople living longer wanting money to last year and come to last\nSequence of returns not knowing what your accounts are going to\nDo before you retire and then after you retire when you're taking income from them and what percentage rate should you be taken out from your accounts what the appropriate or sustainable withdrawal rate for yourself\nYou know so it all comes down to that make sense to look in ideas to position accounts to been position portfolio your portfolio so maybe you can minimize the risk\nYou know they're always going to be there might be maybe you can address them and minimize them in a way that maybe you can generate more income not subject to stock market ups and downs\nAnd income that subject the interest rate movements whatever the Federal Reserve does now we're in the future\nAnd not subject to inflation big 'cause you'll be able to give yourself a raise overtime and all the while to protect and in case there was a health care issue that income will still come into the household\nSome idea maybe different thought process to look at as far as being able to generate that income and retirement understanding the difference between accumulating money for retirement and then distribute in income in retirement\nVery important to understand more and more people are starting to understand this you'll start to see more\nConversation there was a book a consortium of a investment companies\nAlliance putting together that are trying to communicate the more that more people have to focus in on a wing in it but looking at ways to generate that income in retirement I'm here to help you out\nOr do you like to talk more share some ideas where you can also have a consultation no charge no obligation give me a call or reach me through our website you can call in to my office said its toll free one eight seven seven three one seven seven six three eight zero\nOne eight seven seven three one seven seven six three zero calm and laid me a message I Would call you back a little bit after the show this afternoon you can also reach me through our website it's P.

money out of their accounts\nThen the other issue that ah it didn't seem like a big deal but more we thought about it was\nYou know maybe it was a big deal not being able to access to money if they needed to write and how does the pan or the farms but they're finding out who to track down from because the plan change providers so this person thought woods with extra investment company\nBut it ended up being over at why investment company because when they were gone after they left they change providers\nAnd some issues here hopefully it doesn't happen but something thing to be aware of and

little bit about Redskins comfort level maybe people's experience over the last several months but now maybe things have changed\nBut think about those you know what's the ideal place to invest your money which they wouldn't be the perfect investment\nWell what would be the perfect investment well maybe that I could break it down into three categories for you perhaps your perfect investment would obviously grow for you you would want it to grow right\nPerhaps you would want it to be safe\nYou know maybe not lose money and then ... you know on top of that the third page maybe would be wanting to be liquid you don't want to have to have a tied up or are not being able to access all of it so gross safety and liquidity maybe three cornerstones\nOf the perfect investment but think about this is there one investment that will have all three one that will have all three of growth safety and liquidity\nI don't think so hard pressed to find something that really does I can tell you there's probably a lot of them will have two of the three you know take it and an example of a money market account\nCan be tape it can be liquid it's not really going to grow\nA CD you said they may grow a little bit uh may be liquid after the periods over so it really doesn't have all three about a mutual fund invested in the stock market\nRight you know that's potentially going to grow right it's like what typically right and you can you change it get out of it even in a retirement account you can you make changes\nBut is it safe you know there's no really protection on the on the the downside of that a mutual fund\nYeah so is there anything that that has all three growth safety and liquidity probably none so you have to recognize that when you're planning and if you say okay one grows maybe you have to give up a little bit of liquidity\nYou know or maybe you have to give up a little bit of safety you know can you have saved in growth and maybe you give up a liquid he possibly\nYou know

training academy all over the world and it's always great to kind of once a year everybody gets together and you see a lot of old friends meet some new ones that whole thing but that is not why you

world are operations manager Mary green one that's the best operations manager in the world\nThose of you who are students I Know a will certainly respect that Mary finally got that at well ward and got her do as someone who is just done a great job with helping with students and making sure that we always have a very smoothly running operation\nBut also as a center once again we want what's called the branch camping award\nAnd does the word is only been given three times and we have one at all three times\nAnd to me it's the most important to the words that are given out because of what it's about is we're the people that do the best job of representing the ideals of the company and the ideals of the companies are all about didn't success\nAnd we really do it online trade economy Phoenix try to focus on the students' first\nAnd and the philosophy I've always tried to impart to people it's students center itself and the first thing that we have to do is focus on doing the right thing for the student then it's kind of we got to keep the lights on what do we do for the center and only at the end we really worried about kind of the individual achievements and accolades\nAnd that is served as very well actually this week will be the the eight year that I have owned the center there and uh we've come a long way and it is to do you guys to students listeners and\nJust scan and you're on the right side of the trade between the black helicopters and the NBC's there's the right side of the trade the right side of the rate is brought to buy online training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trainer education\nBut if you're just joining us today shows a little bit different it's kind of more philosophical in some ways and and actually in some ways kind of more practical I guess the normal\nWhere we just got back from our conference and we want a number of words are under the forty three online training academy campuses worldwide we in Phoenix one was called the brain\nThis is Ken and you're on the right side of the trade between the black helicopters and see NBC's there's the right side of the trade the right side of the rate is brought to buy online treaty academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trainer education\nBut if you're just joining us today shows a little bit different it's kind of more philosophical in some ways and and actually in some ways kind of more practical I guess the normal\nWhere we just got back from our conference and we want a number of words are under the forty three online training academy campuses worldwide we in Phoenix one was called the brand champion award for the third time and the words only be given three times so if you're a pretty good about that\nBut it's essentially because the people who win this or the people who do the best job of representing the values of the company and the values of the company are all about focusing on students' success\nAnd we work really really hard at it and it made me think about what is it that kind of we do I think well being supporting our students which took me to an even bigger question which was\nWhat is it really take to be successful in the market and talked about in the first segment the first thing you have to understand is what the market's really are which is totally different than what has been sold to us\nThey're not discounting mechanisms that future cash flow you cannot study a company's conference calls and know which companies are going to win and lose because first of all you're never going to know more than Goldman Sachs and city group and the people that run the companies there's always going to be able to have an informational advantage\nSo why should we try to compete where we have a weakness\nThe second part of it is is that the things that make a company successful change over time it's not just about the technology it's voted to raise money the ability to market the building itself it's about out about sourcing and logistics it's about corporate culture throughout leadership\nIt's about competitive er spawn all things that change over time now one of the difficulties is that the market's done nothing but go up potentially for nine years although maybe seen some change in that right now\nBut when the market's going up every strategy works\nYou know back in the nineties used to always talk about never confused genius with a bull market and I think there's a lot of risk and that today is well everybody that's been buying stocks and you know most people aren't doing great but they're doing kind of okay\nNow they have no real plan for what to do when the market goes down and that's like one of the really key pieces of information how do you not just survive when the market goes down but how do you thrive how do you develop a mindset where do you look forward to the opportunity of the market going down\nA conference one of the people I was talking to John O'Donnell is one of the founders of online trading academy he's our chief knowledge officer and I said so how you do and he said just waiting for the crash so I can be short [laughter] and that's how we view this and it's not that\nWe do we ... we wish harm to other people in the market to go down but we know the market's going to go down at some point and again you're starting to see some real weakness in rocky and his and\nMaybe this continues and maybe it's a reflection of interest rate and maybe as people worried about what happens after the election or any of thirty other things we've talked about on the show over the years\nBut there's a lot of things out there that one day have to come home to roost what we want to do is not to read that but just realize it's a fact of life\nAnd we want to be able to be successful when that happens we don't want to hope that we we you know we lose a bunch of money and then somehow over time we get it to come back\nThis the individual stocks almost never come back indexes come back because they're not the same stock and\nSir and I said so how do you do and he said just waiting for the crash so I can be short [laughter] and that's how we view this and it's not that we do we ... we wish harm to other people in the market to go down but we know the market's going to go down at some point and again you're starting to see some real weakness in rocky and his and\nMaybe this continues and maybe it's a reflection of interest rates and maybe as people worried about what happens after the election or any of thirty other things we've talked about on the show over the years\nBut there's a lot of things out there that one day have to come home to roost what we want to do is not dread that but just realize it's a fact of life\nAnd we want to be able to be successful when that happens we don't want to hope that we you know we lose a bunch of money and then somehow over time we get it to come back\nThis the individual stocks almost never come back indexes come back because they're not the same stock and this is something else that most people don't really understand about the market\nThey look at you know the Dow Jones industrial average and first they don't generally understand it's only thirty stocks and it's not really representative of of the market but okay fine\nBut then they think that it's kind of all it's the same stocks but it's not the stocks in the index is get changed out regularly which means that companies that go bankrupt to perform poorly\nThey go away and new stocks come in so it's a marketing tool and it gets back to the market is marketing it's people trying to convince you that this stock will get your clothes wider than white that this stock will make you more appealing to the opposite sex or whatever it may be and and I'm Serious that's what it is\nWhat happens is institutions buying stocks at low prices and this happens on an intra day basis and it happens on a very long term basis\nBut they buy the stocks when they're cheap they didn't tell you how wonderful they are they do other things as well to drive the prices of the stocks up and then they told them to you would have high price and lo and behold like any retail industry they make money because what they're doing is buying something and selling it for more\nThe retail trade or loses because they buy too late in the cycle and they don't know how to make money when it goes down and they don't how to know how to recognize the signs\nThat the market is changing direction and again we're seeing some signs right now that we may be starting that process\nIf you look at what's happening in Asia stocks were getting whack pretty hard most of the Asian indexes are down at least ten percent so far this month some of them are down to Chinatown about thirty percent this year okay and this is the other thing we got that people don't fully grasp is\nThe market moves very very quickly to the down side and I'm explain why this is in class and why it's faster the downside than the upside but when the market's moving to the downside people don't have time to react\nAs we've talked about on the show here before when the market plunged in two thousand and eight prices for the ... five hundred went back to Nineteen Ninety six levels the market literally gave back Thirteen Years of profits in a year and a half and people were totally\nBlindsided by it but that money didn't disappear someone made that money somebody's sold before it went down

R. A. D. E. R. that eight for for eight eight\nSeven twenty three thirty seven you can also get two tickets and a tablet plus we feed you guys lunch when you come out by the way but you didn't get those if you text the letters O T a\nAs an online training academy two three one nine nine six\nText the letters O.

T. A. as in online training academy two three one nine nine six\nIf you win tickets please registers who you know you're coming otherwise we may have a seat for you we may not have your tablet may have your lunch\nAnd chaos ensues and we would like to sort of a rival so coming back to this\nThe the three main pillars of understanding how to make money in this market is understand that this is a game of probability is never a game of certainty but we can get the highest possible probability if we know what to look for secondly the\nTimes that we're wrong we're going to randomly be wrong if we knew we were going to be wrong we wouldn't get into the trade so how do we minimize our losses those times were wrong\nThen how do we make our money work as hard for us as possible when you buy stock you generally have to put up at least half the money so if you buy a hundred dollar stock you have to put up you know fifty bucks in some cases you may only have to put up twenty five percent of the money but there are some rules to that\nIf you trade something my currencies you put up two percent of the money so if you want to trade a thousand dollars of a currency you literally put up twenty dollars and you can do trades where you literally put up twenty dollars\nAnd by the way when you trade something like currencies you're not dealing with things like stock through an all time highs where it's very difficult to know you wonder why where were the top in this market so so with currencies\nAre wanted these currencies are just kind of middle of the pack right now and you can make money on these very quickly in both directions as well\nSo we want to understand what the right instrument is for us to be invested in trading in\nAnd understand again this probability risk manager and meant and using the leverage to make our money worked for us again harder than we worked for it so again these are all the kinds of ideas that we teach in our classes it's what I'm going to do if you come out to the half day classes well\nNow the next set of skills that we really want to think about is\nPeople you know think about well you know this is so specialized I'm just going to let my adviser handled this with all due respect there is some people out there that are advisors that are good people trying to do the right thing\nBut the reality is the vast majority of them are simply commission sales people they are drug reps masquerading as doctors they are selling you what will make them the most money not necessarily what is best for you\nThe reason they sell you a new release is that is the highest commission product that's out there okay you're paying in many cases eight eight and a half percent up front\nYou can't get your money out for years without a penalty you're giving up a huge percentage in some cases maybe over Ninety percent of the profits that are making on your money and you're taking the risk\nHow does that make any sense okay when they're selling you stocks are selling you I mean these big banks literally have meetings on Monday Mornings or every morning\nAnd they tell their people here's what we're going to sell today and how is it that that is your best interests to have those people\nPeople they are drug reps masquerading as doctors they are selling you what will make them the most money not necessarily what is best for you\nThe reason they sell you a new release is that is the highest commission product that's out there okay you're paying in many cases eight eight and a half percent up front\nYou can't get your money out for years without a penalty you're giving up a huge percentage in some cases maybe over Ninety percent of the profits that are making on your money and you're taking the risk\nHow does that make any sense okay when they're selling you stocks are selling you I mean these big banks literally have meetings on Monday Mornings or every morning and they tell their people here's what we're going to sell today\nAnd how is it that that is your best interests to have those people making decisions with your money and and one of the things I always try to get across to people was look\nEverybody's looking out for themselves okay you and your advisors aren't bad people but they've got to feed their kids to and so when it comes down to what's best for you and what's best for them part of what's best for them as what he's the most commission part of what's best for them is what can keep their boss off their back\nYou know and by the way you know when the market's going down and one of the reasons people take these big lots of do their advisors always tell them hey you know don't sell now why did they tell you not to sell they tell you it's because the stocks always come back\nBut understand stock themselves don't generally come back we're indexes comeback it can take Fifteen or Twenty years why would you give up half of your investing life potential because most people thirty five or forty years give up half of it hoping to break even how is that is your best interest\nThe reason they tell you that you that as long as you own stocks you won't take your money out of the account and they can keep generating fees the minute you go to cash you might take your money out that's why they really tell you to do that\nBut the unfortunate reality is there's nothing in that decision process that comes down to hey well what's best for for Joe bag a donut you are my client it's what's my boss smart way to sell or need me to sell what's paying the best bonus this month how do I get the highest commission\nAnd again it gets back to me to this to rational approaches to the market\nEither learn how to do this yourself and do it right or stay out there is no law that says you have to put your hard earned money at risk and the market but if you're going to do it do it as an informed investor or a traitor and again one of the things that a lot of people would become students are at online training academy\nIt's just to even know the questions to ask so they don't feel so intimidated by the advisor so again if you want to understand how this stuff works and just to understand questions to ask her advisor\nBe one of the next dozen colors you can get to free tickets and a free tablet\nWould you get to free tickets to half the class plus we will feed you launch call aid for for eight eight seven twenty three thirty seven\nThat eighty four forty eight trader or you can check the letters O T a as an online training academy two three one nine nine six\nText O T a two three one nine nine six [noise] if you win and please registers we know you're coming or having your seat or lunch new tablet and we'll see you there [noise]\nFrom our perspective we even have the same structures that everybody else uses so many ways of mentoring the same one of the things that we do is\nWe we give people levels of on thirty five different markets every day of where we see institutional buying and selling we do live trading every two hours a day over a hundred times a month\nUsing real money so our students can see other people trading how they're making their decisions being able to ask questions and trade alongside we we give educational picks the students that really helped him understand why we've chosen certain trades in certain levels\nThere's a tremendous amount of resources that way but again that's available in every online training academy campus around the world\nBut what we're we're focused on its students' students' support peace\nThe ability for you to come in literally seven days a week to come in at night and sit down with someone who's a student who's been through this process who's been successful who can talk to you about putting together a trade plant and review your trade plant and reviewing your trades against your trade plant\nWho could help motivate you who can keep you on the right track who can keep moving forward we have a tremendous amount of resources available for that because it's the key to the whole thing you can't learn how to do this out of a book you can't learn this from CD\nCould you learn magical indicators sure but then I'm going to ask you how do you know which is a hundred and fifty indicators to use on any given trade how do you know which of the infinite available parameters you should use and this given trade and the short answer is you don't\nThe indicators work until they don't and the reality is that these things generally are have about fifty percent or less probability rating so how is that going to be the foundation of the successful set of strategies especially when most of them have terrible if any risk management which again from a knowledge perspective is key\nWe can help motivate you we can keep you on the right path", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cave Creek", "day": "25"}
