to be really cool\nReally do you think so I\nHave five five hundred Savage you get you on board the program a five five four hundred Savage and you're on board\nAnd have you been paying attention to the stuff that the hurricanes okay I live in Florida so when I hear this stuff about the hurricanes and I'm being told that they are getting bigger more intense and there's more of them because of global warming I said what and when I saw President Trump on the Leslie stall on Sunday\nI said well I Wish somebody brief President Trump because the truth is there is no trend of more hurricanes on the planet there is no trend of more intense hurricanes on the planet I don't care what the so called experts are telling you and when Lesley Stahl said what scientists are saying that's not true he should have said\nRoy Spencer PHD\nBecause Roy Spencers been studying this stuff for a long time he's a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama Huntsville he's written in visible inevitable disaster why hurricanes cannot be blamed on global warming and global warming skepticism for busy people\nAnd he does it with facts from our own government and he's ... he's got this out inconvenient data no trend in Florida hurricane strikes\nAnd he's just updated a plot of Florida major hurricane strikes that he's been doing it and it follows hurricane strikes since Nineteen hundred and it includes hurricane Michael\nAnd here's what he found no trend in either intensity or frequency of hurricane strikes over the last one hundred and Eighteen years and he uses National Hurricane center data to do it he's not making up the data like so many in the global warming movement does do excuse me\nSays the trend line for intensity is flat the trend line in number of storms is downward but it's in significant\nBut it is downward not offered so there is no data that shows there are more hurricanes and there is no data that the hurricanes are intensifying if you look at real data and you look at it over a real period of time and not just the window you want to cherry pick\nBoy the Gulf of Mexico is unusually warm so expensive\nThose hurricane strikes since Nineteen hundred and it includes hurricane Michael and here's what he found no trend in either intensity or frequency of\nHurricane strikes over the last one hundred and Eighteen years and he uses National Hurricane center data to do it he's not making up the data like so many in the global warming movement does do excuse me\nSays the trend line for intensity is flat the trend line in number of storms is downward but it's in significant\nBut it is downward not up word so there is no data that shows there are more hurricanes and there is no data that the hurricanes are intensifying if you look at real data and you look at it over a real period of time and not just the window you want to cherry pick\nBoyd the Gulf of Mexico is unusually warm so Spencer point that well yeah but if you look at the history of July August September average the temperature\nYou'll see that since Eighteen sixty this summer\nIs only the ninth warmest in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and other top ten warmest Gulf here since Eighteen sixty seven occurred both for Nineteen Seventy which is both for we experienced any significant warming\nWell but we're going to get more of these really\nMajor hurricanes are part of nature Spencer points out and he looked at lake bottom sediment in western like in the Florida Panhandle very close to where Michael Bay landfall and he said over the last one thousand years it's been relatively quiet for cat four and five hurricanes but\nFrom one thousand two thousand years ago there was a hyperactive period of intense land falls in the Florida Panhandle in other words there's been time in this plant history where there have\nBeen more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes in Florida than there are today or long before so called global warming\n\nBy the way the latest hurricane experts who claim that there are more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes\n\nThat is going on in this country we all did not see what happened in Portland, Oregon because it was blacked out by the wonderful people in the media will give you fake news on a daily basis\nThey did that show you the communist flags the Palestinian flags did that show you who's underneath those maps were twenty foot

with the last caravan\nPresident Trump last time when a couple of thousand of them came up he threatened to withdraw aid from Honduras or that never happened and the uh the migrants the illegals reached our southern border\nWe can't let that happen again\nAnd if Mexico is not going to cooperate and then they will probably make it to our border\nBut that doesn't mean we have to let him in\nAnd let's hope this time or the Trump Administration sticks to that let me go to Greg Greg\nHey Joe I was just going to say a couple of things first of all if someone thinking asylum right\nYeah the idea is they're fleeing from something like violent yes if the violence on jurors when they reach Guatemala they've already found is Iowa thank you right\nThat's really what they're looking for is not asylum they're looking for a to come to a place where there's more of fluid nothing wrong with that I don't blame them but that's what they're looking to do\nAnd don't buy the only Greg Greg I'll give you can point but just to back up your first point Guatemala again has said they will not provide asylum to these people\nRight out of the matter is you know if\nIt if there were another\nWealthy country between us and you cannot mandate what you ought there exactly right yeah they're just coming here because we're in a wealthy country it's not because they they've they've already escaped the violence when they get to whatever the next country is that they're not quite right yeah\nBut look I don't blame if people I mean our life is not good they want to get to a better place at the same point a Trump can threaten the same thing again Guatemala and Mexico but he did get found it they let the caravan continue toward our border he can pull funding from Guatemala and Mexico but\nHe's got to do something you're right because we\nThey will not provide asylum to these people\nRight exactly how does it matter you know if it if there were another wealthy country between us and you have this caravan they went\nOut there exactly right\nYeah they're just coming here because we're in a wealthy country it's not because they they've ... they've already escape the violence when they get to whatever the next country is that they're not quite right yeah\nBut look I don't blame me for people I mean our life is not good they want to get to a better place at the same point a Trump can threaten the same thing again Guatemala and Mexico but he did get founder and they let the caravan continue toward our border he can pull funding from Guatemala and Mexico but\nHe's got to do something you're right because we can't just let everyone in the world who wants to come to the U.S in the U.S it just it won't work\nThank you Greg it just it well it won't work and it's not right there are\nWays to seek asylum and it's not proper to just you win a thousand to your best friends just come walking across or crawling across our border\n\nNow everybody got upset about this when this happened at the end of April in early may this past year and the Trump Administration talked tough man but most of them mentally came in we cannot let that happen again let me go to Steve

help the elderly the infirm and the unborn and following the theme we picked up last week of course we went over the central ten errors of the decision of roe v Wade and Dolby Bolton and voices and all kinds of fancy things that were educated when I was just a young lad\nIn San Francisco this week we're going to concentrate our efforts on disgusting\nWe have an in Studio guest I Know we've had in a studio guest before and we've had phone gifts\nAnd in our third program and the season of the Bruce Dixon show we want to dive right and one of our aims here a Bruce Lee white charities was founded to not only support the charities of like the coffee but to highlight the great things that are going on in the valley the sun\nTo help the elderly the infirm and the unborn and following the theme we picked up last week of course we went over the central ten errors of the decision of roe v Wade and Dolby Bolton and voices and all kinds of fancy things that were adjudicated when I was just a young lad\nIn San Francisco this week we're going to concentrate our efforts on discussing one of the greatest assets we have our neighbor to the north here on seventh street where seventh street done lap I think they're just north of seventh street and hatch or\nHow did America come to be in love with death\nThoughts on that [noise] um [noise]\nYou know I think once again I go back to their political and financial motivation for people to support that\nAnd it's it's big money involved in selling death selling ...\nWhere were you saying that all of the business and research\nAnd I'm In that political affiliations with that are very financially benefitted by the abortion industry so um\nYou know I just think that I'm\nSaving a baby's life doesn't carry that same late in the media is so biased against the ... so we see that and the Kevin ... and other places\n[noise] yeah and a lot of times I think we get into conversations they can get up to this upper echelon and we go into some reasons why and and that's great because it's important to get behind the scenes but it's important to remember also that\nWomen every single day\nThat experience crisis one way or another is there um you have almost like an NFL coach you ever play sheet of encouragement that you guys I mean go through every day is it prayer or is it I mean is it scripted in that sense or is it just every encounters different\nWell a little bit of both um certainly I think starting today with Paris key um there's um manuals and approaches\nRight and the media is so biased against ... so we we see that and you Kevin ... and other places\n[noise] yeah and a lot of times I think we get into conversations that can get up to this upper echelon and we go into some reasons why and and that's great because it's important to get behind the scenes but it's important to remember also that\nWomen every single day\nThat experience crisis one way or another is there um you have almost like an NFL coach you ever play sheet of encouragement that you guys I mean go through every day is it prayer or is it I mean is it scripted in that sense or is it just every encounters different\nWell a little bit of both um certainly I think starting today with Paris key um there's um manuals and approaches we call it the love approach um\nYou know being being listened to the to the woman to hear her problems so there is a played like as far as that goes right to every woman's second stance on second to be unique\nRight so how many people\nAre on the ground with to any given day I'm about Fifteen in both locations yeah then and then how about the the mobile clinic which goes many places will get some more about that after the break but\nHow many people are on the mobile clinic typically to OK clay and ... sometimes\nAnd how far east and west use that mobile claiming Trump\nOver the years it's a traveled quite a bit right now we're going out to about fifty ninth avenue in\nEugene oh obviously\nBut I mean you probably log what a hundred thousand miles on it or something intrepid like that oh I don't have the mileage sorry you should have like a little blog like [laughter] a long ride live from every location\nBut it is I mean is it just ... yourself and some specially trained counselors that encounter women on these daily basis what is the first thing like I mean is it Hi how you doing let's have a cup of coffee or ... what's that first moment like\nWell it tends to be um a phone call or ... okay or an email so that's the very first thing yeah I don't think it's reaching out and saying hey you know I I Need some help on how what do you do\nAnd um I got ya and what's that called volume like everyday hundred calls a day fifty thirty depends on the day\nIt depends mundane side of the day the day so we had something to just rain nonstop all day three people and turn them wow and then a ... house job\nWell if you're just tuned in its the Bruce Dixie show live from the likes of coffee studios right here at seventh street and done lap\nWe're very privileged to have in Studio ... Riley the director of life choices women clinics women's clinics to locations seventh street just north of life of coffee at ... and thirty Fifth Avenue and ... which kind of talking about this encounter of\nHere in the valley and particularly the needed so great and\nJust the numbers that we talked about in this first little bit here\nSeven thousand a year so\nI mean that's that's huge and how many other what will say quote unquote pro life groups are you aware of in the valley doing similar things there about fifty in the state of Arizona okay so we can do some multiplication here yeah\nMore than a million people probably year reaching out to these locations collectively then that's not to mention things that we don't even know about because our our\nAt play appear to say they discuss all the options to\nThese women clinics women's clinics to locations seventh street just north of life of coffee at ... and thirty Fifth Avenue and ... which kind of talking about this encounter of\nWhere here in the valley and particularly the needed so great and just the numbers that we talked about in this first little bit here\nSeven thousand a year so yes I mean that's that's huge and how many other what will say quote unquote pro life groups are you aware of in the valley doing similar things there about fifty in the state of Arizona okay so we can do the multiplication here yeah\nMore than a million people probably year reaching out to these locations collectively and that's not to mention things that we don't even know about because our our\nAt play appear to say they discuss all the options to ride I mean there may be people who actually looking for\nThings that don't get answered there I mean it would be\nAt least best anecdotally to say that\nPlanned Parenthood not pushing adoption or\nStaying at home with your mom and having the baby you know they're probably not pushing those options right\nYeah I remember a story woman came in to me and um she said she was considering abortion and ... we did the pregnancy tests and sat down and said ... kind of going over abortion with her and she looked at me and said well I don't really want an abortion I thought if I said that\nYou wouldn't be trying to talk me into it so she [laughter] said had that experience and I abortion clinic where she said she was going to have the baby and they tried to pressure hurts have an abortion so she's like oh I just I just wanted to avoid that conversations I just put down an abortion\n[laughter] well that's an interesting dynamic right so\nI Know we've heard over the years you know I've been involved in this my whole adult life\nSo I don't know thirty\nActively involve myself\nYou here in numbers like or or things like the numbers of surgical abortions are going down across the country\nI don't know what the facts are but it seems to me I could hypothesize that the numbers of chemical abortions\nAre rapidly increasing in sort of an inverted curve against that decline and surgical abortions would you agree with that\nLet's say ... ... the Bush and held more common in probably increasing um yeah but most states count both kinds of abortions and those have dropped a little bit in uptown and then they searched\nAnd a little bit um we think they're reporting it Stan skewed skewed a little bit ... inaccurate\nWell when I was going to drive out here before we are going to go to the break is about and they are just in the next few minutes\nThere's been a lot of great progress in\nUh the reverse of the argue forty six\nIn particular you know and I don't know if there's any women listening tonight or family members you know women that\nAre considering already forty six or have recently very recently taken already forty six but there's a way to reverse that now\nThat is correct and we did that at our clinics\nRight and I wanted to bring that up because\nEverybody's human being you know everybody falls and makes mistakes or even have lapses in judgment I myself with the greatest among them but\nThere is hope even in these instances right and I think that's the great message of having the whole mobile clinic ride how does that work I and I I Want to get to the clinic's ... after the break too but very briefly two minutes or less how does that pill reversal work and how\nWell the sooner the better um\nThe reverse of the argue forty six\nIn particular you know and I don't know if there's any women listening tonight or family members you know women that are considering already forty six or have recently very recently taken already forty six but there's a way to reverse that now\nThat's correct and we did that at our clinics\nRight and I wanted to bring that up because\nEverybody's human being you know everybody falls and makes mistakes or even have lapses in judgment I myself with the greatest among them but\nThere is hope even in these instances right and I think that's the great advantage of having the whole mobile clinic right how does that work I and I I Want to get to the clinic's ... after the break too but very briefly two minutes or less how does that pill reversal work and how\nHow soon as they have to be done well the sooner the better um the sweet spot is within twelve hours in what women will say often is as soon as they saw that abortion pill they had regrets and of course if they can throw it out that's great\nBut I'm the fortune ... cutoff nutrients to the pregnancy okay that will kill the pregnancy someone when we come in and they're trying to do the reverse of what we did the sound\nAnd sometimes we see that heartbeat very very rapid and that's the baby fighting for flights while and then we sent slowing down and it gets soaring summer until it stops\n... said the gesture and can feed the pregnancy projection is a medication\nThat she is for women who've had multiple miscarriages sometimes to help\nYou get more nutrients that pregnancy and so when a woman send the abortion pill reversal will give her\n... that she will take 'em for the first twelve weeks of pregnancy to make sure that pregnancy gets proper nutrition\nSo that's pretty amazing it's amazing that fifty percent of women who do the abortion poll reversal babies survive\nWow that's an amazing statistic is well you guys see a lot of those cases\nWe don't see a huge number but um yeah we do see a few and it's amazing and we've got to\nBabies are alive who were born in\n... that mind boggling yeah do you guys have a I have no shame fully I've been to the mobile clinic but I haven't been in in to the physical plant\nOr do you guys have all the pictures on the wall babies or anything like that now know we take privacy of our patients very seriously I mean just the babies will be super fuel or just like little representations and they\nCome visit her off [laughter] no I mean obviously there\nWere a nice calendar [laughter] wouldn't that be nice to have like some kind of like a pin and every location I don't know something to say look at all these people it was the goal is encouragement\nYeah well you know we had some women tell their stories and we do get written permission to tell some stories but um for the most part um you know women in these situations really want their privacy\nI understand that makes total sense it's the Bruce diction show live at the life of coffee studios in about a thirty seconds we're going to go to a break and get some news is probably our on our host am eleven hundred K. if an ex the valleys independent talk radio and uh I hear the music but most me and I need to go pretty soon\nUm but then we'll have services for after the babies born two\nSets of follow up support so she's\nThe dry and less formula close\nHousing stuff all that so yeah all that and so she might end up back with us at that point\nAnd what the timeline like let's say\nA girl text you tomorrow morning not am\nWhat's the timeline is fear and then how long do you typically stay with a client well\nWe can try to get women in the same day if it's a crisis pregnancy that's certainly our goal um and then for ... about a week out\nAnd not bad no not at all and um [noise] so and how long should stay with us that it is very firm woman to a woman because what happens is she's very concerned about telling family what well her parents say but after that\nShe gets passed that parents tend to rally they they they they she doesn't need our services as much anymore and she'll drift away but others stay in touch over the years and\nUh I've got to be very rewarding and some of my babies have babies wow yeah\nWell you've been out of the while the violent [laughter] [noise]\nYeah it's always astounded be where you hear the story the news at least once a month you know that some young woman\nComes home says mom dad I'm pregnant and she gets kicked out of house\nI've never understood that but it happens right\nIt's very infrequent because um you know parents love their kids they they they're not as fragile as the kids think they are parents have dealt with crisis in the past and you know they are going to deal with this crisis since well\nWhat about boyfriends and husbands badgering women into abortion you encounter that all\nWe do sometimes and um we you know we wanted them to come into the office with the patient so that we can talk to them together or separately and um you know it's amazing that\nMen often really don't understand the issues as well and so once they really understand what a portion is they're offended they\nThey say oh you know they would really do that I don't know if you had a chance to the ... movie\nI can talk about that in the in the kicker so yeah\nNot a fragile as the kids think they are parents have dealt with crisis in the past and you know they are going to deal with this crisis is well\nWhat about boyfriends and husbands badgering women into abortion you encounter that all we\nDo sometimes and um we you know we wanted them to come into the office which the patients so that we can talk to them together or separately and um yeah it's amazing that\nMen often really don't understand the issues as well and so once they really understand what a portion is they're offended they\nThey say oh you know they would really do that I don't know if you've had a chance to the ... movie\nI can talk about that in the in the kicker so yeah and uh but that\nThing is really eye opening\nPeople need to yeah they just don't understand but once they kind of start looking at it and then you know of course they want to think to themselves and they'll say laugh\nYeah so I mean you but you hear every day of the things going on and you wonder in your mind's eye you know is it\nIt seems unbelievable in every respect to the word that\nAnybody would want to do that but then at the same time we hear numbers of like\nYou know two thousand and three thousand times a day anywhere in the country babies are dying yeah\nSo what I'm hearing you say and what I read and what the CDC reports with the Guggenheim or Institute seemed to be\nLike we're not hearing to say we don't have our finger on the same outer post because well here's what I'm saying you guys are doing such great work you're not in countering that same\nDarkness since it's early\nBut there are losses rice I mean you\nAnd that's now but it seems by our conversation at least that victories far outweigh\nThe losses yeah especially with the ultrasound machine when a woman sees her baby she's here's the heartbeat you know it it it changes the issue the problems from let me get rid of it to how can I deal with it\nOkay and that makes sense and because\nObviously you guys have been out since a while and there's\nTo at least hope there's an alliance here in the valley of people that work together right\nYeah we have meeting some of every few months of the pregnancy centers\nThat's great writer because that's how it should work right 'cause not everybody can do everything\nYes yeah and ... different pregnancy centers can take on different um can change\nTheir services they offer like H women in Tempe that's over ... down there to them for that are very conveniently located the ASU campus that's true yeah and where they are on the GYN care\n[noise] All right well it's a forty three minutes after the hour if you'd just tuned in its Bruce Nixon show live the life of coffee studios here in the street and done that\nI'm Bruce addict and we're in Studio ... Riley the director of life choices women's clinics\nThere are two brick and mortar locations if you or anyone you love or no needs or to speak to them it's easy to get a hold and we'll get to the information here in a minute a but it's crisis pregnancy\nOr STD screening\nOBGYNs services if they're needed counseling talked about counseling\nWe yes that is a part of everything we offer you know Catholic healthcare used to I just read an article um subtitled 'em wet from nuns and habits to men in suits [laughter] and I'm so they've gotten from offering holistic care that cared about the person's body\n[noise] All right well it's a forty three minutes after the hour if you just tuned in its Bruce Nixon show live the life of coffee studios here in the street and done that\nI'm Bruce ... and we're in the studio with Sheila Riley the director of life choices women's clinics\nThere are two brick and mortar location if you or anyone you love or no needs a to speak to them it's easy to get a hold and we'll get to the information here in a minute a but it's crisis pregnancy\nOr STD screening\nOBGYNs services if they're needed counseling\nTalked about counseling we yes that is a part of everything we offer you know Catholic healthcare is to just read an article um subtitled um went from nuns and habits to men in suits [laughter] and I'm so they've gotten from offering holistic care that cared about the person's\nBody that also their emotions and their spirit right and now it's more about the money in the bottom line so we're really stepping packing offering a more holistic health care where we are dealing with both the body the emotions and the spirit so we'll talk to them about\nUm you know their face and we'll talk to them about\nThen coming ocean carry water is these days right talking about their faith not here this is right they friendly [laughter] right I mean you could argue that all the time people\nSee the crucifix on the wall here in the in the coffee shop and\nOther symbols around the shop and I've gotten some glances people walked out but the people I've you know\nIt used to be very common for people say God Bless you or something another environment but it seems somewhat hospital in the culture at large but you guys tread into the water oh of\nCourse you have because they're making the decision to their lives and certainly their faith is going to guide them in these big decisions of life\nAnd I I this is just a question that it's the proper due I had I mean do you find that most\nPeople you encountered have some faith that waste absolutely and that's a positive sign mhm that's a that's a hope in its own regard right that you're encountering young people or whatever age they might be and there's still a face out there because if you listen to the news it seems like this is no longer a Christian nation right\nThat you can get that impression is my point you\nCan get that impression I think what's happening for many of my clients that I not certainly not all that for many the safe is um\nBut you know what I mean it's a interwoven into that\nPerfect little vocabulary words All right we have ah about ten minutes and I want to get back to the mobile clinic\nAnd we haven't talked about this just yet but one of the things that I Know you\nDo I've seen you there many times not as many times as you've seen me not there if that makes sense\nYou guys are there almost every Sunday at the Planned Parenthood around fifty ninth avenue in New Jersey right\nUm yeah we have a revolving schedule okay so it's not every Sunday um than we've had some some ... a mechanical issues of recent ah keeping that grounded but um we did go to that abortion clinic it is one of the places where\nUm women going in can see that bus and they can you hear the federal counselor just offering them alternative um free pregnancy tests the Alps town now wait and um it's beautiful but we've seen many baby saves\nYou a big flower on the side and pretty colors them is very inviting it was my point yes I I think so a stark alternative to what\nNot as many times have you seen me not there if that makes sense you guys are there almost every Sunday at the Planned Parenthood around fifty ninth avenue and Eugene right\nUm yeah we have a revolving scheduled okay so it's not every Sunday um than we've had some some a mechanical issues of recent uh keeping at grounded but um we do go to that abortion clinic and it's one of the places where\nUm women going in can see that bus and they can you hear the federal counselor just offering them alternative um free pregnancy tests the Alps town now wait and um it's beautiful but the the mini baby saved\nSkeptics that our on the side and pretty colors them is very inviting it was my point yes I I think so a stark alternative to what's awaiting them and that cold stucco building yeah\nWe had a client who um said that yes you heard the word help and she said I was I didn't have any of that and I wanted that and that's why she came to our clinic\nYeah it's like you guys provide hoping hopeless world and love and such hateful times it's kind of like the little thing you know it's important because I I Am guessing here but are over my experience in the last Thirty years\nTalking to hundreds maybe a thousand different women who've been through similar experiences\nThey've all said essentially what you've just said that there's\nThat seems to be compounded\nAnd the enemy the great enemy old horn had really does a great job of\nTrying to convict people and make them feel guilty and maybe a sense of shame and wrongdoing or you know or even\nA sense of average in greed when it comes to having multiple children that can't possibly be done there's never enough resource as right and that's the sense of hopelessness that only\nFaith and the people are willing to do the work on the ground like yourself and others can overcome because there's not going to magically appear\nWhich is why you're doing the work right why we do the work [laughter]\nAll right so the mobile clinics out there\nAnd I hope you guys will tune in next Tuesday nine o'clock to the Bruce Nixon show and I think I'm about out of time but in the meantime I Want to say goodnight and God Bless and pray for America boy did we needed at all for now\n\nNine o'clock to the Bruce Nixon show and I

Frank at all\nI did not was on loan them a bit but a lot but personally acquainted with them now\nWhat do you think we're being told that he was in that embassy in Turkey for uh some interrogation ie apparently walked in to try to get a birth certificate of some kind that was going to allow him are no divorce or typical that would allow him to get married to his fiance and he\nGoes in his fiance standing outside he simply does not come back out at the time the embassy a a closed up and he was apparently a interrogated and they say an interrogation gone wrong what little we been able to find out about what happened is it pretty clear here that the Saudi Government or people who acted\nOn behalf of the Saudi Government murdered this man\n[noise] it seems as though that's the case of course and the and the consulate that would've been people who were supposed to be there um presumably\nRepresentatives of the Saudi Government there were some Fifteen men but even with special forces background to ... or flown in I think earlier that day or the day before and\nLeft immediately after this incident so there's there's a lot of circumstantial evidence that suggests that the government of Saudi Arabia was involved I I kinda think of is from what we know so far Lars this kind of a [noise] a mafia war\nBecause no one had you had the\nSaudi Government a predominantly now guided by the crown prince Mohammed bin saw law and order and the U.S a man who is\nClearly a consolidating power and trying to take his country and about different ways uh uh in a new direction yeah on the other hand you had a guy who was very\nClosely associated with and seems to have worked for the former head of Saudi intelligence turkey I'll flies all of a man with the Muslim Brotherhood background or who had worked in the media\nSo there there's a lot of circumstantial evidence that suggests that the government of Saudi Arabia was involved I I kind of think of is from what we know so far Lars this kind of a a mafia war\nBecause on the one hand you had the\nSaudi Government a predominantly now guided by the crown prince Mohammed bin ... and the U.S a man who is\nClearly a consolidating power and trying to take his country and about different ways or a in a new direction yeah and on the other hand you had a guy who was very\nClosely associated with and seems to have worked for the former head of Saudi intelligence turkey all ... all\nOf a man with the Muslim Brotherhood background or who had worked in the media relations a space for a turkey ... and the intelligence services of a Saudi Arabia under the previous government\nOr the one that uh that is how modern that his father of essentially replaced and what we know about that\nLars as having a densely uh this Muslim brother or to mark ... was a working it\nAppears with ... all against\nHis own government and so it wasn't just that he was saying nasty things about it and that can\nBe a capital offense by the way out there is law and here's insulting the keepers of the holy places uh the the family of Saudi Arabia royal family but he was also threatening it seems uh the the uh the government of a now predominantly\nMB ass as they call it so it it was a it was a\nParent Lee whether it was designed to such or whether it just went bad wait until now at the moment but I think it was kind of like a you know one ... or ... took out the other hand I've ended up in a ruthless Sasha\nMy because Frank I think the American people and I I think you know there's been a night or being sold a bill of goods are being told while this innocent journalist who's just writing things that are critical of the government which journalist in this country do all the time whether it's\nObama or Trump they they write critical things about the government I said critical things about the government but this guy was a player in the Muslim Brotherhood he was a friend\nOf Osama bin Laden and you said that he shared that organizations goal of trying to supplant the current government which is you say the current government of Saudi Arabia is trying to take that country in a western direction and uh and and this guy was trying to stop that so\nYou know wild that while that may not justify his murder um I I could certainly see that the American public's being told was just a journalist who was murdered and that's wrong they're not being told he was a political player who may have been trying to\nIs it fair to say overthrow the current Saudi Government and take it back and Islam is direction\n[noise] well it certainly reason to believe that that's the aspirations of the Muslim Brotherhood you know they they didn't to\nOverthrow the government of a President Mubarak in Egypt Today they were able to achieve that through a democratic process but they certainly were I'm taking Egypt in ... premises direction now the government of Saudi Arabia Sharif premises too but it's\nIt's a it's a\nGroup under the Brotherhood that would be very hostile\nTo us as was the Morsi regime\nIn a post Mubarak Egypt and I think\nWhat the president the government is is trying to wrestle with his first of all we don't know as much as we'd like then second of all we don't want to bring\nAs long as direction [noise] well it certainly reason to believe that that's the aspirations of the Muslim Brotherhood you know they they didn't to\nOverthrow the government of a President Mubarak in Egypt they they were able to achieve that through a democratic process but they certainly were I'm taking Egypt in ... premises direction now the government of Saudi Arabia ... premises too but it's\nIt's a it's a\nGroup under the Brotherhood that would be very hostile\nTo us as was the Morsi regime in a post Mubarak Egypt and I think what the president the government is is trying to wrestle with is first of all we don't know as much as we'd like then second of all we don't want to\nBring or otherwise contribute to the removal of the relatively friendly not altogether but relatively French government to undermine that solve odd was one that would be dead set\nAgainst us and our vital interests in a strategic place like Saudi Arabia the Iranians would like that other enemies of this country would applaud but I think that's not in our interest in the president's walking a fine line I think\nYeah and it's a tough one let's talk about something else the statutory commission to assess the threat\nTo the United states from electromagnetic pulse big name we've talked about EMP before on this program\nIt could come from an an attack from any number of sources that could come from a natural solar flare but it would literally knock out some or all of every single computer chip in America which runs everything refrigeration water power sewer\nYou know the the whole thing and in many many people would die if that happened in even a an area of this country the Congress has finally hearing some specific things that can be done to safeguard against this threat\nWell they've been hearing it for years a large the first of these commissions are reported in two thousand four and a has done so several times since I'm a whole bunch of reports were finished about a year ago or they haven't seen\nThe public light some of them are classified but some of them were supposed to be unclassified and the government is sort of been sitting on them meanwhile the commission that was extraordinarily informed knowledgeable talented and uh I think authoritative\nOn these matters has been replaced\nBy a politically appointed one that I fear is going to be none of those things and so we may not actually get the kind of\nA clarity about the danger that we're facing a let alone the tide of corrective action that's needed um\nAt least in this uh this new commission that's coming on stream a presumably shortly is a is involved and and this is heartbreaking because I think the president wants to do something about this I Believe John Bolton has bass or a national security advisor is very ... committed to trying to\nFix this there's an executive order that sort of a kicking around inside the the executive branch at the moment to protect our grid it's absolutely vital when you say a lot of\nThe cars might die by some estimates according to the previous commission it might be Ninety percent of us yeah\nEven hit the ... yeah I mean if we had kind of attacks and you know North Korea that maybe a smaller a threat at this point but if anybody a terrorist group in the west coast with an MP and knocked out all water all power all sewer all all all supply all ability to move goods around or\nAnything like that we could we could end up with a lot of communication that all of that even if the rest of the country we're capable of throwing in to help we see how even small disasters or will will test\nA national security adviser is very committed to trying to shake sisters and executive order that sort of a kicking around and so the the executive branch at the moment to protect our grid it's absolutely vital when you say a lot of\n'cause like die by some estimates according to the previous commission it might be Ninety percent of us yeah\nEven if he had all kinds of stuff yeah I mean if we had a kind of attacks and you know North Korea that maybe a smaller a threat at this point but if anybody a terrorist group in the west coast within the MPs knocked out all water all power all sewer all all all supply all ability to move goods around or\nAnything like that we could we could end up with a lot of communication that all of that even if the rest of the country we're capable of throwing in to help we see how even small disasters\nOr will will tax the ability of the country to to deal with it you know a hurricane that he gets a relatively small area and it still takes a tremendous amount of resources to make that happen so\nBy the way your data is everywhere data breaches

police the terrorist rod do on like deem a twenty five year old terrorists stabbed and murdered the police officer or no bell trend\nThat we're being told that you can't honor him you can't name a street after him because that will upset the Muslims\nIf you were a follower of Islam I have no problem with you practicing your religion if you're a follower a follower of Islam who it'd be troubled by honoring a police officer who sacrificed his own life to save that of a hostage\nThen you're not my kind of Muslim that'll let's go to Jonathan and Kentucky hey Jonathan welcome to the Lars Larson

is doom and gloom but one source goes against that notion and it uses good solid evidence to back it up\nOne of the editors of human progress joins me now Mario ... Mario on to be a Mariano welcome to the program\nThe good evening it's a difficult name to pronounce but I Know that goes to a slasher yeah I\nI I can tell that just by talking to you and I have to tell you of all the Web sites that I see\nAnd I do a lot of research and I I Try not to confine myself to just a narrow range yours is perhaps the most optimistic but not optimistic you know based on just who Pollyanna look at the world but optimism based on real numbers\nAnd I'm I I follow your Twitter feed and I think it's absolutely amazing what you've been able to do so\nGive my audience a taste of what happens when you actually look at the real numbers not just about the United states but about the rest of the world and how things are are getting and had been getting a lot better for a long time and they're on an upward trend\nOh thanks for the opportunity to do to your uh took to audience ah basically\nUm it's much easier to put together a list of things with the world is getting was that in a list of things where the world is getting better because the world is improving along many disarm die mentions a most importantly obviously people live much longer than they used to\nUm get a life expectancy for hundreds of thousands of years really was about twenty five to seven years uh now it's ah\nI'm Seventy nine years in a in a rich countries\nGive my audience a taste of what

they're on an upward trend\nWell thanks for the opportunity to do to your uh took to an audience ah basically\nUm ... it's much easier to put together a list of things where the world is getting was that an a list of things where the world is getting better because the world is improving along many different die mentions a most importantly obviously people live much longer than they used to\nUm get a life expectancy for hundreds of thousands of years really was about twenty five to seven years are now it's ah\nI'm Seventy nine years in a in rich countries it's Seventy two years in developing world um we have more food than ever before ah for most of human history people worried about getting enough calories to see\nThe next day [noise] um today even worry about obesity\nUm illiteracy ah it it's almost a universal um\nGirls go to school was previously a they learned allows to 'em there's even more peace around the world very few people appreciate that are really for the first time in recorded history there are no international conflict by which I mean conflict between two southern nations so\nThat there are a lot of ways in which I'm In which the world is getting better unfortunately\nOr the media but also the human brain and we can talk about the structure of the human brain late to\nA focus is on the negative rather than the positive and so he set of long term trends people are looking at um you know individual instances of where a something bad happens and they assume that that somehow the representatives of the trends ...\nMurray on I I have to plead guilty that I've worked in the news business for a long time and I I hated it but people would say why is that you always tell bad news and I said well\nUh we have I happen to live in a city with a few hundred thousand homes and I said we always do the story about the one home that caught fire last night instead of the two hundred and Ninety nine thousand homes\nThat didn't catch fire and that can lead you to a little bit of a pessimistic attitude but I'll tell you the number that impressed me the most because we realize that well money isn't everything the ability to be out of the extreme poverty which has been you know it's been the norm as you say for an awful lot of the world for a long time\nBut you took numbers in the world bank and pointed out the people who live in extreme poverty in Nineteen Ninety that was thirty six percent of the world more than a third of the world\nLived in extreme poverty and lived on less than two dollars US dollars per day and that's adjusted for local prices that number between Nineteen Ninety and today twenty five years dropped from a third of the world\nTo about one tenth of the world now we'd like to get it to zero zero but you said even though world population increase by two billion people the number of those who were extremely\nPoor you know this is just scratching the living out of the dirt was was reduced by one point two billion and I just wish more of those numbers were put in income to put it in context the other developments where we do have to say there's a famine here or a drought there\n[noise] yeah I'm as max Rosa from ... pointed out um we could have a ... or the number are we in the newspapers could run the following headline every day one hundred and Seventy seven thousand people have escaped from a salute to ...\nFor mobile prices that number between Nineteen Ninety and today twenty five years dropped from a third of the world\nTo about one tenth of the world now we'd like to get it to zero zero but you said\nEven though world population increase by two billion people the number of those who were extremely\nPoor you know this is just scratching a living out of the dirt was was reduced by one point two billion and I just wish more of those numbers were put in income to put it in context the other developments where we do have to say there's a famine here or a drought there\n[noise] yeah I'm as max Rosa from ... pointed out um we could have a ... or the number\nAre we in the newspapers could run the following headline every day one hundred and thirty seven thousand people have escaped from a salute publicity today and they could have run it for the last twenty five\nYears and he would be true um but to your point about the news cycle the but the problem is that good things tend to happen on a different time scales from\nBad things bad things tend to happen immediately and that's the way they use the A's whereas good things are incremental they improved slowly over long periods of time and uh consequently\nUm they don't like the the headlines are the headlines usually are if it bleeds it leads nonetheless we live in a world with the least amount of ... ever and for the first time of the\nBrookings Institution show last week or two weeks ago a loss that half of the world is middle class who would've thought\nHalf of the world out of what are we ready to seven billion or a billion already\nWelder seven and a half billion people in the world and what the Brookings Institution to it is to divide the world into four groups are the first group\nIs people who have an absolute policy that's below two dollars per person per day adjusted for a um a local prices are ... and the second group was between two dollars and eleven dollars\nThen the third group which is where the middle class begins loss of from eleven to\nA hundred and ten dollars and finally the full scope lost over a hundred and ten\nDollars per person per day and a roughly three point six billion people a fall into the category between eleven dollars and I'm I'm a hundred and ... and a over a hundred and ten dollars so um yeah for the first time in in in world history how the world is a middle class\nI'm Talking to Mario on to be who is the editor of human progress dot org I highly recommend the side and their Twitter feed and I've got no other dog in the fight I just look I I was talking to a reporter today and she said that your wife tells me that you're an optimist I said I Am an optimist I think most problems can be solved and things are getting better\nI'm I'm a big fan of ... who wrote the you know this guy or gal environmentalist\nBut you don't just focus on the numbers and on on dollars and cents you also focus on just the general improvement of the human condition can you give my audience or an example or two of how things are getting better you mentioned education\nMhm [noise] well I'm a first of all let me just say quickly that I don't think that you and I are made to be able to ... this is not about convincing people to be\nOptimists something of blind optimists it's about people being a real ... real is about having a realistic view of the world and the realistic view of the world is Renault where things are improving now when it comes to education a that's a that's a perfect example you know I'm\nA as late as the beginning of the of the of the twentieth century it was anyway or for people to receive more than a two or three years of education even in the most ah developed countries\nBruce and on on dollars and cents you also focus on just the general improvement of the human condition can you give my audience or an example or two of how things are getting better you mentioned education\nMhm [noise] well I'm a first of all let me just say quickly that I don't think that you and I are\nUsed to be able to ... this is not about convincing people to be\nOptimists sucking on blind optimist it's about people being ... about having a realistic view of the world and the realistic view of the world is well aware of things are improving now when it comes to education a that's a that's a perfect example you know I'm\nA as late as the beginning of the of the of the twentieth century it was ... for people to receive more than a\nTwo or three years of education even in the most uh a developed countries I'm now a education the primary education certainly so at least\nSeven or eight years a primary education is completely stand it and uh one of the reasons for why that happened last technological progress you said you liked acknowledged progress than I Do like doing little bark and one of the greatest inventions was closed the tractor\nA and a a mechanization of agriculture because for the first time in history I'm\nA farm owners didn't have to rely on that children are in order to the farm work um but we were able to keep the children at work while uh the the the head of the family or the farmer\nAbsolutely yeah um it's crazy I mean just in the lab and Thirteen Years from twenty twelve to twenty twenty five they won the average fuel of cars that are sold to go from twenty nine miles per gallon two fifty five as you said it's an almost of doubling and all the years we've had automobiles um\nAnd twelve Thirteen Years we're supposed to practically doubled fuel efficiency and what that does is as you said earlier they have to a vastly increased costs in order to implement technology things like hybrid vehicles which are vastly more expensive than traditional vehicles or they have to wait\nWait and they're doing both and the problem is is that um there's very little benefit for this this at thousands of dollars up to six thousand seven thousand dollars per price of an average vehicle by most estimates and the this is right now because there's not an energy shortage a gas can be a little bit\nLower right now that'd be nice but it's not because it's because the demand not because of supply the oil of\nA crisis of the seventies is over America's an energy giant now we have more reserves than ever so the rationales entirely gone the only rationale is to fulfill pretty much of a green agenda of leftist politicians have bureaucrats\nAnd pushing people out of cars so Gerard ... is this going to happen could we see the Trump Administration say\nThings like hybrid vehicles which are vastly more expensive than traditional vehicles or they have to wait\nWait and they're doing both and the problem is is that um there's very little benefit for this this ad thousands of dollars up to six thousand seven thousand dollars per price of an average vehicle by most estimates and this is right now because there's not an energy shortage a gas can be a little bit\nLower right now that'd be nice but it's not because it's because the demand not because of supply the oil of\nA crisis of the seventies is over America's an energy giant now we have more reserves than ever so the rationales entirely gone the only rationale is to fulfill pretty much of a green agenda of leftist politicians have bureaucrats\nAnd pushing people out of cars so Gerard ... is this going to happen could we see the Trump Administration say let's freeze the standards now\nWhen if you frozen standards wouldn't affect me if prices stopped going up on cars more people will buy newer cars more fuel efficient cars already because we know that a ten year old car is not going to get as good gas mileage as the one that's brand spanking new or you're too old\nIf we could stop that and just say let's just freeze the standards or has come as close to a freezes possible on all the new standards were pushing\nThe car companies to get there if we could reduce the cost of to the American family\nUh buying an automobile more of them would buy brand new ones that means more people would have new work cars a year or two or three or\nFive years old and we could reduce that Thirteen your average age back to something lower than that we'd get cleaner air we get more fuel efficiency and we wouldn't have to battered the consumer with these gigantic price increases\nAbsolutely not just the consumer but our auto makers their competitiveness our jobs are you know um our economy it hits it hits all the way down and the ridiculous ideas that as you said earlier because you've got to\nGet that average you're going to sell cars the smaller cars which are not as profitable but you want a skill away from the\nUh cars that are the bigger cars that are more comfortable and have more features that people want they'll actually increase the price of those to push people into our cars so it really skews the market at Scripps profitability or it\nYou know screws up all of the various ways that the economy should be running with consumer choice and the auto makers making vehicles that people actually want to drive\nAnd we're living in a gray days right now or technology is doing amazing things with a you know crash warnings and laying changing and break assessed and ... and all that good stuff that's making cars safer but with these crazy CAFE standards they're going to keep people out of these cars and they're going to hold onto their car much longer um\nWhich is not only less fuel efficient but it's also less safe\nWell and it and that's a big difference because they say when you get to smaller cars for every hundred pounds you trim off the car you say well that's more efficient they say it's also five percent more likely to kill you in a crash\nAnd and frankly I Know that they knew

there were another wealthy country between us and you have you with care man they went out there exactly right\nYeah they're just coming here because we're a wealthy country it's not because they

that and they are but you're right eventually the taxpayers will pay that price let me go to mark who's been hanging on a mark\nHey Joel thanks for taking my call and we do a\nGood thanks for all you do I'm just on this caravan coming up when I\nWas like I said it's happening right around this time with me in this round the corner and I just see if you use 'em by the Democrats just another way drive between voters and independence and\nTrump or being a racist and anti immigrant signed my concern is um or the Republicans and the president himself and it can be because of the pressure and the worry about that from election [noise]\nOh boy that's a great question that's my fear brother that's my fear 'cause I think this this cuts both ways\nUm if if Trump and the Republicans stand firm and again I just luck is and and the caller said it may be twenty minutes ago\nI I I'm not mean spirited and I'm not a bigot and I'm not in any kind of a folding I'm not a racist\nBut no dog gone it not you don't have a right to be here we have to enforce secure our borders you want to apply for asylum do with the right way to do with the legal way but you don't just show up at our door you don't just show up at our border\nNow for the life of me I don't know why Republicans are afraid to say what I just said Trump talks tough on this issue he backed down last time I wish she'd continue to talk tough\nAnd then I Hope he doesn't back down and I I I Wish the Republicans would join him but they're generally afraid of this issue let me go to Tom tom\nHey Joe ... thanks so you know I think we all have a lot of empathy for these refugees right I mean I I think everybody can kind of agree to that but you know I I don't necessarily agree with it with an earlier caller that there you know about the wealth of the nation right the last I Know we're in a deficit right yeah I mean I'm thinking about it every dollar we spend\nTo provide aid to pay the people that are processing down as a dollar we got to borrow\nRight and if you put it into that kind of perspective do we really want to borrow a dollar\nNo ... ... ... a look man you're right you're you're right what was our [laughter] we have to borrow money take care of these people\nAnd it's not a dollar that you and I are going to spend but it's a dollar that er\nAnd then I Hope he doesn't back down and I I I Wish the Republicans would join him but they're generally afraid of this issue let me go to Tom tom\nHey Joe ... thanks so you know I think we all have a lot of empathy for these refugees right I mean I I think everybody can kind of agree to that but you know I I don't necessarily agree with it with an earlier caller that there you know about the wealth of the nation right the last I Know we're in a deficit right yeah I mean I'm thinking about it every dollar we spend\nTo provide aid to pay the people that are processing down as a dollar we got to borrow\nRight and if you put it into that kind of perspective do we really want to borrow a dollar\nNo ... ... ... a look man you're right you're you're right and what was our [laughter] we have to borrow money take care of these people\nAnd it's not a dollar that you and I are going to spend but it's a dollar that our kids are going to have to spend yeah right and you multiply that by thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars yes you know it's it it just gets ridiculous and I think it's you know we got to wrap it up and there's some sort of perspective right that the next\nLogical sense that people can kind of just you know understand\nIt's got to stop it's got to stop\nAnd and uh by the way you don't need to say that we're\nWe're a big hearted people and and nobody who thinks like I Do needs to be defensive on this

Democrats and Republicans are acknowledging\nThat health care\nIs is the number one issue on the minds of voters this\nFall or in fact uh I've seen\nPoll after poll after poll after poll\nAnd every single poll after poll after poll after poll I've seen has\nHas said that to me that health care is number one and some number one issue usually followed by academy the jobs and on down the line\nBut it's health care health care and what's interesting is when I got elected in two thousand and ten\nHealth care was the issue that and specifically was Obamacare and in two thousand and ten when Iran in two thousand and twelve\nAnd then really two thousand and fourteen as well\nRepublicans were the ones talking about health care\nAnd Democrats\nDidn't want to mention that because of Obamacare was really unpopular\n'em\nAnd Iran and twenty ten and a bunch of Republican draining twenty ten and we promised to rip peel Obamacare\nYou remember all that you remember all of that don't you write\nJust give us control of of the house and Senate and baby we Republicans will repeal Obamacare\nRoute ten branch I think we set route and branch\nRight\nWell funny thing happened and oh by the way just so we're clear on the record\nWhen in fact a union voters view the voters\nWhen in fact you did in fact give Republicans the keys to Washington DC a couple of years ago\nRemember do you gave Republicans the house in the Senate and the White House\n\nYou remember they didn't repeal Obamacare did not\nWe'd been screaming for it and crying for for eight years I mean heck when I was in Congress when I got elected Republicans only controlled the house Harry Reid and the Democrats controlled the Senate Obama was in the White House\nThe very first vote I made in the house was to repeal Obamacare\nBut we knew it wouldn't go anywhere\nHuman voters view the voters\nWhen in fact you did in fact give Republicans the keys to Washington DC a couple of years ago\nRemembered you gave Republicans the house

Congress because of Obamacare I wouldn't have gotten elected if not for Obamacare the Republicans wouldn't have taken control of the house if not for Obamacare the Republicans wouldn't have taken control of the United States Senate and twenty fourteen if not for Obamacare\n[noise] now eight years later Democrats are actually trying to use Obamacare and health care\nTo take control of Congress again it has\nTotally flipped\n\nIncredible when you think about it\nWhat changed\nI mean we picked up sixty three house sixty three seats in the house in twenty ten ... we we picked up six seats in the Senate\nA major studies done back in twenty ten\n... made clear that House Democrats lost their seats because of their vote for Obamacare\nThe Tea Party an anti Obamacare movement thankfully swept

rid of this program or get rid of that program we'd cut spending baloney Republicans had no interest in doing any of that\nSo yeah\nYou gave the American people something in Obamacare and now the

[laughter] anyway so good morning Brennan on what shall we talk about this morning\nWell I Love the fact that uh you start off the morning by telling people that even though it's got and it's not quite as warm as it typically is people ought to be drinking water was in a regular basis and you know even you know obviously liver medic is a totally focused on reducing the toxins in the body and sort of repairing the digestive tract and that's kind of our focus\nA sort of monitoring and managing the amount of glucose and insulin in the blood and when it gets a you know when the glucose gets to hire the infant a glucose gets to lower incident gets too hot it's the one breaking down into when it's all the major store of like it just so\nIf the liver isn't properly working because we have a concentration of fat cells that are interrupting it's um proper management\nThen you're going to get a type two diabetic a type of influence and maybe you don't have full blown type two diabetes maybe your pre diabetic not maybe you're not even there they beat us have high fasting blood sugar but that is the stats and it's going to continue that trend if you don't reverse it so that's\nThat's the major ones as far as I'm fatty liver is concern of course you can go to the doctor and you can ask for liver ends on test and if it's high that's a clear indication where if you have um an ultrasound\nOr and you know you find something in there then you're you're kind of really progressed on that spectrum because typically\nIt's not going to catch a fatty liver until you're close to twenty percent concentration of fat cells within the liver which means you really well\nAh down that road to to um you know liberal on health or they want to back off that uh as quick as possible you definitely want to encourage people to be taking a product like about it but when it comes to leaky got\nThis is where things become a little bit more\nThe staff and it's going to continue that trend if you don't reverse it so that's\nThat's the major ones as far as I'm fatty liver is going to sort of course you can go to the doctor and you can ask for liver ends on test and if it's high that's a clear indication where if you have um an ultrasound\nOr and you know you find something in there then you're you're kind of really progressed down on that spectrum because typically\nIt's not going to catch a fatty liver until you're close to twenty percent concentration of fat cells within the liver which means you really well\nAh down that road to to um you know liberal on health I didn't want to back off that uh as quick as possible you definitely want to encourage people to be taking your product like a padded back when it comes to leak you got\nThis is where things become a little bit more difficult to identify so sometimes people say well you know there is a bunch of foods that I used to eat when I was younger but now that I'm older I have some problems digesting them so I kind of avoid them that's an indication\nUm there's people who have a ... a gas confrontation diarrhea that kind of stuff that's certainly an indication\nUh any pain obviously that's that's an easy one but essentially discomfort and sometimes we have folks not sometimes we do a lot of folks unfortunately that are in this category where they go to their doctor\nMhm and they'll tell them that they are suffering from depression that they have massive food sensitivities that it is they smell something like let's say a a woman were to enter an elevator and they got that same elevator and they are where we are a lot of perfume that's very effective if a man's got into an elevator he was wearing a lot of\nColumbus works both ways uh you know\nThey are very sensitive to that and they ended up having some sort of reaction to it those indications why is that because the leaky got eighty percent of your immune system's located down there\nSo if it gets triggered it doesn't just get triggered in your digestive tract gets triggered throughout your whole body it's not a local thing go whenever you come in contact and this is a also applies to personal healthcare product anything that you breathe than\nI that goes into your lungs your whole new system gets triggered so if you aren't sensitized to all these things you really need to focus on digestive health are and that sort of that sort of the key and I and I think a lot of folks when they think of digestive health and rightly so they think\nProbiotics gotta get my hands on good pro buyout which\nWe are a a big proponent of we don't we don't make any of them we\nFeel that there are lots of companies out there that to a wonderful job this we're not interested and I'm trying to compete in space with more interested in making products that\nUh aren't currently made and provide 'em a sort of a seal up a hole in the market so it would be one of the issues that we see with ... says they don't like to stick\nTo a wall that a either doesn't exist or is constant a battle zone so when you start taking a product like we could get repair that has things like\nAh immune suppressed there's\nA things to seal up uh opening like a think an MSN other ingredients in there\nAre and also help to promote your cultural secretion and other things to help line the digestive tracts the body can repair itself\nNow you're open to go out and get a nice ... and sort of re inoculate your digestive system so those things like candy to parasites can't a sort of a you know jump back into the apartment buildings and so it you know\n... says they don't like to stick to a wall that a is it doesn't exist or is constant a battle zone so when you start taking a product likely could go repair that has things like ah immune suppressed there's\nA things to seal up uh opening like a think an MSN and other ingredients in there\nAre and also help to promote your cultural secretion and other things to help line the digestive tracts the body can repair itself\nNow you're open to go out and get a nice ... and sort of re inoculate your digestive system so those things like candy to parasites can't\nA sort of a you know jump back into the apartment buildings and so you know to try and destroyed that got line it yet but you have to get it to the point where at least ... apartment buildings are now that you don't have broken windows and broken doors on it that's the way it sort of look at things\nLike an allergy [laughter] so ... what happens if we let it go I Know you've touched yeah so how is it that\nYeah I'm unfortunately if you go to conventional doctor and this is\nThey don't either approve of a natural approach or are they sort of whether to keep going and they said look you know you can go on a some additional antibiotics you can go on some uh we have some painkillers for you or if you have a liver issue will give you that form and this is one of the natural progression of saying\nThe pain killers will do additional damage that adjusted track I met foreman masks those things the antibiotics obviously there's just destroying your you know that the natural biome in there and people progressively have worse and worse liver problems\nThey have high cholesterol they have high blood pressure again because the body is trying to equilibrium itself and this is the way it does it\nIt can't properly monitored and regulate and manage a blood glucose so now you're a type two diabetic\nAh the cognitive declines increase because perhaps they'll put you on a stat and drug which reduces the fat in your body we all know that fat it be a major insulator for all their old growth so drove roast sort of a it's now at a standstill and any degradation that damage\nCannot be repaired so this is the reason why and I I Know that when I'm Talking or to the listeners out there they're saying oh my goodness you know I Know this\nI've seen this progression either with you know my grandparents for myself and my parents or whatever it is so this is what happens and we want to make sure that people have an out\nIt's not complicated this pathology is very easy to understand you can go deliver medical dot com and we have all of the articles written a ends going layman terms that people understand what the pathology here but the conventional docs they haven't caught up to this\nSo they'll put you on the pharmaceutical a track and it will be really difficult to get off and I know first hand because I was in the pharmaceutical industry\nAnd as soon as I figured out what was going on I laughed so don't hold it against me [laughter] I didn't know what I didn't know a but once I figured it out I laughed and he got into\nThe the natural alternative space so\nYou do need to address and I will say even for you know folks who may or may not feel a lot of The Simpsons or I Would say look\nProphylactic way um these toxins or in the environment they're in the foods\nYou eat organic wonderful you ever go out to eat at a restaurant you're getting it or if you have aluminum and your um deodorant if you have a fluoride in your toothpaste or you know I could go on and on anything that you put on your skin a Seventy five percent trans during all that stuff gets into your body\nReally difficult to get off and I know first hand because I was in the pharmaceutical industry and as soon as I figured out what was going on I laughed so\nDon't hold it against me [laughter] I didn't know what I didn't\nKnow a but once I figured it out I left and he got into the the natural alternative space so\nYou do need to address and I will say even for you know folks who may or may not feel a lot of the Simpson or I Would say look\nProphylactic way um these toxins or in the environment they're in the foods\nYou eat organic wonderful you ever go out to eat at a restaurant you're getting it\nOr if you have aluminum and your um deodorant if you have\nA fluoride in your toothpaste or you know I could go on and on anything that you put on your skin a Seventy five percent trans during all that stuff gets into your body and we do talk to five and I just told you about Ninety eight percent I Would just tell you but I'm going to Ninety eight percent of women\nWho um give birth when they do a test\nThey test uh one of the things that they they do try to identify as it was quite the same uh and they found that Ninety eight percent of women whether they eat right or not\nHave trace amounts of license plates in the body we know that that is a not a good thing for the fetus obviously because it does cross that a central a barrier show if\nIf women who are you know that they're pregnant on our eating healthy\nAfter ... life say in their system it's basically an everybody and they just said crisis they\nDisrupt the digestive tract and also inhibits she uh enzymes\nIn the liver to help us intoxicated so this is something that even if you're not suffering from all of these terrible thing um you need to take more or less ... a from a prophylactic standpoint and maintenance standpoint\nPrinted we're almost out at times can you wrap up any um points that you'd like to let listeners know in about one minute sure she works for sure\nSo uh I Would say most people a lot of focus on say justice health that would be the first place I Would start because that's the first domino or we can repair is one of the most successful products we have in our wind up uh in all of our products are made\nA ... or extremely clean we sell to of physicians and well educated health food stores like a healthy habit\nSo we are different from the rest of the industry the other thing that I Would say and this is more of a public service announcement is take a look at 'em you know go go to your bathroom take a look at all the products you have in there and make sure that they're clean\nYour deodorant your um your soaps your shampoos you were toothpaste and particularly in Arizona you have a high concentration of war naturally occurring makes sure utility has not dropping additional forward in your drinking water it's very dangerous it lowers IQ and it's highly toxic\nIn your drinking water it's very dangerous it lowers IQ and it's highly toxic right\nYes that side has died [laughter] sad stay right [laughter] yeah so\nUm so that's an end to else's serving I'm at the ... of a daily uh sauerkraut daily you know that's better than eating the whole bottle at one time\nYou know once once a week or once every two weeks and I have people call me and say oh my gosh I just ate the whole bottle what's\nGoing to [laughter] I feel really good and you're telling me that they're going to have a good trip to the bathroom\nNow tell us how how this sets it apart from just getting off the rack and the grocery store 'cause I Know it's a little bit different\nWell first and foremost we are local you know gay logo so um we're local and um [noise]\nA second all I I don't have any water to my ... I make the vegetables create their own brine and just so it's very nutrient jets are no um and there's you know um\nMany different recipes out there that support works for us and um I think part of that makes it more powerful also um we simulated ... salt putting minimum back into it I mean a lot of people say oh it's really salty and I use a little salt as possible um\nBut that's all it really helps um and also provide that extra layer of mineral a you know the works and for you um the more ... again and I'm the ingredients are intentional you met him really most importantly there is no vinegar in their ... and\nSo when you start getting into big and you have to mass produce and stuff then you've got to find ways to make it last longer and and so forth and um vinegar and pasteurized station or not bacteria as friends they kill the bacteria\n[noise] so how long does this process take for you well we're I think I'm so we process in a day will make 'em you know a couple of accidents than a day and let that ferment anywhere from four to eight eight week as\nWell as long as we can um which would start a new piece of equipment that really is designed to um make tower crawl to Cabot\nShredder we bought it I saw your video on it was really cute [laughter] excited about that\nPiece of equipment I still am um so I I've noticed that it's bringing out different colors and the

okay\nWe ... we had a gift on yesterday rabbi bureau and he was talking about\nI'm Jamal could show game this so called journalists from the Washington Post and the Washington Times uh yesterday and

the\nFour zero for six six when you're on the\n\nShow broadcasting live from Las Vegas today the weather's beautiful out here so we're going to be speaking at an event at five o'clock\nAnd seven thirty this evening and then it I Believe at the ten o'clock hour or two we may have to do something different on the show tomorrow but let's see we'll see what happened\nSo we got did get confirmed that are burning the wall will be in Washington DC at the end of the month and they're just trying to get the date on it but they work and find that they are going to get a hundred thousand away\nTo a department of homeland security in what they did you know and I'm going to take them a real quick I finished the point because um you know the departments aren't\nUm they're not set up to ... the money now that Iran is they're they're set up to receive money but none of the other agencies are and that's pretty neat thing what they did\nGetting their water together where they can actually give the department of homeland security which is what they're doing with the crowd funding so they're partnering with and this is part of what President Trump was talking about\nWhen he said that there should be some kind of partnership between\nThe business\nThat are burning the wall will be in Washington DC at the end of the month and they're just trying to get the dates on it but they were confirmed that they are going to give that a hundred thousand away to a department of homeland security and what they did do you know and I'm going to say something oh real quick I finished the point\nBecause um you know the departments aren't um they're not set\nUp to receive money now the IRS is they're they're set up to receive money but none of the other agencies are and that's a pretty neat thing what they did get in their lawyers together where they can actually gift the department of homeland security which is what they're doing with the crowd funding so they're partnering with and this is part of what President Trump was talking about\nWhen he said that there should be some kind of partnership between\nThe\nBusiness world and the government for a lot of these projects especially rebuilding America and there's a lot of money out of here so why are we spending\nBillions hundreds\nOf billions of dollars every year in China to rebuild their country\nI mean the war's over a long time ago and those were the policies that we still go by today and I don't know why we're doing that but I think things are going to change your under President Trump we shouldn't be building\nSouth Korea we shouldn't be rebuilding the European countries anymore or\nMexico or Canada none of them we should be rebuilding the United states of America now President Trump said this morning that\nUh if these countries\nAre Latin American countries continue to send their people up here and let them come then they're going to cut off funding that includes Mexico of the money that we give them every year to help them out and I think that's fair why should we give them money to help them build their economies\nAnd let all the people come in that want to come\nFor economic asylum political asylum all that good stuff to the tune of about a hundred and thirty five billion dollars a year and that's not including what it cost us for\nPutting them away in jails when they goof up over here and act crazy and don't want to assimilate and become Americans anyway it's all craziness out there getting back to the walk of the White House story here so fund the wall\nAnd it's going to be there towards the end of this month they're going to get a hundred thousand dollars away we've been invited to be there will let you know the exact date\nOr if we're going to make that trip but hopefully we do need to be very exciting for the fly Mackey show to be able to do something like this we're very excited anyway that was ... I was asked them questions and I talked about it a little bit yesterday\nAbout um the kind of show we have um\nKnow how we get our stories how we report are stored who gives us a story and we as citizens report so I explained\nIn these fifty questions about the fly Mackey show being on eleven hundred camping acts with fifty thousand watts accent or having seven million people under armed Brelo being around for decades and decades so it's it's you know it's a great station to me on the great family here\nBut they were asking me questions trying to get very specific on exactly how we come up with our stories because we've broken and this is where they really wanted to find out how do we break here fly Mackey shows I Can't believe the fat little and then it gets to do this stuff and they still blows me away\nHow we've been able to break\nAbout um the kind of show we have um you\nKnow how we get our stories how we report are stored who gives us our stories and we have citizen to report so I explained\nIn these fifty questions about the fly Mackey show being on eleven hundred camping acts with fifty thousand ... having seven million people under our umbrella being around for decades and decades so it's it's you know it's a great station to be on the great family here\nBut they were asking me questions trying to get very specific on exactly how we come up with our stories because we've broken and this is where they really wanted to find out how do we break here fly Mackey shows I Can't believe the fat little and then it gets to do this stuff and they still blows\nMe away how we've been able to break five national news stories when you've got\nThousands and thousands of other broadcast out there and news agencies here in the United states not including the big boys and the big girls that didn't break those stories before we did in how we were able to do it so I explained to them and are broken down question by question or answer my answer of how we have citizen reporters\n... read these reporters that we have what they do is they go out and they look for the facts\nWe have liberal reporters we are conservative reporter and we have constitutional type ... when I say that this is a mindsets behind these people that are reporting for us they're not for or against anything they're not for president they're not against President Trump\nThey don't have that mentality even though I can say there's\nA couple of those stories that we broke came from a liberal friends are liberal with ... that were out there that just reported the facts\nSo as I put was given the facts I put them together and wrote\nThe story and then I gave it out and I told them by the way here's what the story's going to look like they approve the story 'cause they wrote it in a lot of these citizen reporters don't want to be recognized or given credit for the stories so we get here flying a climax dot com\nA flight TV accent or on your on the radio or I get to take credit for the stories even though I'm not the one doing the investigating research on okay so we're very proud and why broken down\nOr about um how we do these stories\nEtcetera so anyway we'll see what happens we're trying to get some Prescott dancers cause they asked us if we wanted press credentials for some of these\nEvents that President Trump does and would we be willing to travel I'm like\nYes [laughter] so we're waiting is pending will say we're going to get any kind of credentials but we're very excited about this because we're not in a um\nI guess we're not the typical news station etcetera etcetera etcetera but we do our best to reporting the news as we get it fit corn today let's do a little bit of news this morning so what was talking about the disruptive and this is what I'm going to talk a lot a little bit about\nThis evening and tomorrow of the block chain and why it is called disruptive what exactly is happening with the block chain where do they come from how long has it been around and what does it do for you well\nA lot of the the number one thing I guess you could say in simple language is it a verification platform to verify who you are what you have\nWhat kind of identification comes\nYes we are not the typical news station etcetera etcetera etcetera but we do about that reporting the news as we get it fit calling today let's do a little bit of news this morning so what was talking about the disruptive and this is what I'm going to talk a little bit about\nThe saving and tomorrow of the block chain and why it is called disruptive\nWhat exactly is happening with the block chain where do they come from how long has it been around and what does it do for you well\nA lot of the the number one thing I guess you could say in simple language is it the verification platform to verify who you are\nWhat you have\nWhat kind of identification comes with you and we're that identification comes from a can that be verified and\nSo then it gets verified through\nThe block chain where whoever you're trying to do business with them you're trying to do business with a gas station or the grocery store or any coffee place or some kind of\nClothing outlet or ants are paid here in Arizona for a P. S. or the banks\nIt's a verification system that cannot be duplicated when I say duplicate it I mean it cannot be changed it can be duplicated that's the whole point of it is to duplicate it it can't be changed so let's say in\nYour little area where you live in your ten block area or\nYour one mile area quarter mile area you could break it down any way you want\nThere's hundreds and hundreds of people the programmers they get on the block chain anybody can get on the block to and you have to get verified first but you get on the block chain and it's a race to see who can verify that information that you're trying to put out who you are\nThis is why it's disruptive why because it's going to knock merchant process and completely out of the ball game that is going to be a dead industry anyway let me get back to this real quick know get to who's going to get knocked out in the ballpark here\nAre in now will be able to play anymore at least a in a limited form anyway so\nOnce they verify who you are\nThat is a permanent record\n... nobody can get in got it got a couple of minutes we're going to go out for the second segment so they cannot get in and change that now\nYou've got hundreds and hundreds of people and thousands and this is going to create millions and millions of jobs merely that's why the disruptor a people who are willing to go on and verify for a little bit of crypto currency dust\nSo nobody's going to be able to get on and get rich during the transferred but what they can do learn a living\nAnd they don't care who you or what you're doing they just want a barrel by that the information that you're putting out that's trying to be received is true want this verified then it goes out to the no ... in the note says hey I did it\nAnd that means nobody else can touch it and then at that point the note puts it out to the world than a block has been verified and once that block has been verified the world knows\nNobody's going to be able to get on and get rich doing transferred but what they can do learn living\nAnd they don't care who you are what you're doing it I just want to ban by that the information that you're putting out that's trying to be where he said is true wanted verified then it goes out to the no ... in the note that hey I did it\nAnd that means nobody else can touch it and then at that point the note put it out to the world that a block has been verified and what that block has been verified the world knows\nI'll get to that and the second like what you don't have but what I'm Talking about here is listen eighty percent of all these wallets who have crypto currency and it was Pacific Lee bitcoin had never been touched after that initial purchase what does that mean that means there's an awful lot of folks out there like you\nWho\nBelieve that bitcoin is going to be the money in the future or at least gonna be a store house or a store value of the future like a bank\nOh thank you baby Jesus man [laughter] it's going to be like a bank that's the easiest way to put it\nOr like a very valuable home on the block everyone wants to limit but they have to live in the house because guess who got it you got it so it's become very valuable that's why at this stage right here you want to do your best to get position ... all one\nNow what's the significance of all of this what does this matter do well I'll tell you\nNot to the banking business is ever going to go out they're not stupid and they got smart they started putting their money into the online and wallets\nIs they're going to be Cassius cash going to go away no cash going to be around for a long time forever probably who knows but we're moving into the digital world and what does that mean for you well the Internet was never set up\nNever it was never set up to have a for\nAll the passwords that we have to him it was set up for one password you use set up a password year on after that it was never set up for all these applications and all these sites\nJust thinking of all your passwords and all your sites all the hacking goes on because it's so simple to hack these little computers now earlier I was talking about\nThe security of the block chain and why it's so important let's get to that\nBecause you have\nThousands hundreds of thousands and millions of people that are getting on the block chain to help make these transactions okay that's number one so it\nWas\nA transaction\nOr some information is verified it goes out to us\nNever it was never set up to have a\nFor all the passwords that we have to him it was set up for one password you use set up a password year on after that it was never set up for all these applications and all these sites just thinking of all your passwords and all your side all the hacking goes on because it's so simple to hack\nThese little computers now earlier I was talking about the security of the block chain and why it's so important let's get to that because you have\nThousands hundreds of thousands and millions of people that are getting on the block chain to help make these transactions okay that's number one so it\nWas a transaction or some information is verified it goes out to all the nose in all the computers get it then I'll get it what does that mean what that means that you would have to go in and hack\nFifty one percent of those thousands hundreds of thousands and millions of computers\nEach and every one of them all with different addresses different connections et cetera et cetera et cetera this way past the pay grade of today's conversation today show to get into all this\nBut what I'm trying to tell you is the security of the block chain in bitcoin specifically is going to change\nThe way that we are trained Zach verify who we are credit oh boy that's a big one we're going to get to that in the second second what you have\nAnd are making transactions\nWhere nobody's going to be able to get in and hack that permanent ledger\nI'm telling you what if you get yourself position [laughter] it's gonna be awesome what's gonna happen to places like Google what's gonna happen to play\nTo companies like Facebook and Twitter well there'll be a there'll be companies in the past don't things are going to be around forever\nWhy do you think Google is making a play for China because they know their days are ended they're coming to an end it was going to be a disruption because why those companies on the block pain now already there called de centralized companies were the people are in control\nNot a CEO not a corporate office not a political view\nIs based on fact and information there's other sites coming up white tea and see it\nJust the way the day is coming Google will be a name of the past Sunday at least here in the United states they're already making deals with China\nAnd it's crazy you out and do your research on that Facebook Twitter where they censor what you say it's the craziest thing in the world and get censored anyway we're going to talk about some stories coming up\nFake watching God they continue to make it no how about like what you have so you get dressed you look good you put on some nice 'cause you get in a house that you can't afford a car you can't afford the model all kinds of money on credit you look good not I'm not putting anybody down I'm just saying this is what our credit\nAnd the fake ... behind that does to us\nIt creates more credit but it gives no substance behind your wealth the block change going to say people are going to be able to go on businesses and go hey\nThere's average Joe and there's average Jane we know they make this much we know they live there we know they pay their bills we know they're buying this cat at this gas station and this grocery store at this coffee shop and this clothing store\nAnyway we're going to talk about stories coming up\nBy what you got they continue to make it now how about like what you have to get grant you look good you put on tonight you get in a house they can't afford a car you can't afford you bought all kinds of money on credit you look good not I'm not putting anybody down and just saying this is what our credit\nAnd the fake net behind that does to us\nIt creates more credit but it gives no substance behind your well the block change going to say people are going to be able to go on businesses and go hey\nTheir average Joe and their average Jane we know they make that much we know they lived there we know they pay their bill we know they're buying this gas at this gas station and

know those of you listening to show for a long time no we don't really talk much politics because you know I've said off and on the show certainly in the past\nI've come to the conclusion that we've created a political problem in this country to which there is not a political solution\nAnd we spend all of our time worrying about what's happening in Washington or Phoenix or wherever it may be instead of focusing on living our lives and taking care of the people the institutions that are important to us\nI think that a lot of it just becomes somewhat wasted energy and one of the reasons I think the understanding how the financial world works is it gives you the ability to build an income to build wealth for yourself or your family your church synagogue jump all whatever it may be\nBut you can do that without having to get caught up in all of the the viciousness\nThat has become the system but I Do want to talk a little bit of politics today simply because it it how it's going to I

I remember it was an August and I'm thinking of a two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on talking about how people were losing trust in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was there were only two groups\nAnd and this was before ... and by the way 'cause I remember that part of it or whatever that you know a few months before that so they rate\nWhat they're only two institutions that more than half the people in this country had faith in one of which was the military at Seventy seven percent\nAnd the other was cops at about fifty two percent and one of the points I made was and again this was pretty Ferguson is you know there was a lot of pressure already be put on kind of people's views of cops and that may not be holding given that it was only fifty two percent back then and that would have very important implications\nI Want the country to work okay but I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if they're right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives are going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just because I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the classroom and to be teaching is before the crash and the idea this classes and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is before the market goes down you gotta know what you're going to do when\nThe country to work okay but I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and

the crash and the idea that this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is\nBefore the market goes down you got to know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up\nBut the average retail trade or will never make money in the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I've given us a lot of thought to about you know people keep coming in and told me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors will define investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realize that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble\nThey put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong and again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is is that when the market turned down a can turn down very quickly\nIf you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of games think about this from it Thirteen Years of games in a year and a half okay\nIf you want Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now\nHow is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down then you can on the move up so again in classroom and talk about all these ideas we're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people focus on what's called technical analysis they're using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked winter like four okay you know you have your ... in your are your uh see the eyes and ears on hold for thousands or hundreds of these things right\nSo how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got they won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kinda figured out that once you're about eight days out your four cats is really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be\nYou're only looking at averages ... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got a I won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecasters really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now\nAnd the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes [laughter] and that's a lot of this is that people used something because it's the best they think they've got but it's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market is supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make this a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but we always make sure that when we wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing as opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do\nSo again

going public this year eighty three percent of them are losing money now that is the highest in recorded history\nAnytime they've tracked that this is the biggest number of it's ever been is now a clipped what was happening in the year two thousand or eighty one percent of the companies were not profitable when companies are going public and then the stocks are going up which many of these stocks are where there are these ridiculous evaluation\nThere were known as unicorn stock these companies that have no profits that are worth a billion dollars or more\nThat is a sign of a bubble and that is a sign that we are closer to the end than we are to the beginning of this Ron\nThere's another story I just read that Charles Schwab investors which a classic retail traders are now sitting on less cash than they've been at any time in history so they are becoming quote unquote fully invested well that is a lot of implications what drives the market\nCourt in history anytime they've tracked this this is the biggest number of it's ever been is now a clipped what was happening in the year two thousand or eighty one percent of the companies were not profitable\nWhen companies are going public and then the stocks are going up which many of these stocks are where there are these ridiculous evaluation\nThere were known as unicorn stock these companies that have no profits that are

Schwab investors which a classic retail traders are now sitting on less cash than they've been at any time in history so they're becoming quote unquote fully invested well that is a lot of implications what drives the market is supply and demand if you've taken away the demand\nAnd there isn't more money on the sidelines to kind of come in and then what is going to take the market up to the next level\nNow what's been taking it up is companies buying back their own stock and companies are buying back a record amount of stock this year they never bought so much and that constrains supply and that could drive this market higher again\nThis is a I don't want to be giving you some big doom and gloom in this market can keep going higher than the repatriation of all that money coming back from overseas\nIs a huge part of what's driving this market higher now it's a one time deal but some of the people aren't spending the money this year that could spend it next year so maybe you got a little bit left in the tank next year but at some point it has to come down and again we need to be prepared for that before it happened\nWe got to have the fundamental skills to be able to benefit when this happens\nBecause you can actually make more money faster on the downside than the upside but at a minimum we've got to know how to protect what we've got\nSo again the Klan someone to be teaching on before the crash what do you do and also what we're going to cover is what does he keeps going up what should we be doing there's always a way to make money in this market

we were in January kind of gone back and forth around there\nYou know I said we could have one more run this year and you could look anything's possible you could even get a bit of a run next year but

could have one more run this year and you could look anything's possible you could even get a bit of a run next year but what's going to keep taking this market higher and in the last segment I told you a little bit about what I see an evidence of the top and the market\nOne is the fact that more companies are going public selling shares initial\nPublic offering demand pop cattle more companies that have no profits\nThan ever in history so Wall Street journal today to the eighty three percent of the company's going public right now have an earnings have gone public the last twelve months no earnings in two thousand the height of the dot com it was eighty one percent so that again is kind of big bubbly sign\nNext big bubbly sign that the fact that you go to a place like Charles Schwab where it's retail traders not professionals okay they have their customers have less cash sitting on the sidelines than they've had an ad I think at any time in history if I remember correct\nBut they don't have a lot of extra money now you combine that with something else we've talked about before on the show which is what's called margin debt\nRight now in this country people are barred about six hundred and sixty billion dollars to buy stocks that's about three and a quarter percent of gross domestic product the entire US Economy\nSo what's happening is people are taking the money they have been buying stocks because most people are massively behind the eight ball you know and soft and the other day\nThat if you look at people even in their sixties\nThe average person had something like a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and assets okay hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars is going to get you anywhere with all due respect in retirement\nTo really get to where most people need to be you're talking millions which means most people aren't going to get where they need to be you can still do better but you know most people are going to be in the hole on that a hundred and Seventy five it's not close\nBut what's amazing about it it's almost all equity in houses now part of a drive in the equity in houses is\n... ... real estate the mortgage rates are so low but they're going up and here's kind of again of big key in the\nTop when you have this much margin debt what happens is is that as people borrow more and more money to buy stocks so like when you buy stock you don't have to put up all the money just put up half of it\nOr you borrowed the rest of it well as their stocks go up in value you get more borrowing capacity so you don't actually have to solve the stocks so all this money gets created and that creates demand\nOpioid addiction shattered too many lives and broken the hearts of too many family it's time for toughness and resolve\nIn

labor market financial system market size business uh uh innovation et cetera et cetera et cetera\nAll good things right\nIt's where the most competitive economy for the first time in a decade that's what this means\nIt is the now the most competitive country in the world number one\nAt the ... the world Economic Forum\nDid add a little ...\nThey said well we could still do better on social issues and you can Kiss My edible snakes because I think everything's just just the way it is people are free to do what they want\nAnd if you don't like it mind your own business\nI just don't understand why freedom and so hard to get for people\nLike the government does not have to socially beyond your loves when you don't have to do people don't understand\nFreedom of people I think there are people out there who are willing\nBeijing et cetera et cetera et cetera all good things right\nIt's where the most competitive economy for the first time in a decade that's what this means\nIt is the now the

they don't understand freedom they think that freedom means that the government guaranteed your right to happiness not your pursuit of happiness government doesn't even guarantee that you can pursue something that you all you want to\nBut there's no guarantee that you're going to be happy\nIf you just have the freedom to pursue it\nPeople think freedom mean comfortable and this and they think freedom means everything is perfect and nothing's wrong in my life and I think that some some of these people I just don't think that they have an idea of what reality or freedom is\nYou do what you want to do someone else is going to do what they want to do\nDied the idea that a freedom that some of these individuals have is if someone else is doing something that I don't like the neck not freedom\nBecause they're not doing what I Want because they don't believe how I think they should believe because they don't talk how I Want them to talk they don't use the pronouns that I Want them

to have Trump if you've been something negative about it as\nOh yeah I mean I don't I don't get why people would would do that but that's that's the thing that they say\nThey talked to are they warned about a ... a brewing\nTrade war between the United states and China they say they're still room for improvement we're number one if you went first year last\nSo that goes\nTo cities we named market

anyway so the uh\nAside from the little caveat that they had\nAware and they think well we need to you know aside from your social issues ... first off we're doing great economically I think we're pretty good on social issues as well\nIdea of being free with social issues is government regulation of people's behavior\nBeyond don't murder people\nThat's that's that's what they believe it's freedom\nWhich is completely the opposite\nSometimes I feel like the world is just one giant black mirror episode you know what I mean [noise]\nI'm waiting to see if what I said on social media triggered anybody\nI'm sure yes there's the triggering the triggering has commenced\nI really I'm just I'm really read form and there's today\nI'm going to talk about this more coming up but I I

to want to keep playing ... as a junior is to take away the same opportunity from those younger players that was a forward it to him\nAs he was supposed to be taking working on his game and what you

lifestyle for a long time on some of the apartment complexes going after a few more right now\nAnd has been helping people diligently even before he was on the mentoring team so Scott\nI'm gonna ask you the probably the hardest question to ask any mentor\nAnd I don't know sixty days enough for you to come up with a robot answer but maybe just you're eight years of helping people's friends throughout lifestyles may give you a good sense of where I'm going with this and that is what every new mentors I said you know how do you grade yourself as a mentor\nAnd [noise] it's really difficult because you know they said well I Want to grade myself into whatever has failed deal\nAnd you can err on that side by saying OK I'm just going to say no to everything the easiest thing for a mentor to do is to say no to everything\nOr you'll never be wrong no one will ever come back at you and say you were you man you were wrong and that's what I Love it but uh the other side we have the other kind of mentor Scott or we have a few of these guys that are just um I don't come to the right word for it so it's not solving a there\nThey really really really really really want to help you get what you want to the point where maybe they're not using enough of their own personal um ...\nConservative this to shine them from making them yeah restraint and and being able to say you look I Know you really want this I noticed when really you know you really like this\nIt's really difficult because you know he said well I Want to create myself that no one ever has a failed deal\nAnd you can err on that side by saying OK I'm just going to say no to everything the easiest thing for a mentor to do is to say no to everything\nOr you'll never be wrong no one will ever come back at you and say you were you man you were wrong and this one I Love that but uh the other side we have the other kind of mentor Scott a we have a few of these guys that are just um I don't come the right word for it so it's not solving a there they really\nReally really really really want to help you get what you want to the point where maybe they're not using enough of their own personal um ...\nConserve and is this designed them from making yeah restraint and and being able to see how you look I Know you really want this I noticed when really ... you know you really like this but there's quite a few things\nThat you know the red flags go up to her in the back of my next going up this just doesn't seem like the ideal for you um you know there's that balance in the middle where Ninety nine percent of the ... people put your deals end up doing good ones the other one percent of people that don't listen to how to do it why don't you tell me how to do it uh that's the perfect\nAnd then the final indicator is okay how many people by retired and made millionaires out of that's good that's a good score card\nAnd how many people that I've consulted it become national park association winters so I haven't had this conversation with you because you've been so busy since you got here and I've been so busy last couple of weeks also have you thought about any of those parameters constraints as to how you would grade yourself personally as a consultant\nWow I really haven't thought of that you know you hit on a lot of things there that I have seen it sixty days and I've thought about sixty days but I hadn't thought about the overall kinda what do you want your legacy to be a deal and in this uh in what I'm doing now um I can tell you that\nWhen I Am working with people and I've done this and this is part of the lifestyles culture that we try to kind of pushed through and when and\nIf if you talk about people who are doing exactly what we're doing syndicating deals buying deals whatever outside of lifestyle so many times I was in this conversation yesterday\nThose guys make all their money up front on fees and things for putting that deal together and they really don't have a vested interest in what the long term successes or any particular deal\nBecause we invest in every deal that we do in addition to taking other people's money I really look at this and and Curtis did a great job and they multifamily orientation session of talking about the family office and that's kind of a new thought that you play in my head and really figuring out how to maximize my net worth and in effect grow it\nAnd so I look at every deal that way whether\nOr not in it now that I'm a mentor and so the two smaller deals that I've mentor people on there were no brainer sin and when I mentioned before sometimes you got to give them a little shut off the cliff\nThat's what these war they were first deals for these folks but when I looked at him it was like as if you don't make a decision to do this I got twenty other people I'm sure that I Know we'll do this today\nAnd uh and then I took a venture jumped and they're going to be great [noise] um the hundred and sixty four you will\nAlways got Scott ... just so you have the ... that are using the today I called the cattle prod mood you know what do you do with someone who won't take action hit him with the cattle pride and what does that and I used to say it all the time is if you don't do this I'm going to do it or I'm going to give it to somebody else but we're not going to let this would get away so I've always called that have had a ... move\nOkay sorry to a hundred or a hundred and sixty four year deal was one that we had to finance a little bit we had to do a little deeper analysis it wasn't so obvious a good deal um and we ... we had to work at a little bit before we came to grips unfortunately Roger having run his own business and being in six am ideals are so far he's very\nBut when I looked at him it was like as if you don't make a decision to do this I got twenty other people behind you that I Know we'll do this today and uh and then they could potentially jumped and they're going to be great [noise] um the hundred and sixty four you will\nAlways got Scott I'm actually share with you just so you have the ... that are using the today I called the cattle prod mood you know what do you do with someone won't take action hit him in the ... what does that and I used to say it all the time is if you don't do this I'm going to do it or I'm gonna give it to somebody else but we're not going to let this would get away so I've always called that have had all ...\nOkay so you're not going to a hundred and sixty four year deal was one that we had to finance a little bit we had to do a little deeper now says it wasn't so obvious a good deal\nUm and we ... we had to work at a little bit before we came to grips unfortunately Roger having run his own business and being in six am ideals are so far he's very smart very good at at analyzing the numbers\nAnd uh we got through that but it took a little bit of work then that brings us to the the one that I'm working on this afternoon which is the out of town deal\nUm this one doesn't help that it's not in the Houston market where I've been act or\nYou know active for ten years now and I pretty well known sub markets and things like that this one I had to do a little homework on and when he first brought back as an initial analysis I found some things that\nI thought he was trying to favor the deal a little too much and I did have pulling back and say you know my job is to keep you out of a bad deal and here are the concerns that I have he's gone back and massage some of that we've gotten a more farm alone quote which can substantially affect the deal\nAnd so we are going to take another run at it this afternoon so I have seen a little bit of the spectrum I guess in ... deals develop I haven't had a deal yet uh we had one on a a acquisition road trip that a few people were\nPretty heavy on and I did that we can get very deep into it but I came out on the road trip and I said the steel too rich there's not enough upside\nTo this deal to make it worth their while and we and we pulled a couple of people off of that deal um but fortunately we didn't get all without uh due diligence and get everybody's hopes up to invested in the deal but that's that's the biggest problem sometimes you get people that are doing or steel and they're emotionally\nInvested in them and it's hard for them to let go and and that's where I Do see my kind of position here is to make sure that people don't get a little too anxious or lose some patience and make sure the good deal comes along because it took me\nNine months before I got my first deal on a contract and I was completely walk in the gray line between unemployed and self employed for those nine months so uh I was definitely anxious and Emory ah Jacob had to hold me back from doing a bad deal at that time so I've never forgotten that\nYou're not remember the during the rise and so forth you were you an interesting personality your personality fears and nothing\nBut yet you're very analytical and I've had conversations with you and you know after our conversations where it's been like man the worlds coming to an end in we better be careful and then another conversation with you you know what I'm going to go do something way out here over left field we've never done before because I just think it's interesting that my my really pay off\nSo you you got a lot of ah versatility in your personality for being able to consult people\nI Want to ask you next question though and that is this um about a year ago maybe six months I Can't remember time flies you know the last\nCouple of months ago on very quickly but we were sitting over gee Alexander's one day and you were kind of like you were kind of pulling back saying you know I don't know I'm really kinda the point where I might not do any more deals and uh I might just start buying partners out in in you know changing my position more like yours do ... more of it\nDo something way out here over left field but we've never done before because I just think it's interesting that my my really pay off so you you got a lot of ah versatility in your personality for being able to consult people\nI Want to ask you next question though and that is this a year ago maybe six months I Can't remember type ... you know the last couple of months ago on very quickly but we were sitting over gee Alexander's one day and you were kind of like you're kind of pulling back saying you know I don't know\nI really kind of at the point where it might not do any more deals and or I might just start by Partridge out and and you know changing my position more like you're dealt with oil ... more of it\nAbsolutely now I'm going to throw in another ... along those same lines and\nI'm going to put words in your mouth which I knows when sanitary but look at it from this point of view about the time that all this came about you found this deal out of eased back where you used to live and it was a good excuse for you to go visit your family\nAnd friends from the past um we started really taking off nationally lifestyles we started doing deals all over the country\nAnd then the concept came to his for the first time ever that you know what all these years people have been coming from all over the country to come to Texas to buy\nAnd we own quite a few properties in Texas I don't know what percentage I'm not going to even guess what percentage I don't know how many units do not have you know yes but it's a lot of properties a lot of unions\nAnd we thought about you know what we're doing now is that we've we've created a very sophisticated base of investors in all taxes\nAnd then we started thinking what would it be like to take the money and the sophistication and the experience that we've accumulated in this group and taken some podunk town has no money no sophistication no nothing or\nWithout being insulted at least they have less experience than we do and to be able to throw that these properties in the markets outside of the Texas market area\nAnd uh you nailed one\nWe've had four or five others have gotten nailed in the last couple of months\nAnd all of a sudden I think what you're going to start seeing in fact I've already seen it is it instead of people come in the road trips in Houston people are flying out of Houston and Dallas and San Antonio in going to Michigan and going to Detroit Michigan are you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to Phoenix and going to uh you know all these different places we had these deals\nAnd they're now saying we've opened up a new can of worms here Scott and I you know you see that I think you're feeling that and I think that might have been part of the reason you got invigorated again\nIt absolutely so ah and you're absolutely right my wife and I are for two and a half years that we were married we lived in Cincinnati, Ohio when she got out of grad school that was whereabouts opportunity was so we moved there for a little\nAnd to be able to throw that these properties in the markets outside of the Texas market area and uh you nailed one\nWe've had four or five others have gotten nailed in the last couple of months\nAnd all of a sudden I think what you're going to start seeing in fact I've already seen it is it instead of people come in the road trips in Houston people are flying out of Houston and Dallas and San Antonio in going to Michigan and going to Detroit Michigan are you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to being seen going to um you know all these different places we had these deals\nAnd they're now saying we've opened up a new can of worms here Scott and I know you see that I think you're feeling that and I think that might have been part of the reason you got invigorated again\nIt absolutely so ah and you're absolutely right my wife and I are for two and a half years that we were married we lived in Cincinnati, Ohio when she got out of grad school that was whereabouts opportunity was so we moved there for a little while before we moved back to Houston and\nBeginning of last year I had went on a big junk mail a campaign and so I started an subscribing to all these things to creep into your mailbox overtime for signing up for various things and I sit on the couch with a a football game or something on he was on the other end of the couch down whatever she was doing on her laptop\nAnd I was an subscribing and deleting all this junk mail and one of the things that happened they are a which is one of the big brokers here in town and they are national\nOr had gotten bought by Cantor Fitzgerald and when that happened I had been on their website and I had set preferences so I only got deals and the Houston metropolitan area at the time that I started doing this I said why would anybody have to leave a city like Houston there's so much opportunity here to do any of this\nAnd I had I stated rule that if I couldn't drive to it and be home\nBy the end of the day I didn't need to own\nSo ah anyway as I'm sorting and and I didn't batch delete I was just hitting delete delete delete scrolling through the subject lines the Cincinnati deal pops up\nAnd I went huh and I clicked on it and I very quickly from looking at so many deal sized up that if this was in Houston, Texas it was a no brainer and they would sell for a lot more than the price was on this a posting that I saw\nAnd so yeah I asked my wife what do you think about finance deal out of town and we got a business excuse to go fly up there a couple times a year and see all those friends that were left behind Twenty years ago when we came back to Houston\nThat she sent out whatever you want to do if you want to manager said but it means that I've never had to do this but I'm probably gonna be gone at least one night a month going up there just to make sure everything's still running right she said that's fine you know our our two girls were out of the house by this time and we just have one kid left there so things are manageable if you'd like to try and do it so we ended up doing it\nUm I went to my three a kind of largest investors that have long term vision and I said guys a little bit of a flyer but while you're back you know the steel and they were all in\nAnd we did the deal is been phenomenal the ah we bonded since August of last year\nWe're on pace to return Nineteen percent cash on cash and our first year of ownership Brennan interest only period so things are\nObviously cash along really well but it's a fifty five and over high you'll play a property not not a a value play that we're having fixed up\nAnd we kept saying management group in fact it was a neutron and we're really well so I saw no reason to shake things up there we put it a little bit of ... and we're making it even more efficient so that when the principal kicks and our cash on cash probably won't have to tip\nWill just a cover it with our increased rats that we are getting out of this place\nSo uh that's a great place I was actually up there about three weeks ago I guess and they\nReally wanted one of my investors who is from Battle Creek Michigan founded a lifestyles on the radio show and came down here to invest they wanted him at the Detroit road show that you guys had about three weeks ago and he couldn't be there so I got to go up and be surrogate and help out and really kinda tell his story and how we met down here and now we're investing in other markets up there and I got to tell you a J. B.\nThe cash flowing really well but it's a fifty five and over high your play a property not not a a value play that we're having fix up\nAnd we kept saying management group in fact it was a neutron and we're really well so I sort of reasons to shake things up there we put it a little bit of cap action or make it even more efficient so that when the principal kick sand or cash on cash probably won't have to tip\nWill just a cover it with our increased threats that we are getting out of this place so uh that's a great place I was actually up there about\nThree weeks ago I guess and they really wanted one of my best friend who was from Battle Creek Michigan founded a lifestyles on the radio show and came down here to our best and wanted him at the Detroit road show that you guys had about three weeks ago and he couldn't be there so I got to go up and be surrogate and\nHelp out and really kind of tell his story and how we met down here and now we're investing in other markets up there and\nI tell you a J. B. David Durham\nHad a phenomenal presentation and not only walking around Detroit we were staying downtown walking the streets at ten thirty at night from a restaurant that we went out to the night before the event and\nI went into Detroit with a bad attitude and walked away completely changed they've got a lot of metrics that look really good up there\nAnd I think they are probably a pretty well poised to to have some great things going on we have members as as you said that found the show or most of them came down to Dallas and so it was the closest place to fly into or drive two and a did their their\nStudies they invested a some deals there and now they're doing deals in and around Detroit Michigan a\nBorder to go to places we're gonna take a break right there's got to come back

this was this was stunning but not necessarily surprising about the rapid expansion of wiccan and witchcraft in the United states\nIt is truly incredible well its nature of horrors a vacuum I don't know who said that was a sir Isaac Newton I don't know I don't know who set up but it's true nature apple horrors a vacuum you can't have em truly empty space\nWithout something rushing in to fill it and when the leftist because they hate God because you can't deal with their own then hey got hey Jesus said the Bible hate everything they want to have been very successful and driving Christian influence\nInto the underground almost in this country starting with Madeline Marie O'Hare back in the early sixties\nWell if that creates a vacuum something's going to fill up\nThe secularists are fine was secular humanism manners all there is an all there needs to be the end without man uh nothing can be accomplished in because there's man exists all things are possible while that course all of that as a bunch of hooey piled high in deep otherwise known as a PHD however\nOther things are filling that void beyond secular humanism\nAnd the witchcraft explosion in this country is just that based on surveys done by a particular college in Connecticut called trinity college which has been studying this for some time and tracking it all the way back to Nineteen nineties twenty eight years ago they started they\nSaid that in Nineteen Ninety they had determined that there were approximately eight thousand practicing wiccan Z\nOr witchcraft in the United states eight thousand in two thousand and eight\nEighteen years later ten years ago there were three hundred and forty thousand\nAre you going to hold of this and Eighteen years the number of practicing which is in the United states has gone from eight thousand to treat three hundred and forty thousand the estimate today using these rates\nAre progression in their algorithms that all they how they calculate this weather others the stuff that these guys do the determined that there are now approximately one hundred and fifty four I'm Sorry one point five\nMillion a practicing which is in the United states now it's less than one percent and I will tell you this if they vote they all vote Democrat that's a fact I'm not being snooty snotty or city here which is a vote Democrat\nBecause of value is which is they're very much into child sacrifice which is abortion they're very much into moral perversion which is Saddam and all the things the Democrats seem to be entirely enamored with because\nThey can't deal with their own sense so they have to force their failed philosophy on other unsuspecting generations also known as schoolchildren\nSo the rejection of Christianity is left to avoid and people\nSays here and there's a star story wicker has effectively been repackaged for millennial consumption now witchcraft doesn't focus so much on the pagan is Dixie panic in the demonic it now it's starting to promote areas are free thought understanding\nOf earth and nature\nBut she'll get\nWhich is a vote\nDemocrat because of value is which is there are very much into child sacrifice which is abortion they're very much into moral perversion which is Saddam and all the things the Democrats seem to be entirely enamored with because\nThey can't deal with their own sense so they have to voice their failed philosophy on other unsuspecting generations also known as schoolchildren\nSo the rejection of Christianity is left to avoid and people\nSays here and there's a star story Wicca has effectively been repackaged for millennial consumption now witchcraft doesn't focus so much on the pagan is stick said panic and the demonic\nIt now it's starting to promote areas are free thought understanding of earth and nature\nBut you'll get end quote but you'll get down to the basics the or worship of loose suffer when it's all said and done continuing the quote here is the sad thing is that millennials who are exploring the dark side of the supernatural seemed to have more faith and belief in most Christians\nThey're open their spiritually hungry and the spirit realm in this particular case the dark spiritual realm responds\nThe biggest hindrance to understanding the realities of spirit realm is on belief they set wealth ... believe it they actually embrace it stronger than a lot of Christians this is what's interesting the number of which is and I commented on this\nA few weeks ago how the wiccan the which is now have their own or the room and worship area in the basement of the chapel\nThe chapel yet that the Christian chapel at the air force academy in Colorado Springs and why are they in the basement well two reasons first of all on your way up from hell would not the basement be the first room you'd come to\nA number to the basement is the foundation scripture says if the foundation be destroyed what can the rights as do that's where the enemy goes is after that but there are more\nThere are now more which is in the United states than there are in the Presbyterian Church usa that's right the peace usa the largest Presbyterian denomination has ... has fewer people in it than there are which is\nBut maybe there's overlapping membership who knows [laughter] [noise]\nA one other quick thing and then we're going to get onto ... record thing's great things were going to get out onto our issues of the Democrats and the violence and the importance of this election\nAnd this is a study that now shows that the majority of people who call themselves ... records you can call yourself anything you know what\nI could call myself Chinese and it doesn't make me Chinese a guy who call myself whatever I caught myself super intelligent but that doesn't make me super intelligent we all know that\nA majority of suppose ... Christian now believe that God except for worship\nOf all religions all religions it doesn't matter that you're wiccan apparently\nIt's just our youth sincere in your wiccan belief that is important sincerity is trumping correctness\nFolks is was horribly dangerous and all I can say is if that's the way these supposed Evans overlook all Christians believe they are Christians and they certainly aren't ...\nI could call myself Chinese and it doesn't make me Chinese a guy who call myself whatever I call myself a super intelligent but that doesn't make me super intelligent we all know that a majority of suppose Evan jello crushed Christians now believe that God except\nFor worship of all religions all religions\nIt doesn't matter that you're wiccan apparently\nIt's just argue sincere in your wiccan belief that is important sincerity is trumping correctness\nFocus was horribly dangerous\nAnd all I can say is if that's the way these supposed Evansville are Christians believe they are Christians and they certainly aren't having jello jiggle\nOr man I hey you know and by their fruit right one last item here before we break loose and go heavy on democratic violence and the consequences of what it means to you and\nOf a transition piece from what happened at the hearings to what we apparently can expect in the future\nQuote\nThe hysterics so the past few weeks has indeed not whether and well on America's so called the feminine ... who demonstrated once again that they allow feelings to rule over rational thought and logic\nAnd their attempt to run nominee Brett Kavanaugh out of dodge by protesting his confirmation hearings their antics have shown just how ridiculous\nNonsensical emperor posh preposterous they are [noise] are ironically they're using female hysteria\nTo get away with anarchy\nI got a repeat that this is just so true and so concise they're using female hysteria to get away with anarchy today we refer to these hysterical barking had eggs keep in mind these are not my words and these are words coming from a woman writing this\nToday we refer to these barking hysterical barking hangs as men haters\nAre radical feminists are college professors these hysterical heartbeat didn't call a press conference to challenge decisions no\nThey threw themselves at the doors to the hearing room sobbing and clogging up the doors they collapsed in the hallways of the capital and they had to be dragged away they dressed as handmade inflamed Kavanaugh will enforce a dystopian uh\nSo concise they're using female hysteria to get away with anarchy today we refer to these hysterical barking bags keep in mind these are not my words and these are words coming from a woman writing this\nToday we refer to these barking hysterical barking hangs as man haters are radical feminists are college professors\nThese hysterical heartbeat didn't call a press conference to challenge decisions no they threw themselves at the doors to the hearing room sobbing and clawing up the doors they collapsed\nIn the hallways of the capital and they had to be dragged away they dressed as handmade inflamed Kavanaugh will enforce a dystopian America where women have no rights and are forced to have children for the ruling class I got to stop your second\nThese are the left us who are only complaining of whining ... about\nA ruling class that doesn't exist so that they could become the ruling class which actually does exist back to the quote\nThe ambush senators in elevators cornering them aggressively simultaneously screaming and crying and the thing the women cry about toxic masculinity I'll share a bus seat any day with a man's brought her over a shrieking barking heartbeat\n[laughter]\nThis is a mile behavior cannot be allowed\nThis is not peaceful assembly much of the behavior of these violent or over rocked Krohn is dangerous one level of antics lead other groups\nOf nasty orders to upped the ante and try something even more hysterical an even more dangerous than they're misguided attempt\nAt achieving total anarchy\n\nIran's just stop here a second I'm going to continue for a minute\nYou need to get the speech this is this is so well stated\nContinue perhaps it is a good thing that these women are paid protesters because what they are hysterical demonstrations they also demonstrated that they are unemployable for one employer would hire even one of these toxic nasty women\nWhen they don't get their way or they feel put down or insulted you can bet they'd turn their entire company on end with threats of civil rights violations and legal action\nThese women are not serious civil libertarians they are rich in his shoes seeking to tear down institutions their anarchists seeking power and control a country that reviled them\n\nEvery feminists are not paying under this call I got to repeat myself these are not my words this was written by a woman back to the quote and I'm going to end with this every feminist I've ever met has had an abortion\nThey've led teen and college years full of promiscuity alcohol and drugs they're mostly white they're mostly middle to upper class mostly educated unspoiled they rebelled against decent parents\nAnd the boredom of living in normal virtuous\nLife and quote Katie\nThat was just over the top those so good\nAnd control a country that reviled them\nEvery

antifa the smile that the primarily white\nSpoiled little Darryl acts that call themselves and teeth are Occupy Wall street sometimes\nAugmented by black lives matter\nI'm Sorry you know what their ... but not much that sort of a separate thing but the worst of the violence should the violence as far as the just routine\nOr a vandalism and torturing of buildings fire bombing spray painting taking clubs to a and things to beat people up with wherever somebody is speaking that they don't like is largely a leftist spoiled white contingent\nAdjust is\nThere though there are the children of

can we do some ideas strategies I'm going to basically summing up by saying you need to be diversified but not diversified stocks bonds cash but diversified among different strategies\nOn the investment side as you grow money for retirement or just regular investing and then especially as you look to take income and retirement\nIf you look at all the thinking out there and all the ideas people have different ways to approach this you know you look at um different articles TV shows all the radio shows\nYou know they're always asking you know I Wonder what's the best strategy was the best strategy to use or maybe somebody's promoting certain strategies you know sometimes that maybe a base\nSeven three one seven seven six zero\nSo you look at okay so what can we do some ideas strategies I'm going to basically summing up by saying you need to be diverse of pie but not diversified stocks bonds cash but diversified among different strategies\nOn the investment side as you grow money for retirement or just regular investing and especially as you look to take any income and retirement\nIf you look in all the thinking out there and all the ideas people have different ways to approach this you know you look at um different articles TV shows other radio shows\nYou know they're always asking you know I Wonder what's the best strategy was the best strategy to use or maybe somebody's promoting certain strategies\nYou know sometimes that maybe are based on experience maybe sometime in the bake based on a lack of experience\nBut one thing is you look at different ideas of how to make this work and let me share some ... was shall we did some ideas basically you have ideas dealing with a me I could break it down maybe into three categories and then some are summarize it up in a different way you have some of those who\nSay that you should be following fundamentals you know basically looking at economic data then you have somebody of people talking about technical ideas maybe looking at price movement so you know the price of the stock and moving certain ways we should buy or sell it\nThen you also have what they called the quantitative deserve their clients are looking at a statistic some probability when if you know there's you know no no systems are really going to be right and all marketing environments you know again every strategy is going to work until it doesn't\nMaybe it's better to look at maybe a diversification among the different type of strategies but also tiny and risk management\nSo instead of using what they call like a light switch strategies or strength standalone strategies\nYou know which maybe help maybe limit you may be helping one time but maybe don't help and one other times maybe we can look at an approach that looks at a combination or you know a a a a allocation among the different strategies but always\nTying in risk management so what happens if you did fall one strategy it's possible that the trigger may go off and you may not be invested you know or you may be fully invested\nAnd so but it may not be the ... and its move you know the trigger may be get out of the market but maybe instead of getting getting out of a hundred percent maybe there's some alternative way to look at this\nSo what do you do well maybe you look at what they call you know looking at your core and your diverse in and\nLike your satellite for meaning you're basically your basic ideas your basic approaches trying to build a portfolio based on this for\nA poor you know poor poor strategies are the basic strategy and then you can make sense some small amounts of the satellite strategies you know there may be outside maybe some active by an active\nUh NASDAQ a market timing idea alternative investment ideas like that but always\nTime in a risk management factor why because we want to grow the money and we also want to minimize the down terms\nYou know even the tiny amount to fix side you know the fixed income the bond side that's been taken not too good of a hit this year right you know interest rates creeping up Federal Reserve raising interest rates and I'm a bond values going down but there are still some fixed income strategies\nBuild a portfolio based on this for a poor you know poor poor strategies are the basic strategy and then you can make sense some small amounts of the satellite strategies you know there are maybe outside maybe some act of bon active\nUh NASDAQ a market timing idea alternative investment ideas like that but always time in a risk management factor why because we want to grow the money and we also want to minimize the down terms\nYou know even the tiny amount of fix side you know the fixed income the bond side that's been taken not too good of a hit this year right you know interest rates creeping up Federal Reserve raising interest rates\nAnd I'm a bond values going down but there are still some fixed income strategies that have still over time done that have done perform well and actually this year are performing not too bad you know right now interest rates are basically almost doubled\nWhere they were a year or so ago\nAnd the index that track you know like short term bond and bond index as they're all negative for the year\nBut if you look at some strategies using like short duration income or floating rate income\nMaybe some more stable type of a values there are actually using good returns right now and they're basically either break even are positive for the year you know have raised in a it takes advantage of rising interest rates\nAre looks to not have like a long duration so they're not can clobbered by\nA price moments you know on bond so but again you know everybody's different you know again we want to plan before you invest in the sharing with you some idea on the investment side because of what we're what we saw last week and the thought process of what's going to happen going forward\nAnd never predict you know investments in the investment or more of a market you know somebody said they can predict what's going to happen\nAnd you know that's good for them but history has shown that you know it's very hard to predict and a lot of productions do not come true it's always easy to say everything everything's going to go bad because eventually something does turned bad\nBut uh you don't want to be sitting on the sidelines 'cause you're still want to grow their money but you want to protect and in case\nAnd that again come into play as one of the risk factors involved in retirement planning dealing with the sequence of returns you know what return or you're going to get before he retired and what you're going to get return wise on your money or investments right after you retire\nIn a couple that with taking money out in retirement how's that going to affect you know so you know you look at you know go back to two thousand seven two thousand they somebody just retired that started taking money

I'm not saying that's going to happen again but that's a very good return yeah that's a good period of time right ... over twelve point seven five percent on average during the Twenty years but there were five years when there were negative returns\nOne was only a negative three and negative four or five negative seven more with the negative uh fourteen point six of another with a negative twenty six point five\nDuring the first two years what happens if you have her investments when she starts taking money out of retirement if she experienced a decline I'm In the best memorial so let's say that I'm sixty five year old with two million dollars is going to planned needs a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to live on\nIt's going to take that out of their retirement accounts at a good high percentage to take out or you know maybe more than four percent obviously but um let's say you're going to take that and if I'm required minimum distributions ... show end up taking that amount in the future\nSo what happens over time if you do the numbers and you know it's hard to see on the radio but I got in front of me here but I Try to communicate that to you\nIf you've experienced those returns that I talked about from Nineteen Seventy two I'm from Nineteen Seventy three and nice to Nineteen Ninety to\nCheck out the two million dollars took out a hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nEnds up getting over three million dollars obviously three million dollars in income and has about eight hundred and fifty nine thousand five hundred dollars left after Twenty years not too bad right got a lot of an income three million still as a almost two million left\nYou know and hopefully that will survive if she lived another ten or Fifteen Years or so\nBut when I was if you look at a different approach with a look at a different approach instead of this taking out the hundred and fifty thousand dollars or the investment account\nEvery year we didn't give you as an alternative strategy a different place to grab that money that wasn't subject to the stock market wasn't stuck subject dancers rates wasn't such ... subject to inflation and if you had health care you'd still issues you have health care is still get that income\nWeapons if those down years those five down years instead of taking out from your accounts that this person took it out from the alternative side\nAnd took money from from uh the uh different investments whether it's still money invested in some type of a ... income uh generating type of uh a program through the annuities [noise] you know they'll guarantee back by claims paying ability of the insurance company that offers the annuity\nOr even through a life insurance plan maybe you know built up money on life insurance and able to take money out of structural properly tax free\nWell in this example this person had saved additional money inside of life insurance policy ends up taking out the money\nTo inflation and if you had healthcare you'd still issues you have health care is still get that income\nWhat happens if those down years those five down years instead of taking out from your accounts that this person took it out from the alternative side\nAnd took money from from it they are different investments whether it's still money invested in some type of a ... income uh generating type of a program through the annuities [noise] you know they'll guarantee backed by claims paying the ability of the insurance company that offers ...\nOr even through life insurance plan maybe you know built up money on life insurance and able to take money out of structure properly tax free\nWell in this example this person had saved additional money inside of life insurance policy ends up taking out the money in ... in those negative years not from her investment but from our insurance policy but because it's tax free doesn't have to take out a hundred and fifty thousand\nOnly has to take a lot from that the net out what she would have taken after taxes ends up after those Twenty years ended up getting more a little bit more than three million dollars of income\nBecause there wasn't as a you know wasn't taxes on it\nBut ended up with a balance in the existing two million dollar IRA with over five million dollars because she didn't experience those negative returns for five years or five years and whether I'm withdrawing that money for those five years\nAgain it's everybody's different as of may be a stretch example but there's something to get you thinking that perhaps\nThere's another way to look at the planning process and look at the numbers of how to protect what you have saved still generate that income and then have that income not subject that much to the stock market fluctuations not subject to much to answer stray\nMovements whatever the Federal Reserve that are not subject to inflation because you'll be able to give yourself a raise overtime\nRight and then you know looking at 'em or if there was a health care issue there that income will still can continue to come into the house\nIdeas some different ideas that I'm here to help you with maybe explore give me a call reach me through
