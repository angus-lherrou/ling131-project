there\nAll right we can get your calls if you want to hear me talk about it\nWell let's begin in this segment by playing some rational sound\nHere is representative Louie Gohmert\nOn the migrant invasion and clip number one on the Savage Nation\nThe president made no bones about it and uh uh actually you can take his lead from the Democrats and Democrat name Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite president summit and I mean sixteen after Bon Jovi as gangs came across\nThe border in New Mexico and Galen bunch of people are not only the name for at Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border\nBut ... you're on pushing into Mexico now President Trump's I'm going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and then they should be stopped\nNow we hear the president himself talking about who's funding this clip to on the Savage Nation\nAnd now we're starting to find out and I won't say a hundred percent I put a little tiny question mark at the end but a lot of money spent passing through people\nTo come up and try and get to the border\nBecause they think that's a negative for a number one they're being stopped\nRegardless that's our issue\nOkay they're being stopped well how\nPresident Trump we're behind you on this make no mistake about it\nWe back you on this end by the way most Democrats back you want us to get the leadership they don't back anything except anything that's stabbed us in the back how are you going to stop them well\nThis is from an earlier speech a week ago but listen to number three and see what he said last week\nYou know I'm willing to send the military to defend our southern border if that's just a car because that illegal immigration onslaught\nThe Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge or to change the laws they like it they also figure everybody coming is going to vote Democrat you know\nThey're not so stupid when you think about it right\nBut they are crazy in the crazy Democrat\nRefused to support any form\nOf border security legislation defect our\nAbsolutely horrible all fashion loophole ridden immigration laws\nOkay good

military why\nWell I'm retired police as Dr Savage I'm really concerned about putting ... because are they going to arm the military which they said the ... really think there would be a national incident I mean they're numb\nOh no you're a thousand percent right because the the Hondurans Guatemalans in all Salvadorans will provoke an incident to get shot they won gunfire into the crowd\nThey should hire more border patrol and specifically place them on the border instead of you know driving around and stuff but I really think that\nWell I think that it's I think once they get to the

Monday evening you know one of the most common questions I get\nBy email and by taxed and all from friends and from listeners to this program is\nIs there anybody out there we can believe when they start making predictions about how the elections are going to go two weeks from now and the answer I usually get them is no most of the\nSmartest folks out there were terribly wrong two years ago about the sixteen election and I'm not sure there are much better now Peter Rob joins me now who's a Newsweek contributing editor and Peter do you think that all the protections of the big blue wave are going to come true for the Democrats in two weeks\nA G G took about a no pressure introduction [laughter] a good movie as ours um no I don't I'm\nOn unless unless there is some kind of ... spike in turn out that exist only on the Democratic side or there's some kind of\n... I hate the phrase October surprise but some kind of defining moment that throws the president into huge distribute like\nLeeks ... reportedly from inside the Mueller investigation or some kind of arm confrontation that leads to a massacre\nOr with the caravan of folks who are walking towards America from Honduras I think this election largely into a push\nTo another was neither side gained a lot or loses a lot even on the house side\nEven on the ... even in the U.S house I I I I think that um some very interesting numbers out there if you if you break them down and they you know the national generic ballot interesting it shows the Democrats have\nJust on average about an eight and a half point lead right now right according to remember that in Nineteen Ninety four um they had a three point lead on election day and they lost control the house for the first time in four years in the fifties sweets uh fifty feet swaying\nUm there's a little bit more defined polling ABC had a poll out last week but looked at the sixty seats where their ratings um the wedding toss up or leans that they're not that they're not put away\nA lot even on the house side\nEven on the ... even in the U.S house I I I I think that um some very interesting numbers out there if you if you break them down and they you know the national generic ballot interesting it shows the Democrats have\nJust on average about an eight and a half point lead right now right to important to remember that in Nineteen Ninety four um they had a three point lead on election day and they lost control the house for the first time in four years in the fifties sweets and fifty feet swaying\nUm there's a little bit more defined polling ABC had a poll out last week that looked at the sixty seats where their ratings um the reading them toss up or leans that they're not that they're not put away and in those in in in that the the the generic ballot was margin of error\nI don't I just wanted to my book and it's led by one point when you see these other metrics Peter\nLike the president's ah favorability rating is about where Obama's was\nAt this point in Obama's president so you know I Know we had a Sater economy back then but that's part of what plays into whether people have a positive impression on\nTrump's numbers among black voters are almost unbelievable I mean to go from eight percent and election day in sixteen two twenty three percent almost triple and then to go to thirty six percent now and that's usually a group of voters that the Democrats practically own lock stock and barrel\nThat's right and it it's interesting in terms of perspective I think Trump because there's a poll out today um I it may be Rasmussen um\nThat shows that Obama the that Trump's popularity is actually a little bit higher than Obama's was at this point going into the midterms but if you if you think back and remember the coverage in that in that in that first two years\nObama was regarded as a wildly popular president who had a who had a hard core conservative\nUm dislike for him but that that he was popular\nUm the media today looks at the same numbers and say well Trump is unpopular and that's because Trump is unpopular with the people who are looking at the numbers not because it's the way the country feels about him and and and this is part of that part of the problem with with with\nThe election forecasting hum is when you um you know what the what the metrics you use help determine the results and if you put garbage and you're gonna get garbage out\nThe other thing and and I keep reminding people have this if you took any single subject\nAnd had the entire national news media spend two years telling you how bad acts was at the end of two years you'd have Americans thinking just about as low in opinion of whatever axe was as possible and they've done that to Trump's rise\nAs you point out they've done they did the polar opposite with with Obama they had tangles up the leg and they they thought he walked on water\nAnd they they they believed all those things about him and they said\nAnd how how dare you other nationally known radio talk show how come out and say you want Obama to fail\nI wanted a hell of an American that is yeah\nAnd and how long that was\nUm and now I'm ... ... people actively jumping down in cheerleading for Trump to sail and ... that's the sense it's divisive America it's wonderful it's it's terrific it's phenomenal um so perception has a lot to do with it but I I think right now the balance of power\nUm that that the people who are really going to determine which way this election is going to go our ship bourbon let's call them establishment Republicans are\nThey did the polar opposite with with Obama they had ten goes up the leg and they they thought he walked on water and they they they believed all those things about him and they said\nAnd how how dare you other nationally known radio talk show how come out and say you want Obama to fail\nOr I Want her to hell in American that is\nYeah and and how long that was\nUm and now I'm ... people after ... jumping down in cheerleading for Trump to fail and ... that's the sense it's the voice of America it's wonderful it's it's terrific it's phenomenal um so perception has a lot to do with it but I I think right now the balance of power\nUm that that the people who are really going to determine which way this election is going to go our ship bourbon let's call them establishment Republicans are Bush Republicans they're not necessarily driven by issues they're not necessarily driven by one particular thing um\nBut they sort of look at look at look at the whole universe of things and they've always been Republicans and they didn't like the Trump tweets and they didn't like the way he behaved\nIn the campaign and the way that he talked to Jeb Bush in the way that he talked to John ... in their ... yeah the Access Hollywood tape make some kind of uncomfortable um\nAnd so they may have been turned off to the Republicans but then they saw what the Democrats did to Brett Kavanaugh\nMostly I Wonder if that have happened all his one of them was that\nPlanned as the early October surprise that we're supposed to dismantle\nThe president and everybody behind him and now the caravan is the second October surprise do they have time in the next to a fourteen Thirteen Days ah sorry fourteen days to be able to make a difference with another surprise that dropped so late in the game that there isn't any practical ability to respond to it\nWell it it ... there's always that possibility again this is why I feel for example fear for example something like a leak coming from what his report it to be the mother investigation\nThat says that after the election then after the deadlines I have ... the statutory deadlines to pass the president is going to be indicted\nA recommendation will be made to indict him for bank fraud or um indicted him for corrupt foreign practices or nothing to do with Russia collusion nothing to do with anything that we've already covered that that that\nThe people are tired of hearing it back but something new something sexy um you'll you'll recall how everybody was protecting it was the ... it was the end of end of days and and the crack of doom for Trump when they gave him unity to the fellow who's been a long time\nUm CFO the Trump Organization yeah um the the explosion with which the New York times um dissected Fred trumps stolen tax returns which also has apparently turned out to be nothing\nUh and and I wouldn't be surprised if there were some kind of last minute I'm Sunday afternoon a explosive release on the Internet\nSome scandalous story a that's a temp is it's an attempt to a discredit the president\nAnd drive down Republican turnout is that that's really what a lot of these negative stories are about and what a lot of this continuous negative um poll analysis is about it's about voter suppression it's about telling the Republicans\nYou're going to lose don't feel bad be ashamed don't show up don't ...\nI'm Talking to Peter Ron from Newsweek Peter I got to wrap it up but I got to tell you some of the things though that the left seems to think of as slams on Trump I listen to a discussion about a week ago of this giant piece of New York times that\nKind of last but at a um Sunday afternoon a explosive release on the Internet\n... scandal is story or the attempt it it's an attempt to a discredit the president\nAnd drive down Republican turnout is it that's really what a lot of these negative stories are about and what a lot of this continuous negative um whole analysis is about it's about voter suppression it's about telling the Republicans\nYou're going to lose ... feel bad be ashamed do show up doped up\nI'm Talking to Peter out from Newsweek Peter I got to wrap it up but I got to tell you some of the things though that the left seems to think of as slams on Trump I listen to a discussion about a week ago of this giant piece of New York times did on all the efforts by Trump's father\nAnd they've decided this is the only thing they've got left hatred for Trump hatred for what he's doing which most Americans look at and say well it's working out pretty good for me\nWhy do you hate this and they've decided well okay that's why you get things like this vox is reporting tonight the numbers are in in Trump is up so despite all the negative publicity at the last two years and especially the last two months\nA Rasmussen poll shows the President Trump is more popular at this point is president the then President Obama was and at times the difference is almost ten percent\nThe poll released by the wall Street Journal and NBC News shows that Trump's approval is the highest it's been since he was elected and I'll remind you\nHe's more popular than Obama was at the time Obama got nothing but great press the first two two years he was in office frankly he got it most of the eight years that it was in office\nBut the first two years were almost it was this slobbering love affair\nBetween the mainstream fake stream press and Brock Obama meanwhile Trump got exactly the opposite every reporter with a TV camera or a microphone or an Internet Web page was telling you all the reasons you should hate Donald Trump\nSo with all that he is now beating Obama by as much as ten points it's extraordinary let's go to Diane Diane you've heard us talk about and talking about that invasion caravan is headed north that I Know is going to reach our border before election day what's your take on\nIt now I realize longtime listener first time caller stank concerns and Derek I'm very concerned about the old days when\nI'd never heard anybody talk about this is a huge difference in state that's kind of based on the table and yeah who is feeding\nStream fake stream press and Brock Obama meanwhile Trump got exactly the opposite every reporter with a TV camera or a microphone or an Internet Web page was telling you all the reasons you should have Donald Trump\nSo with all that he is now beating Obama by as much as ten points it's extraordinary let's go to Diane Diane you've heard us talk about talking about that invasion caravan is headed north that I Know is going to reach our border before election day what's your take on it\nNow and I live a long time listener first time caller Oh thank you can and I'm very concerned about the old days when than that I've never heard anybody talk about\nThis is a human just stole that kind of based on the table yeah who is feeding her clothing and what about sanitation and they say\nWhat about all I Know I've heard on the TV for oh well you know the Mexicans are handled a lot of stuff like that and you\nKnow it doesn't at ten thousand people\nDying I earlier this hour you and I are thinking on the same lines 'cause earlier this hour I was asking out loud as I began the hour\nWho is doing all that if you assume let's say it's less expensive because it's Mexico and you're not eating and some tourist place let's suppose you could feed seven thousand adults on five dollars a day\nA day not a meal say you could feed 'em on five dollars that's thirty five thousand dollars a day somebody is put that money up somewhere\nAnd my guess is the people in the caravan don't have that kind of money they've also said that they're going to be moving them by buses now\nWill seven thousand people at Seventy people per buzz is a hundred buses a hundred drivers a hundred diesel supplies to be able to move Seventy buses or or or a hundred buses north was Seventy people each individual ten thousand minutes a hundred buses\nI mean that's that's a substantial bill no matter where you go\nAny label

seem to come up with every time there is a major election in America and take just a moment to cast a vote my Twitter poll\nHere's a question and ... and it's based on the fact that the New York times is reporting the Trump Administration is considering defining gender now if you're thinking to yourself well Lars I already know a gender is you're either a boy or you're a girl\nAnd if you're born a boy than you stay a boy if you're born a girl you stay a girl you can change your outward appearance you can change your clothing you could even go to a surgeon or if you want to and make some physical changes in your body\nBut the chromosomes that make up whether you're male or female they stayed the same no matter what your DNA\nStays the same unless you're Elizabeth Warren in which case you can look as hard then as far as you can to see if you can find some Native American blood in your background you know that's that\nShe created her own problem with that so this is the way the New York times but to the Trump Administration considering narrowly defining gender as a biological condition determined by ... at the genitalia birth the most drastic move yet\nAmerican more fighters go

of the law on Lars Larson show well the top news stories seems to change a fairly frequent bases in the news these days and\nOver the last week or so the biggest story has been a massive caravan of people I call it the invasion caravan that is headed toward America's southern border they are still a a little under two thousand miles away\nBut they seem to be making pretty good speed at this point they've already busted through the wall of the barricades\nTo get out of Guatemala to get into Mexico and now I'm actually goes apparently just law allowing this massive caravan their head north towards the United states a lot of talk about that with Maria Aspen knows who's the national director of the remembrance project Maria welcome back to the program\nHello and thanks so much for having me on again\nSo is this the October surprise that the Democrats usually a plan for every every election every major election Erica\n[noise] right they orchestrated and then they try to place blame on President Trump's shoulders and you know trying to make him look like that and ... percent of the Republican Party as a even when I was trying to do is to protect our boy\nYeah and in fact the president said if he needs to put the military on the border do you think that's what we're up against because this caravan started at one thousand it's now supposed to be at seven thousand or greater ... their numbers that are greater than that not now\nBy the time it hits the border if he keeps growing the way it has been it could be over ten thousand people trying to get into the United states all of the same time\nI think the ... the only way that we're going to stop this invasion and according to a chief\nManny ... added the Archie the sector gave me a grand valley sector and he cannot catch him a cow and he mentioned that the last two weeks there were four hundred family unit coming through\nLook like the uh an evil person and the Republican Party as the evil when we're trying to do is protect our borders\nAnd in fact the president said if he needs to put the military on the border you think that's what we're up against because this ... started at one thousand it's supposed to be at seven thousand or greater ... there are numbers that are greater than that no no\nBy the time it hits the border if it keeps growing the way it has been it could be over ten thousand people trying to get into the United states all of the same time\nI think the military is the only way that we're going to stop this invasion and according to a chief\nMany ... out of the Archie the sector the Rio Grande valley sector and and uh Texas him a cow and he mentioned in the last two weeks there were fifty four hundred family units coming through\nAnd this and is in advance of that care of and you know also you know they captured a gang members cartels and of course there were over seven hundred pounds of marijuana and other drugs from I think it's it's overwhelming for the ice ... for the border patrol agents um\nThere has to be some help there and that's what he's asking for reinforcement\nI thought we might actually get some help from Mexico when President Trump last week said he said to Mexico if you don't help us stop this then we may end up with no trade deal whatsoever and I thought a mutually Mexico was trying to help but now I guess not\nRight and just think of it this way um I think that that Mexico of course is helping the Democrat Party and should\nUm the Democrats win this mid term they would of course move again to impeach President Trump and they would implement their far left agenda so this is a win situation for Mexico and and you know like a large that they have no intention in stopping this invasion\nNo and in fact I didn't get Trump out of the way and if they can take away one house of Congress many they stop him from passing anything as a bill which pushes them back to the only other thing you know the ...\nIs executive orders and I've been very proud that this president has not used executive orders in place of legislation the way his predecessor did so frequently\nWhat else can we do to get those things don't [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell I think that the making people need to speak up and they certainly need to be showing their support and making their voices heard calling the White House it to zero to\nFour five six eleven eleven and telling President Trump that we support him and we support placing the military on the border in order to stop the invasion and protect America and American lives and also\nI think that we need to go ahead and some odd to see go vote\nAnd vote for those who will stand for securing the border and for an America First agenda that President Trump is pushing forward that he can't do it alone you know we can send the use of military we can\nTake that trade deal off the table and you can you know we can also um implement some sort of um I Would say\nAdditional fees or assess fees wherever possible like that we met and sees you know Mexico has assessed fees for the money going into their country from the United states you know let's take it back on that and really\nMake them feel the pain because every man's fees I bet that\nGardeners the Mexico and Mexico just about two billion dollars a month on those remittances that is why the from the money wired into Mexico\nYou know they have every intention again to continue that flow of money and to push their citizens um onto the American taxpayer\nYou know we can send the use of military we can take that trade deal off

just about two billion dollars a month on those remittances that is why the from the money wired into Mexico\nYou know they have every intention again to continue that flow of money and to push their citizens um onto the American taxpayer while trying to collect the U.S foreign aid and U.S foreign aid has to be taken off the table as well er\nHey Murray or would you remind reminding my audience about them remember and project and what that is all about ...\nWhat led to we started in two thousand nine as a voice for victims killed by illegal aliens and naturally Lars November fourth of this year for going to recognize the national day of remembrance for Americans killed by illegal aliens\nAnd this is our seventh year to recognize his national day probably want to make sure that this issue is not swept under the rug once again and you know President Trump have also asked him to officially a nationally proclaimed this\n... remembrance so that we can fix the problem you know these families are American families are permanently separated from their loved ones never to see them again\nTill they reach heaven all one hundred percent preventable and it's the lack of a spine and courage and doing the right thing that these politicians who are elected to do that and protect America\n... and follow our constitution and that's the reason why there are ... are wonderful falling Americans who have lost their lives\nSo you know we we do we also Lars have a chaplain seat group and a crisis intervention group where we help the families and get the help that they need\nMe psychologically emotionally to sell you know we're doing a lot of things which is so very grateful that President Trump has the Exxon with on this issue and listen to a moms and dads but you know we have to get off the cells I think it offensive family to help out and speak out\nYou know the only ideas I dad do yours I liked the idea of taxing the remittances but I think there may be an easier way to do it uh you know that the IRS has all kinds of rules even for American citizens if you go down to your bank for some reason and deposit around ten thousand dollars the IRS gets notified because they know that\nThey don't want to be hiding cash\nCyber feeling a lot of the remittance money that it sent back is money that's earned is cash by illegal aliens who are working illegally in this country and when they send it out of the country by going down to a convenience store a place where they can buy Western Union money order and send it to their families that effectively hides it\nFor tax purposes and I have a feeling a lot of it was was because they've not pay taxes on it so say if you're a legal American citizen or a green card holder you have a Social Security number if you want to send money by Western Union\nSay more than a hundred dollars a at a time you're gonna have to show Social Security number if you don't you have to pay a fee\nAnd you could make the feet produced up you could make it five or ten percent\nAnd say this is a way of reminding folks ah that that you are not going to be able to dodge the tax\nAdding cash I have a feeling a lot of the remittance money that is sent back is money that's earned is cash by illegal aliens who are working illegally in this country and when they send it out of the country by going down to a convenience store a place where they can buy Western Union money order and send it to their families it effectively hides it\nFor tax purposes and I have a feeling a lot of it was was has they've not pay taxes on

gonna have to show the Social Security number if you don't you have to pay a fee\nAnd you could make the feet pretty step you could make it five or ten percent\nAnd said this is a way of reminding folks ah that that you are not going to be able to dodge the tax man\nAnd that we understand that if you're saying that money south or we can stop you from sending the money but we could say you have to have Social Security number or it's a five\nOr ten percent the the other thing I Would suggest to Americans as we're heading into the fall where it gets cold in most parts of America a lot of people decided to take vacation time and sometimes the vacation to Mexico both because you know there's a lot of sun\nAnd millions of those people by the way we're paying the individual mandate penalty tax\nBecause they couldn't afford coverage until Republicans repeal that tax of course Democrats would like to put\nIt back in place but it's not good enough to get rid of the penalty to get rid of the individual mandate\nIf you don't also have deregulation and there's nothing for people to choose their no non Obamacare options available even if Obamacare's voluntary rather than mandatory unless you also have\nThe deregulation a deregulatory steps that we've seen from the Trump Administration and Democrats are basically saying look if we can't mandate Obamacare let's ban all the other option so people have no other choice then they're stuck in it and I think that's a you know if our guys were any good\nAt talking about health care on the stump they would be carrying Democrats up on that things are horrible vote from them and they somehow said we're protecting preexisting condition or provisions\nWhich makes no sense because this you know they're basically voted to repeal a guaranteed renew ability in the short term market well you know if you get sick and develop a preexisting condition\nGuaranteed renew ability is a great protections you don't have to go into Obamacare and yet that's exactly what they voted to repeal so if anything it was the opposite of what they kind of made their talking points on this vote in the media basically let them get away with it to the extent they paid attention at all\nKnow fill over the weekend I heard more people document pre existing conditions ... I I Want to I Want you to test my numbers on this and see if this works I Wish we could knock this issue out altogether once and for all and here's how I Do it\nOptions that people have no other choice then they're stuck in it and I think that's you know if our guys were any good\nAt talking about health care on the stump they would be carrying Democrats up on that thing so horrible vote from them and they somehow said we're protecting preexisting condition or a provision\nWhich makes no sense because this you know they're basically voted to repeal a guaranteed renew ability and the short term market well you know if you get sick and develop a preexisting condition guaranteed renew ability to great protections you don't have to go into Obamacare and yet that's exactly what they voted to repeal so if anything it was the opposite of what they kind of\nMade their talking points on this vote in the media basically let them get away with it except they paid attention at all\nYou know fill over the weekend I heard more people document a pre existing conditions ... I I Want to I Want you to test my numbers on this and see if this works I Wish we could knock this issue out altogether once and for all and here's how I Do it I've talked to a few different experts including Betsy McCoy and you and others who know this issue well\nAnd they say you know for all the talk about pre existing conditions the total number of people who\nMeet that description is about four hundred thousand and they base that on the number of people who signed up with Obamacare for pre existing conditions and the number of people who are in risk pools before Obamacare came along it's four hundred thousand people out of three hundred and thirty million people in this country\nAnd the total cost of covering those people it's a high premium it averages thirty two thousand dollars a year\nBut in terms of a national policy is twelve billion dollars is a drop in the bucket in a federal budget that is four thousand billion dollars and you need twelve dollars twelve billion dollars to cover it if we passed a law that said if you\nAre you know judge to have a pre existing condition and it's not it's one that actually takes a lot of money to cover then we're just going to cover you\nWere just period unless you you know make more than five hundred thousand all those years I mean you could set some income limits on and you knock that issue out altogether and say now let's solve the rest of the problem let's let the private sector do most of it and the only other big issue I'm aware of\nIs the one where people say but if you're going along happy and healthy\nAnd some things strikes you down you need a above a triple quadruple bypass or you need a liver transplant or something like that say fine let's so catastrophic plans let's not have the government do it let's have the private sector of the government were to say to the private sector insurance folks hey can you come up with a product that's what they called the insurance industry my wife\nUsed to work for half like a long time ago um have a product that will cover you for catastrophes right it's a kind of coverage most people have if they paid off their cars just one policy that covers you only if\nThings go completely terribly wrong and those can be sold very cheaply to\nNow you've covered people for catastrophic laws you've covered all the people the four hundred thousand that are that have pre existing conditions now the rest of it for the most part is the stuff where people wanted Obamacare to pay for maintenance basically they wanted you to pay for everything from birth control pills\nTo your annual checkup and everything else which I don't think should be the subject of insurance\nAny more than I think my car insurance should cover the maintenance on my car\nNow my wrong on the numbers and I'm getting this wrong\nBut I I Would I Would disagree only with your last point at the end there because Obamacare actually in practice has extremely high deductible\nWe are all paying these very high premium so we're not going to cover Dinah that routine stuff or even a more expensive stuff than that and so you know the the perverse\nEffect here is that we've got a centrally high deductible plans but we are paying a fortune in premiums for them anyway and then there's no other there's no other choices available because of the regulatory structure I'm Betsy is number four hundred thousand might be right I think that\nIt's probably a little on the high end because the first four years after Obamacare passed before the exchanges launched there was something called the preexisting\nFor everything from birth control pills your annual checkup and everything else which I don't think should be the subject of insurance any more than I think my car insurance should cover the maintenance on my car now my wrong on the numbers and I'm getting this wrong\nBut I I Would I Would disagree only with your last point at the end there because Obamacare actually in practice has extremely high deductible\nWe are all paying these very high premium so we're not going to cover tiny that routine stuff or even a more expensive stuff than that and so you know the the

the regulatory structure I'm Betsy is number four hundred thousand might be right I think that\nIt's probably a little on the high end because the first four years after Obamacare passed before the exchanges launched there was something called\nThe preexisting condition insurance plan\nWhich massively subsidized people with preexisting conditions so they could get coverage if they were uh you know uninsured of all because the exchanges that launched yet and they the total\nEnrollment and that was about a hundred and twenty nine thousand now a lot of money thrown out of money prematurely say maybe they were twice or three times as many people that wanted to go and what if that if it hadn't run out of money but\nI think if anything has the highest amount from that the\nShow so maybe it's a couple of hundred thousand it's the kind of thing that a very affluent\nCountry a wealthy country like ours could easily say\nIf you're one of those people were there could be a catastrophic metal medical condition her condition that goes on for a long time to breathe existing condition caused a huge amount of money to cover we could cover it and we could say that's something we ought to do as a society unless you're already getting it through your work will be glad to cover it\nAnd that would take that one right off the table filled thank you very much we always appreciate your

President Trump shot thought it'd be great to date\nTo have even less strong because there's just two preachers talking to date which you're probably going to hear some things that you don't get paid to talk about Jonathan great to have you with us as a male show let's talk a little bit about\nWhat what do you address on the program\nWhat you are open what's in the beginning you know everybody's gonna see life through a lens when you see life through the lens of Bible prophecy that\nThere's an anti Christ system that wants to one world government\nThen it takes all the personality out who to vote for Hillary or Trump\nWho's had an affair who you like better\nYou understand that you know if you don't have the Bible then you'd say what so wrong about the border being collapsed but when you see in the Bible that it's not going to bring about peace it's going to bring about the seven the worst seven years planet earth ... known then it takes all the personality is out of it and you see what's going on right now even at our southern border\nIt's not a bunch of people that want to make it to America it's contrived\nAttempt to collapse the last sovereign nation on earth to bring about a one world government and that's why it's worth fighting for when America falls or if if you let America fall all of civilization collapses with it and it brings about the one world government that the Bible says we're supposed to actively resists\nSharp and you can see the leaders calling for it you see that Israel from France and Italy and lead up to Germany and ... to the pope even calling for open borders right that it's not Christian now one of the contention things in America has been the fact that well how could people even vote for Donald Trump\nSo talk a little bit about that\nWell you know there will always try to play on the on the holiness thing to get Christians to vote one way or no or not vote away so they bring up the fares Donald Trump said how can any Christian which is what type of my program how can any Christian support Donald Trump\nSo they'll bring up look he's had affairs he uses foul language well number one the election was in between Jesus Christ and Donald Trump\nIt was Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump [laughter] and so any any fault you find with him you can find with her\nBut like I said when you take the personality out of it and the Bible not only talks about the anti Christ with a capital lay it says there's many anti Christ was a smaller but anybody that's going for the objection ... or the objective of a one world government and one world money system the Bible says and revelations Thirteen that's the anti Christ system but\nHe ordered every man both great and small slave in free to receive a mark in their right hander in their forehead and no man could buy or sell without that mark when you see people pushing for that objective I don't\nHow can any Christian which is what type of my program how can any Christian support Donald Trump\nSo they'll bring up look he's had affairs he uses foul language well number one the election was in between Jesus Christ and Donald Trump\nIt was Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump [laughter] and so any any fault you find with him you can find with her but like I said when you take the personality out of it and the Bible not only talks about the anti Christ with a capital lay it says there's many anti Christ with a smaller but anybody that's going for the objection\n... or the objective of a one world government and one world money system\nThe Bible says and revelations Thirteen that the anti Christ system but he ordered every man both great and small slave in free to receive a mark in their right hander in their forehead and no man could buy or sell without that mark when you see people pushing for that objective I don't care\nIf they have been married for fifty years and go to church every every day they are of an anti Christ spirit because the spirit of God like I heard you teach before they got actually likes nations got lakes God didn't Institute one world government he loves nations and variety and so all the conflict you see right now is over that\nRepublicans say like with Brecht should wait the British people voted to exit the EU\nThere like a middle son Todd around the neck where they can't even fish their own waters that can only have ten percent of the fishing correct and there's a Norwegian thrown off\nCatching older British fish and Belgium is just shouting where you can't grow strawberries or whatever and basically they actually in prison and have no clue\nShut now you see the marching band the breakfast and all that kinda stuff because that'll push by the globe the Syngenta because they want to destroy the nation states\nThat's right and it ended demonic and that's what you see any time a group of people are a person tries to flow in the opposite direction of that all hell breaks loose you literally couldn't do anything you want on air if it's supporting a one world government and the liberal agenda that's actually demonic\nBut then if you do anything moving the other way like they did on the show everybody moves against it because it's it's not the media that's behind it or the aluminum ... it's the devil\nBits in back of a one world agenda but that's what we're called the do the easy things to lay down and say well what do you take a lot of heat for doing that but the Bible says actually that anti Christ spirit can't accomplish what it wants\nUntil he gets in the way is removed and the he's the church so it's not optional if you're a Christian to stay quiet we are anointed to resist and destroyed that spirit and God has an interest in seeing that destroyed\nSo God's not up in heaven saying I Wish people want to be so political from the pulpit God is looking for people like Dr some or all doing all all the guys from before why American never Cape preachers used to stand up and address that stuff because they understood it's not politics it's the devil looking to Institute an anti Christ government and God doesn't want it done\nWhich the same thing came again strangers that ... show the anti Christ is Andy cries Andy preaching the gospel you come preach about the crush you\nCan't preach about repentance you can't preach about the blood you can't preach about the virgin birth you can preach about the resurrection that's what it is being shed that's right\nThose things when you preach them change people's hearts\nAnd if people get enough for the seat of the word of God in which is what happened in American the last election America still had enough of God and the people\nThat they smelled a rat with Hillary Clinton and even people that couldn't specifically put their finger on it just new there's something about her that I remember hearing about in church when I was five years old [laughter] that that that's not right sure and so that's why it's in ...\nWant it done which the same thing came again stranger that's right so the anti Christ is anti Christ and the preaching the gospel you come preach about the cross\nCan't preach about repentance you can preach about the blood you can't preach about the virgin birth you can't bring about the resurrection that's what it is being said that's right\nBecause those things when you preach them change people's hearts\nAnd if people get enough of the seat of the word of God in which is what happened in American the last election America still had enough of God and the people\nThat they smelled a rat what's Hillary Clinton and even people that couldn't specifically put their finger on it just new there's something about her that I remember hearing about in church when I was five years old [laughter] that that's not right sure and so that's why it's important for ministers to speak because\nGod when you get the word of God in your heart it automatically puts a resistance\nThese elected officials worked for us we don't work for them that's right we don't ... them\nThey're not super stars and they're not royalty they been put in to office to do that one of the people that just as a government all the people by the people and for the people in the ... every person to hold it re elected official accountable\nSo you need to pick up the phone you need to call your congressman and US Senate and you need to tell them\nNo no no we are not tolerating stop the train you know President Trump was elected because one of the great lines of that election was build the wall\nAnd something that was very interesting right before the ... election I had three Hispanic pastors in my office\nSo I didn't want to broach the subject to them hey what do you think about President Trump you know so I [laughter] I just because I didn't know where they stood to politically or whatever ... said to them they're all from the central South Florida region I should have been shown what do you think about the upcoming\nElection and in in the Spanish English they said to me\nBuild the wall\nAnd burst out laughing but I understood because some of the ... come from ... some of the ... come from Nicaragua some of them come from some of the other countries that have had the problem so they've seen all of that\nThey've seen all of that right so it it's a very imperative to Florida is a very important election coming up in two weeks' time because we have either the communist\nMayor of Tallahassee oh you mean to me and was it\nOr Iran disadvantage show people are going to and I apparently I haven't really I don't know much about the mayor but apparently he wants to make Florida ... state like California\n... chai should've middle from the ... from

it\nNo politician was can scripted to serve\nThey asked for the opportunity [noise]\nShow there is a a former Republican congressman\nIt's perfectly fine\nTo confront\nElected officials in public\nI responded to him this morning\nAnd my response went like this\nConfronting an elected official\nWho's having dinner with his wife in a restaurant\nIs not confronting them in public\nIt's called harassment\nIt's trespassing\nAnd it should get you arrested\nWhere are you on this\nThis is an important issue\nBecause we've got people on both sides\nAdvocating resistance\nAdvocating getting in the faces of elected officials administration officials or members of the media\n[noise] we've got acts of violence right now primarily on the left\nDo you agree with this former Republican congressman\nThat it's perfectly OK\nTo confront\nElected officials in public\nThree one two six for two fifty six hundred again my issue is this and it's really two fold\nIn public fine\nYour elected official right\nIf I were still a congressman\nAnd I'm walking down the sidewalk\nOr in the middle of a town in my district\nAny buddies got a right\nTo confront me\nTo ask me a question\nTo get

in my district\nAny buddies got a right\nTo confront me\nTo ask me a question\nTo get something off their chest\nIf any constituent is any American sees me seas or seized an elected official in public they have a right\nAbsolutely they do to petition their government they got a right to say hey Jeff Flake or I think it's wrong that you supported Kevin uh\nThey have a right to do that in public\nBut eating dinner in a restaurant\nLike Mitch McConnell was this weekend when he got harassed eating dinner with his wife\nNow that's different that's a public if you're an elected official and you're sitting in a restaurant eating dinner with your wife ten people come into that are ... that that restaurant to confront you\nThat's not my definition of public\nThat's cross the line you're not in public anymore you've crossed into a private space\nPeople in that restaurant this weekend were harassing Mitch McConnell\nWould say you on this\nThree one two six for two fifty six hundred one other point I've got is the whole definition of confronting\nI mean when I was in Congress I was very public member of Congress\nPeople coming up to me all the time I held town halls all the time people could get in my face people could poke me in the chest people could say whatever they wanted to say to me that's fine\nBut what do you mean by confronting\nYou mean getting physical with an elected official pushing an elected official\nPutting your hands on an elected official\nYou don't have a right to do that\nI I think what we forget a lot is these elected officials yeah they got to answer to us and if they sign up to run right they got to put up with the heat and they got to put up with the American people we put them there they got to put up with us when they're in public getting in their face\nBut there are Americans as well and they've got rights and you don't have a right to push them you don't it if you see Mitch McConnell walking down the street you don't have a right to

with us today yes we pulled out of your products so whatever you'd like to talk about would be great so why don't we start off with um how you got involved with life seasons and a little bit of background of life seasons itself you\nOr I had been with why isn't the couple of years I have actually been in the natural product industry for um a little over twenty five years now and so I sort of look at my time in the industry as a combination I'm to be here at life seasons in you know as we talk about some of the things that we're doing and\nTo be used as energy for all of these things as we were talking earlier about hot as hyper ... senior high blood sugar how does that how does that deal with we're trying to move that blood sugar includes blood glucose to the south to be used as energy so All right\nSure you guys do a lot of these products by themselves or reading resigned themselves individually\nYou know one of the things that we love about why seasons and this was probably my one of my favorite things about the line Jennifer and periods is that this is a line that what we've done is we've taken you know we can programs to gather for people you guys do that on a daily basis\n... at some point it becomes price prohibitive for people um and so to pull all of these foreign to pull all these ingredients off of your self build this for a new ad out and\nAll it will probably be about Seventy or eighty dollar formula however you know someone's paying the thirty dollars for it\nWhat we're trying to do is really get that person is a a something that will actually move the needle for them and helps her in their life\nSo it's very important would love to see people come in and get some sort of results quite quickly just by adding supplementation a pick to their their health regimen and a\nVoice or body really knew that they may see something really fast so uh I think uh this is the type of product is we need to have for our customers what you think Jennifer\nOh yeah really ... I I really like how you do with the top five ingredients on all of their products so on and and like you said if you're border line and you know a tight to um\nMaybe about a Seventy or eighty dollar formula however you know someone's paying the thirty dollars for it because what we're trying to do is really get that person is a a something that will actually move the needle for them and helps your in their life so\nIt's very important I Would love to see people come in and get some sort of result quite quickly just by adding supplementation a pick to their their health regimen and a\nBoy or body really knew that they may see something really fast so uh I think uh this type of product is we need to have for our customers what you think Jennifer\nOh yeah really good ... I I really like how they you do with the top five ingredients on all of their products\nSo on and and like you said if you're border line and you know a tight to um you can change you can reverse that you know and I think it's going to be very cost effective because I'd rather take a pill [laughter] than taking a shot or a needle into for the insulin\nSky high now oh my God it's like for them was type one it's really a shame to see that happen but you know that's just the way the medical system is right now and that's why we're flourish inherit healthy habits because we have people like you healthcare professional enemy and bar but so many other great people working here Chris we have a fantastic staff\nAnd so the type of education will help us\nGive our customers the correct choice and we want to give them a choice we don't tell them what they need we always give them a choice they need to make that decision so can you tell us more about your findings radios on grew close stability\nOr we have 'em out to la poets acid which is a um antioxidants both fat I'm an water soluble instead of just improved insulin sensitivity um a few of the ingredients that we have um\nAre interesting in that we know that if someone has high blood sugar levels or let's say if if I had high blood sugar levels then one of the things that there are symptoms\nConsequences of having that some of those as we know like for instance um it affects like a lot of circulation it affects potentially I help and so what we've done is we've come back with several\nIngredients that help support that so we have Dilbert right bill Barry is a a a cousin of a blueberry and so that\nUm basically that's been traditionally used for I help individual acuity so support they in health okay and so that's something that if we're dealing with sugar I'm In excess of sugars then I I help is one of those things that when you take care\nOf it also which is a broom and build a coal both of those herbs are used to support circulation in support vein help so they help the\n... just the the vein helps they integrity in so again if we're dealing with blood sugar issues then it's it is it's a thing potentially it's affecting circulation okay probably another in and go ahead go ahead Jennifer that was like\nYo know omelets I must say I'm just agreeing with the with the circulation it's so important like you said\nI was in those lego extremities yeah\nYou know it is than at any time someone is looking at a ... if if we are syndrome accident central Mac is actually it's\nPretty much pre pre diabetes but you have diabetes pre diabetes and then syndrome acts okay and so that's what we're doing a research on I'm In a at St George's medical school um with this triple barn steady and glucose stability in so syndrome act is actually um it's it's it's\nSeveral things that have been packaged together I'm In ...\nThen it's it is it's a theme potentially it's affecting circulation K probably another in and go ahead go ahead Jennifer that was like\nYo know unless unless I'm just agreeing with the with the circulation is so important like heat sides obviously knows leg goes extremities yeah\nYou know it is and I anytime someone is looking at a ... if if we are syndrome accident syndrome act has actually get it\nPretty much pre pre diabetes but you have died many pre diabetes and then syndrome is okay and so that's what we're doing a research on 'em and ah at St George's medical school um with this triple barn steady um glucose stability in so syndrome act is actually um it's it's\nSeveral things that have been packaged together um\nAnd so for instance it's a weight gain around the midsection um it's also like high blood pressure high triglycerides high cholesterol levels and so those indications have been put a pool into what's called syndrome acts and so those are identifiers\nFor pre diabetes hate her and then you know and then pre diabetes as we know um that\nYou know one step before type two diabetes in so that's one of those things that there is we also have that in um an urban here it's called ... Greek and fenugreek has been used in it's been used and they didn't seem to Greek times in the new Greek is actually a fiber in what it does is it slows the absorption\nOf glucose and so by slowing the rate of absorption of glucose it actually helps the body um it helps with the glycemic index and so it helps to balance our bodies not getting this Russia sugar so any Greek so unique ingredient in here as well\nAll right Chris we had a caller and we always like to discuss how people may use this product on a daily basis and put it into their regimen and they need to follow the programs that are provided on the a panel of the bottles\nBut this let's take a three capsules a daily with or without food or would you split those three up or take all three at once uh what can you tell us they're so our listeners will know how to use this product correctly for their advantage or getting toward better health\nAnd that's a great question I think that's always the question right when we look at supplement fact panels and the bottles of how has the optimal way to take this so if someone is investing in this product I Would encourage them to break that up and say you're taking it I Would take personally am ticket won three times\nA day and probably before or right with the meal and so one of the things that you get there is is that for instance on a in a normal meal you know we have carbohydrates sugars and so what it does is it helps to um it helps to work with it in that format so\nUm so I Would say take at one time today I'm with your meal\nOkay and you mentioned investment they made an investment to buy this product they're making an investment to change their health so I Want everyone to really keep that in mind that a health doesn't come without a cause\nBut the thing is we have all these fantastic products from life seasons right here at the store and come in and see all these are great formulas they put together also for more information\nWWW dot life seasons dot com life seasons dot com\nAnd Chris I tell you what a this is a very very important area because so many people come in and their fifties and they're always teetering to type two diabetes this will give us a product that go to because now we know a lot more about it and we will have some answers\nFor our customers now and they may choose what they would like uh\nOne three times a day or with your meal\nOkay and and you mentioned the investment they made an investment to buy this product they're making an investment to change their health so I Want everyone to really keep that in mind that a health doesn't come without a cause\nBut the thing is we have all these fantastic products from life seasons right here at the store and come in and see all these are great formulas they put together also for more information\nWWW dot life seasons dot com life seasons dot com\nAnd Chris I tell you what a this is a very very important area because so many people come in and their fifties and they're always tutoring to type two diabetes this will give us a product to go to because now we know a lot more about it and uh we will have some answers\nFor our customers now and they may choose what they would like a so Chris I'm\nAnother quick run a that seems to be you know energy metabolism or we have ... metabolism by life seasons for weight control can you briefly touched on that products and how it may go hand in hand with blue close civility\nSure those do go hand in hand right and so the metabolism formula it has a several different um uh nutrients in it right or our ingredients one of them is green tea\nUm green tea has an active plant chemical called eat\nA ... G CGI okay and that helps with what's called thermo genesis creating an internal body the beautiful thing about the caffeine content which is minimal right compared to like the coffee or just the caffeine extract is that it's in a hole form and also to\nEl ... and caffeine or no one to one ratio in a naturally occurring green tea in so\nHealthy any help sees a smooth out the waves which are the smooth brainwaves\nAnd so has that um and also to have a\n... and ... and cocoa was known as a food at the gods and so yes those two things together that help for mental\nThat helps mental acuity it also helps like from a Thurmond Jenike approached without really over stimulating the central nervous system\nOn it has green coffee bean green coffee beans that was you know it's um it was very very popular several years ago but the green coffee beans it's interesting\nBecause what that that little bit like if indeed Greek is what you're talking about Cindy Greek um slows the glucose metabolism in the intestines well the green coffee beans that basically um get in hip it's the absorption of of sugars then you'd have to them and so that's how that works\nSo we also put me in in this product because chromium such an important thing for blood sugar level\nSo both of these products they could be used by themselves they can be used to gather I'm at that would make a great program for someone and you know what periods you were talking about\nAn investment well you know the other thing for us to remember is we're all looking for we're all looking for a return on investment right in whether that whether that's our lifestyle and lifestyle changes um the food we eat\nTogether I mean that would make a great program for someone and you know what areas you were talking about\nAnd that meant well you know the other thing for us to remember is we're all looking or\nUm I used to take a product that was um I won't mention the name of the product because I'm not trying to talk you know negatively about any product but I was spending about fifty dollars a month on this product and it was the best one I could find but it slowed me down a little bit\nUm just mentally and you know not made me feel fatigue but I'm just a little too relaxed at times so when I saw that this actually increased um energy or or decrease fatigue I ordered samples of that raw material right away um\nBut the studies didn't stop there and actually showed a boost in mental cognition helps with a sleeplessness I'm just a really multifunctional ingredient\nAnd the the studies were correct I mean this I can take it first thing in the day I have energy all day um and it helps you sleep better at night it's just an amazing starting point for this formula I'm\nNow in a single kept so it has the the clinical dosage the stronger dose um and then we wrap to really comprehensive formula around that\nUm we contacted Dr Michael Smith who uh was with us and um helped in building this formula unwrapping the formula around central um we started with a ... magnesium\nHum it carries a shows Andrew Barry rodeo law gab or um cold lean in off the tall and then a full B. complex\nWe're using the better source be vitamins of course the\nA P five pie for these six than methyl full late I'm an ethical bottom and\nYes it's all break slumped in this kind of person just once a like a you know feeling stressed in one day or do I have to continually take it and how fast when I see the results\nYeah it definitely is a formula you can feel the first time you take it um but I Want to say that with a little disclaimer everyone is different and the way their body assimilate ingredients is different the studies that showed all the results that I spoke of on central was done over sixty days\nUm but most people that take a you know a healthy dose be vitamins feel the energy and sometimes things either relief just from that so\nThere are ingredients that can work very quickly and then there's also wants to build up in your system over time so what most people notice when they stay on the formula is that over time it actually works better and better\nOkay so this is the type of product it from day one you should take every day and continue to take it every day\nLike you know than feeling stressed in one day or two I have to continually take it and how fast when I see the results\nYeah it definitely is a formula you can feel the first time you take it um but I Want to say that with a little disclaimer everyone is different and the way their body assimilate ingredients is different the studies that showed all the results that I spoke out on central was done over sixty days\nUm but most people that take a you know a healthy dose of B vitamins feel the energy and sometimes things either relief just from that\nSo there are ingredients that can work very quickly and then there's also the ones that build up in your system over time so what most people notice when they stay on the formula is that over time it actually works better and better\nOkay so this is the type of product it from day one you should take every day and continue to take it every day what is you know you're going to be in a very stressful situation would have benefits you to take to for that stretch a stressful situation that you may be in\nThat that can still be an option with the stronger formula um the reason we increase the sun thrill is so that you don't have to on those higher stress days and most of our customers that were taken two packets at a time um have found that they get the same amount of stress and anxiety relief from just the one pill\nUm but you can still take that higher dose as long as you're not doing it on a daily basis on a daily basis um that extra amount of the vitamins specifically the beat twelve\nCould actually cause uh the adrenal system to be over work and it'll have an opposite effect on your energy level\nOh awesome good to know and you're ... or vitamins are the top of the shelves metric about um a a mess of ... and tell you right this is what we liked about your products because you use the best ingredients of possible especially with the sense of ... and ah when our\nCustomers read the label it's going to say something real\nAnd so you're going to know that that's often forgotten to write off it's not even on the label but you know because that is quite the trade name and quite the uh high tone a product that you put in here as a ingredients so that's awesome or anything else you'd like to say about why stress before we go on to another great product\nUm I'd like to say that it's healthy habits you guys definitely have an awesome discount program um the normal F. R. P. on that month supply of pills is thirty nine Ninety five and I think he said it was in the twenties right Terry\nYes yeah what the check writes them because\nUh you know we do take discounts on everything from em is our duty but uh\nThe because of the new product will have to make sure that we've got a price correctly and double check that out so thanks for that heads up\nA you know we were talking a little bit about the vitamins and wide threats but one of your go through products and one of your flagship product that everyone over fifty probably should be using and that's the twelve strips\nJust the simple strip two thousand M.

having you on the show today Thanks so much for having me neither\nOne of the morning and welcome for me it was a lot of things we can talk about this morning but I'm the sort of was talking to a basic question about medications you feel over the counter medications are useful or dangerous for patients to take on their own so we're talking to me you're with your [laughter]\nI mean I'm Talking to basically ... eighty one percent or more uh people take over the counter medicine for minor aches and pains fevers\nUm all kinds of things they can be really helpful they can save you a visit to your doctor they can help you take your health and your own hands\nOn they kind of break down the barrier between the patient and the doctor but they can also be dangerous if taken inappropriately so that's what we're gonna talk about today because there are they are real medication then there's real dangerous if you take it inappropriately\nHappy hour specials daily to seven and other incredible shrinking teach freshman to read a sports real strict force recon bell nor Scott ... sports bar in Nineteen Ninety\nWhen we are talking with Dr Aimee shot gamble board certified medical doctor in internal medicine and allergy immunology and before\nThe break I asked her what are the three over the counter medications you see patients making mistakes with especially this time of year\nThis time of year and there's so many preparations that we're taking a we already talked about the pain medication kind of over the counter and an anti inflammatory that's often over used or misused abused\nAnd one is sleep aid I think we all know someone or ourselves that been taking 'em an over the rebate I had maybe for long periods of time\nNor Scott's words for gene\nWe are talking with Dr Aimee shot double board certified medical doctor in internal medicine and allergy immunology and before\nThe break I asked her what are the three over the counter medications you see patients making mistakes with especially this time of year\nThis time of year and there's so many preparations that we're taking a we already talked about the pain medications kind of over the counter and an anti inflammatory that's often over used or misused abused\nOn the second one is sleeping aids I think we all know um someone or ourselves that's been taking 'em an over the counter sleep aid and maybe for long periods of time or and higher doses of those are um wants to watch out for ... and the third one you might not be aware up as much but it is dire Reddick so water pills on\nOften are the ones that are misused or overuse\nI'm asked about so those are three classes that we see very often and ones that you should watch out for\nThose years of sleeping aids number two does that also includes things like a ... a herbal thing like you know tone and things of that nature\nYeah so melatonin his great alternative to the over the counter like you know that we have ... here and we have um you know just say Walgreens brand I'm a sleep at so much one is actually a very good alternative um natural alternative however\nThat does seeing that it's often available over the counter it's quite high I'm here I have like a five milligram tablets when I work with people I tell them to start with one milligram ...\nSo um that's kind of the issue there with um these kind of over the counter sleeping so cannot higher dosage of melatonin be toxic\nSo potentially you know we don't think that it'll get toxic to the levels um the danger yes levels until it would be way over thirty five milligrams around do\n'em it's but we don't think that it's good for you melatonin is like a hormone you know in your body a you really don't want to be pushing it a at such high level so I'd say\nMost people get pretty good relief with just one milk one milligram\nSo your your over counter drugs in the pharmacy was also the over ... that is true yeah who's most at risk of overdosing and overturn Redmond medications\nThe people that are at most risk is white you know you would imagine the elderly mhm um children\nAnd people who are also taking other prescription medications so like we used the example of pain or you know relief there's ... anti inflammatory they might be taking through their doctor they might be using ... to counter ones um and so and also people with kidney disease I'm\nA diabetes in the last straw a coma ... um you know with the sleep age you have to worry about ... um people having a large prostate chronic lung disease I'm all of those groups of people for many many groups of people need to worry about it\nSo you know just kind of a combination question you're elderly in terms of being at risk good kind of yeah or really where the pain medications that piece of white elderly white elderly because they don't want to go to the doctors they just want to show there are so old now and so ... for sure that they do they know better\nIf my mother [laughter] that along with the fact that they may have heart disease they may have high blood pressure high cholesterol your diabetes stomach ulcers already and then on top of that they're taking something that might cause stomach ulcers\nI'm a diabetes in the last straw glaucoma I'm you know with the sleep age you have to worry about ... um people having a large prostate chronic lung disease or all of those groups of people so many many groups of people need to worry about it\nSo you know it's kind of a combination question here you mentioned the elderly in terms of being at risk of a kind of yeah or really where for pain medications that piece of why elderly why elderly because they don't want to go to the doctors they just want to show there are so old now and so experience for sure that they figure they know better\nIf my mother [laughter] that along with the fact that they may have heart disease they may have high blood pressure high cholesterol\nYour diabetes stomach ulcers already and then on top of that they're taking something that might cause stomach ulcers right so that's also the other risk is that they're taking they have pre existing conditions and they have pre existing medications and like you said they might be\nI'm not reading that back um\nYou know and just making it as what they think might\nBe rain really needs them them over the counter the payments when you do it comes right down to it\nYou know minor aches and pains um you know you hate your knee wild golfing you um you know caught in a little\nUm a while you were hiking you foul or whatever it is it may be something that can be helpful for a short period of time but if you're not getting relief and its ongoing for a week two weeks three weeks that's basically a time that you need to take care\nSo my question that comes up than those who you are but misuse sharing so much ... to take a short conversation thus far the when it comes to pain misery over the counter\nThat you can still get dependent upon them started misusing them to higher and higher doses and then find yourself in the compounding effect like oh so the eight hundred milligrams I'd be brokers are doing it however good ... might help\nYeah um you know they're not typically addicting per se like the pain medications that we think about a quarter a narcotics that will be a but people have pain they can use them every day I mean you know young people are using high\nHigh dose and ibuprofen almost regularly going on and so it's definitely there's definitely a potential\nSo what's your son is at the IMF and the impact on your organs like the kidney outside of things that you can't game yesterday or yes\nIt's it's because it's impacting it's impacting your got lining it's impacting your kidney the Tylenol it's impacting your liver ... so there's a lot of um concern you can overdose on all of those\nRight how does your nose isn't on the list of questions out or something like an over overdosed overuse of some like ibuprofen impact your gut lining because we've been hearing a lot about this whole yeah because yeah oh yeah\nThat and so there's an act yeah al ... as you know you know acid reflux um ulcers got lining issues has become larger and larger issue um sometimes people blame our diet and a lot of people actually bowling I'm the overuse of our medications\nFor example slowly you may have been taking ibuprofen as a young athlete and then you take it as an older person\nAnd you're really breaking down that lining of um ibuprofen actually break it down and when you take it in high doses for long periods of time you especially it's susceptible people so you know one person a can take time to be fine\nPerson be is already susceptible to acid reflux ... then you give him a ton of ibuprofen and that just push them over the edge for an author\nSo when you're involved with something like that like ibuprofen and I'm a research for example is a is a as ibuprofen for example something like that the kind of a drug that once you do to stop using it\nAll served got lining issue has become larger and larger issue um sometimes people blame our diet and a lot of people actually ... um the overuse of our medications\nFor example slowly you may have been taking ibuprofen as a young athlete and then you take it as an older person and you're really breaking down that lining of um ibuprofen actually break it down\nAnd when you take it in high doses for long periods of time you especially it's susceptible people so you know one person a can take ... even be fine but person be is already susceptible to acid reflux ... then you give them a ton of ibuprofen and that just pushed him over the edge for an author\nSo when you're involved with something like that like ibuprofen and I'm a ... for example is it is a as ibuprofen for example something like that the kind of a drug that once you do stop using that things can return back to normal or is it a permanent damage that occurs\nWell if you get to the point where it's an ulcer no you have to get that you know it won't necessarily fix itself um if it's mine are heartburn off and when to stop using it you'll just symptoms will go away so it really depends on the level of damage that it did [noise]\nYou know my dad was a um if one works [laughter] yes several yeah\nThat was good yeah it's\nInteresting to me because he you know he would do

I I basically say hey it's overwhelming\nOr is it is contaminated because they did random testing on many many many different sources of tap water and they found particles a plastic in them and I think they said thirty one uh types of beer\nAnd um and they all looked at a [laughter]\nFor the heroes [laughter] it's like you can't win a because it's like you try to have maybe a a metal water bottle or you try not to shoot up your mood I Know you know laugh while you know then\nUm you can't you know you think about it okay you have a paper cup from the coffee shop but has a plastic lining inside what about that\nHitting that hot liquid right or just like ingesting right so um there's a lot more to be explored and you know the\n... I I basically say hey it's overwhelming yeah you just want to do your exposure not necessarily get rid of it I'm completely I think it was very hard for her to do you know yes did you know that I'm store with states that we get have\nA valley on number two the plastic particle that has been shown to be really bad for our hormones [laughter]\nSo much rather have you\nTo do [laughter] you know\nIt's everything actually [laughter] I mean everything is an easy things like that like I just don't ask for the receipt if it yeah restore true yeah [laughter]\nUnbelievable all my no ... I Know we've talked with as you mentioned we talked with his briefly before and the difference between active in in the act of greed is especially what is the difference where there's other we're we're going through this\nOkay so did you know that most medication say ... for example it's Ninety percent inactive it's binder that talk it's color it's delivered its stabilizers okay ten percent of it is the actual calcium carbonate the\nActive portion and so I think it's something that we don't pay attention to we think oh these pink shoot you know sugary pills like they must be all I'm helping me but it actually only ten percent [laughter] my\nMy goal and the thing is the you know as you look at the active in in ... piece of your thinking so yeah I'm a little emotional the questions you'll go to them so to ... what are you saying that they'd be better if it was just little sliver of a pill to give you their was active\nWell I think the problem before was they didn't know how to stabilize these medications they can't just put the active ingredient in ... they were using cheap stabilizers\n'em and sailors and flavors to make it tastes good and they never thought that somebody would take this um every day for months and years right and so that's why you do now are looking at an active ingredients and I'm saying oh look at this nighttime sleep aid it had active ingredient in a better job but then it has\nA sort of a tall and it has a blue number one and read number forty\nAnd it has on the farm of ink\nI'm Guy and so that's why you know I like to enact a I like whole foods because they really monitor the vitamin supplements that come into their store um and I don't know express ads well at whole foods I Know for a fact of whole foods\nHas very strict no do you think she I'm Sorry to interrupt you rented it don't you [laughter]\nDo you think that the younger generations are really becoming a lot more educated than the older generation have banned that just kind of took the word for you know this is what the doctor prescribed it says what they've said I should be taking I really think 'cause I Know\nMy girls I they\nAre always questioning everything and our our mental butter is a nurse ... you know they really get into the nitty gritty even way more than I Do but I Try not you know to\nHe's a guy and so that's why you know I like ...

the same talking points Hitler and the national Trump on the national\nSo two things and I'm going to come back to that\nI think there's a difference between nationalism and patriotism\nBy respecting the law the republic that makes one a bit of a nationalist\nThere's nothing wrong with with a moderate form of nationalism\nThere never has been\nUm and like I said there's a difference between patriotism and nationalism\nAnd ... also when you are in a populist era\nNationalism which seems to increase in terms of identification and in in in terms of appeal\nThis and\nYou can yes and you can't have ... you can be both patriotic and you can\nEnjoy a modern form of nationalism\nI mean there's I don't think that there's anything wrong with that\nHere's where\nHere's where they get\nIt gets weird ah\nAnd there was a good piece of a friend of mine wrote\nUh was discussing this at at at National Review discussing how certain strains of conservatism\nMight not fully identify with nationalism\nOr libertarianism because libertarians they see as they write some the borders of barriers to free markets\nAre religious conservatism often emphasizes the God given dignity of all people which transcends national borders\nUh and then they say there are many conservatives are their American conservatives of different kinds which\nHad been influenced by you know there was a

that's the name so now do socialist front you Democrat socialist out there who are still mad because you say well turned cities national extending Hitler studies nationals okay do do socialist now\nAnd see how that works real\nTo us so they were socialist go ahead let's say Hitler said right isn't that what you believe isn't that the the party to what you pledged\nAren't those the policies you support because you naive Leon stupidly\nBelieve that the one reason they just haven't worked in the past is because of rights people\nDidn't implement them and I'm sure those people at the time thought the reason that their form of government hasn't worked in the path of because of the right people weren't there to implement them and the people before them thought that the one reason that

some distant relatives that are lifelong liberal activists and donors and operatives\nI think that they I think that that is the ... thing that I have ever heard\nThese people doing this and so it looks like these are just it looks like these are some politically minded um\nA distant relatives of his to our petty and they they want to\nThey just they they want to lash out at them and they think that by trading on his name\nThat they can get attention I Can't stand that I have always found it supremely disgusting\nWhen people who are desperate\nFor media attention they trade on the shaky familial relationships for petty political jab\nI hated it when I thought was God's family I hated it from my own personal experience\nI hated also with seeing this was lax all family\nPeople who pet politic bending over relationships with other human breeding humans I think they contribute to our rot in this country\nYou know I I feel I've the word fail to describe the fury I feel when they see people who do do the\nIt is it's it's sad to me like doctors family\nThey his siblings then you could tell they were just militia\nThey were they were progressive because only that sort of ideology\nIs going to compel someone\nOnly a progressive ideology is going to compel that person to be so nasty to their family member\nI just can't stand I mean like for instance my mom's side of the family are all big time\n[noise] people who pet politic bending over relationships with other human breeding humans I think they contribute to a rotten this country\nYou know I I feel I have the word fail to describe the fury I feel when I see people who didn't do the\nIt is it's it's sad to me like doctors family\nThey his siblings then you could tell they were just militia\nThey were they were progressive because only that sort of ideology\nIs going to compel someone\nOnly a progressive ideology is going to compel that person to be so nasty to their family member\nI just can't stand I mean like for instance my mom's side of the family are all big time progressive\nI it it yeah I mean it's\nSo I like I said I speak from personal experience people who want to trade on your family name or your your people who want to trade on association with you because they know that they're going to be seen as influential in the press or they will be seen as well I Know even though even if you haven't talked to him for years\nEven if they wouldn't know your kids if they fell over um\nYou know and their own back yard\nThat's what I hate when I see stuff like that is what is wrong with people that they would do this\nBut this is a progressive ideology the progressive ideology will turn family member against\nIf you don't go along with it\nThey'll ostracize you\nI've seen that just you know personally I've had family members totally ostracized me because of it\nJust one particular family segment but you know or if somebody in the media asks them something\nEven if they haven't seen every years and they don't even know when my kids was like\nThey'll they'll be sure to give a negative word\nSee I mean the thing is it would be so easy because I have family who are in politics who are running the Democrats and who have lost races\nAnd so I can imagine that there's probably a little bit of animals there you know if their approach to say something ignorant well\nYou know I'm a spokesman for an organization that endorse their opponents so\nSo there is a little there's a little motivation there\nBut I have never understood\nThat you know somebody that would value\nOptical an in public your political ideologies so much that you would you like you can't say I'm not going to offer an opinion on that I have my beliefs they have their beliefs\nBut their blood and and I respect that they have different beliefs\nI don't believe blood attacks blood and public\nAnd even if some of the people in my family\nBy the way even if some of them they say they they believe the same thing and they don't practice at I at least\nI always with God's that God had his siblings they made a commercial for his opponent and they said the meanest things about him\nAnd then you have ... what is this an aunt and some distant cousins over crying out loud\nAct like they they stop at his house every Sunday give me a break\nYeah I it was about politics for these people\nAnd it was an easy choice because there are some people who get butterflies in their stomach is the thought of having their name in print\nEven if it means the price to do so as to bash on one of their own\nSuch transgressions aren't easily forgotten\nSome of them they say they they believe the same thing and they don't practice it I at least\nI always with God's that God had his siblings they made a commercial for his opponent and they said the meanest things about him\nAnd then you have ... what is this an aunt and some distant cousins over crying out loud\nAct like they they stop at his house every Sunday give me a break\nYeah I it was about politics for these people\nAnd it was an easy choice because there are some people who get butterflies in their stomach is the thought of having their name in print\nEven if it means the price to do so as to bash on one of their own\nSuch transgressions aren't easily forgotten\nBut that that's that I feel I feel bad for that I saw that what about lax all and I thought that's just awful\nAnd and change it I Can't imagine Gosar going back to his family can you imagine those are his siblings\nAfter you after somebody does something I mean you can forgive people but that doesn't mean you walk on them back in your inner circle you know what I mean\nOnce you've been betrayed like that you can never get that back\nYou can forgive but you never open yourself up to that again\nWith him it was his immediate family of lax all that some distant cousins were like well hey come on now\nIs this silly just silly\nI'm gonna see the ground here so ... my\nSon my youngest son\nHis he's got a birthday coming up\nAnd he had asked\nFor one or two things and one of two things only\nHe would prefer ... but he would settle for a praying mantis\nAnd I thought one is weird\nAnd the other is is my biggest fear\nI was outside this morning and I fell down a hill\nBecause I thought I Walk into a spider Web\nAnd it ... I didn't just like stumble in the fall and get back on you know I fell and rolled\nDownhill because I thought I walked into a spider Web\nAnd I'm like that's the only that's why I was saying yesterday all these stories of these people that were driving our cars and a spider dropped on their leg or does the girl who ran into a telephone pole because the spider dropped under her head yes it is I Would do the same thing\nSo I asked the Internet for help and they were not helpful and they told me some pretty terrifying things\nReally I mean that kind of was I guess they did\nTo me to say sorry no\nI might lie to him and be like oh they die faster in captivity or something like that anyway so\nWe'll discuss we've got a bunch of other things to hit on his well\nIn the meantime outdoor limited

I'm going to say it and just a minute\nI have with me Dr Stewart and she's the executive director of recovery yeah\nThey have three locations and unfortunately they did say they are growing because there's a need for it there is need for it um at one is in Scottsdale at that one on one and ... there are also opening very soon in Tempe and metro Phoenix you want to check out their website it is Rick ... dot com you can\nIf a true\nBack every one topic not everybody really wants to talk about\nThe very important ah and we I was just talking to you at the break about the different types of a substance abuse and we want to get this out that it's not just opiate I'm going to say it and just a minute\nI have with me Dr Stewart and she's the executive director of recovery yet\nThey have three locations and unfortunately they did say they are growing because there's a need for it there is need for it um at one is in Scottsdale at that one on one end Pima they're also opening very soon in Tempe and metro Phoenix you want to check out their website it is recovery ya\nDot com you can also call them the obviously will do it for assessment with you and talk to you a little bit about whether it's you or someone that you know\nFor into seven one two four six zero zero they take most major insurance as well as Medicare I'm so at the break when I was asking is it only opiates that you work with and you said no go ahead no we ... the original program\nWas designed for individuals with chronic pain who had developed opioid dependence and what we found actually was a kind of\nA miraculous insurance got a hold of outcomes and they contacted us and said we're very interested in your model the bio psycho social model has a lot of research behind it for addiction\nAnd the way you're doing it is the way it should be done it's called the gold standard of health care and it will be in the future Carol how we manage all kinds of health issues including obesity in including diabetes but\nFor now the bio psycho social model is is definitely recognized as the um the elite model in health care\nSo we piloted that's for substance abuse in general just substance abuse treatment\nThe model the modules itself states very true to form\nThe outcome stay very very very solid let's talk about what it is because you know you mentioned it and it it's extensive to what you actually do with them right so ... psychosocial model is exactly as it sounds we're looking at the biology we're looking at the social component\nWe're looking at the mental component so all of these things go into place so we talked about before\nPeople that walks through the door recovery and say I think I Need help for whatever reason whether it's a loved one that said it or they had a catalyst moment um there was so much that happened before that person walk through that door it wasn't one thing it wasn't just the medication it wasn't\nJust that um they've struggled with mood for a while it it was it's all those things together and if\nA treatment program isn't looking at that on a coordinated level they're not doing any one any justice because it's all those things that are going to create change\nSo they're coming into a program and not only are they seeing three different disciplines everyday medical\nBehavioral physical therapy but these this team talks to each other as a as weekly staffing and we have our own little literal language so we talk about these patients all the time\nWe know what patient is doing what where they're at what they're benefiting from their treatment plan will adjusted according to how the teams use them doing it's unlike anything that I've ever seen in Arizona and that is why it works\nOut it's really awesome I ... I also wanted to say that ah when you when you're working with somebody a fake I I I I was so interested in what you were saying was forgot what I was going to say there are tons of ah you said a success stories yeah you've had I'd like to talk about it\nThings that are going to create change so they're coming into a program and not only are they seeing three different disciplines everyday medical\nBehavioral physical therapy but these this team talks to each other as as weekly staffing and we have our own little literal language so we talk about these patients all the time\nWe know what patient is doing what where they're at what they're benefiting from their treatment plan will adjusted according to how the teams use them doing it's unlike anything that I've ever seen in Arizona and that is why it works out it's really awesome I ...\nI also wanted to say that ah when you when you're working with somebody or they ... I I I was so interested in what you were saying was forgot what I was going to say there are tons of ah you said a success stories yeah you've had I'd like to talk about\nAt least one of them if you could before we go to a break and we were we go you know leave for today okay I'm going to try and keep it short we have a lot luckily I have the best job in the world\nI'm going to talk about a piece in all the name him Daniel that's not his name but for the purpose of this um he came in\nProgram about three years ago she had to um fusion lower back fusion says are significant back surgeries he walked with a cane he was thirty two years old\nAnd he was walking with a cane and he had gained about Seventy pounds he had been on a long term opiate therapy for five years he was injured on the job never return to work came into program\nA lot of what we we educate patients about and program it's not just the neurobiology of addiction and substance but the neurobiology of pain itself\nAnd pain is actually a protector it's not a it's not an offender at the defender and we teach them the construct of pain in their brain it's like I said it's very psychologically rooted so would you sneaky spike in every discipline that we do there\nWhat do you learned is is not only to normalize and change how his brain\nI'm perceived and protect with pain but he learned that he could move safely and the more he moved the more he got that same signal the more he was able to move the next day and so on and so forth this is an individual who had an audible click\nIn his back when he walked so something wasn't right legitimately something wasn't right at the end of program\nHe was he was not using the Cain he lost twenty five pounds\nAnd more and more importantly um his wife was pregnant so that's awful for another us another story for another day so we had\nAll of these amazing things happen in a very short period of time\nAnd what I think is most important as it's not a teacher or a fix for chronic pain that's not what we're saying but what he learned to do is to normalize managers pain and comprehensive way so that he's able to not function not not use the Cain and he does have a little adjustment with his back when he fills the click\nAnd then he's able to sit down relax but her shoulders don't have a conversation I he came to mind because he brought his daughter\nWho is now to the program a couple of weeks ago and she's beautiful um it just reminds me that I'm with the right here in the right program and there's lots of good programs recovery is obviously not the only one but\nHelp if you know someone helped direct them in the right the right path because they can really really do think they can get over this well what I'm hearing is that you are doing something that it's a ... far more than anybody out there because it's this new wave\nOf our way treatment whether or not now I'm hearing that it's not just for addiction that it's going to be treatment for weight loss for many many things which almost makes so so much perfect sense because it all comes from deep within all of our I mean you know you\nConversation I he came to mind because he brought his daughter\nWho is now to the program a couple of weeks ago and she's beautiful and it just reminds me that I'm with the right here in the right program and there's lots of good programs recovery is obviously not the only one but\nHelp if you know someone helped direct them in the right the right path because they can really really do think they can get over this well what I'm hearing is that you are doing something that it's a ... far more than anybody out there because it's this new wave\nOf our way treatment whether or not now I'm hearing that it's not just for addiction that it's going to be treatment for weight loss for many many things which almost makes so so much perfect sense because it all comes from deep within all of our I mean you know you could be addicted to food\nRight you love there's a lot of different things that you may not necessarily be ingesting but you're addicted to at work they got ... so there's so many and it's all deep rooted why from the way along with the stuff that was\nExactly so we call it reward circuitry and program we talk about long term and short term reward circuitry we talk about how the brain has gotten used to get her short term rewards which is addiction and avoidance that's all addiction is really avoidance when it comes down to it\nAnd then we talk about building long term reward circuitry which is like a rich bridge over that is very short circuit\nAnd that's what we're doing so that's why consistency is important that's way finding the right program is important\nBecause that's exactly right we're taking old behaviors we're building a new one over them we're not going to get rid of the old one but we can definitely work on building new healthy ones now also you said and I remember was I said before which is that they are customized programs and so it's not that there's something to meet each person's needs because\nEvery one is different right and you can't just do the same thing with each and every individual right exactly so that first day that evaluated evaluated day is the day that that the team gets together at the end of the day and we say that the person that candidate yes or no and if so\nWhat would we like to see that maybe has there been stolen left unturned that becomes their program and that's so when we talk about module through including it maybe there's chronic pain maybe there's mood regulation\nMaybe there's um intensive physical therapy it really depends on what has\nWhat was their experience and our construct that happened before that now we need to treat and if I have time I just want to say we don't go backwards a lot and program\nSo even though it's a very psychologically based very much behavior program we don't spend a lot of time going backwards because our what we do is we say you're here and we understand that what happened here impacts pain impacts mood impacts how your functioning\nBut what we really need to do is take these constructs and figure out how to make them more functional more healthy so that we can get you here\nGoing backwards it's not it's helpful in this type of a program in anything yes yeah so you so very different not very much not a traditional um psychotherapy approach to addiction\nAbsolutely now what I also want to talk to the audience about it this is the greatest time of year that you're you're not say that every time every any day could be he was gay but right now\nIt's the end of October were coming to the end of the year and a lot of people are now thinking about New Year's\nResolutions just a little bit maybe not a lot but just a little bit about you know what's going on what about a wonderful thing to give yourself or someone that you love someone that you know the gift of\nFreedom of addiction ... let's say um and again we want to make sure that you understand almost any uh you said how many different uh different uh addictions that you cover\nSo we will treat 'em any substance abuse so it can we see patients in with that are I'm addicted to\nNot very much not a traditional um psychotherapy approach to addiction absolutely now what I also want to talk to the audience about is this the greatest time of year that you're you're not say that every time every any day could be he was gay but right now\nIt's the end of October were coming to the end of the year and a lot of people are now thinking about New Year's resolution just a little bit maybe not a lot but just a little bit about you know what's going on what about a wonderful thing to give yourself\nOr someone that you love someone that you know\nThe gift of freedom of addiction ... let's say um and again we want to make sure that you understand almost any uh you said how many different uh different uh\nAddictions that you cover so we will treat 'em any substance abuse so it can we see patients and ... that are I'm addicted to\nAlcohol at are all I'm ... as a means obviously opioids we have some exclusion criteria for certain substances which we can screen out with phone calls but for the most part we accept everything we're we're looking at getting this person functioning pretty much no matter what\nPaid for funded I don't think that that's necessarily the best option for every body which is which is not typical of what is um so you see said by by most people's ... to ...\nTotally right now I mean I Would say that would never fought my in my mind that we would say that but I'm so glad we are because you know you are a younger generation and you so you have different um different ways of doing things you know little okay that's perfect I'm Glad we're talking that tell us what those would be\nUm [noise] so in the past so uh\nSo in the past funeral home ... and still today funeral homes have to be ready to respond at a moment's notice to someone's need\nUm I I Will answer a phone call it at two o'clock in the morning on Christmas Eve and I have I have to show up for that same that person in the same way as if it was you know\nTwo o'clock on a Monday afternoon and I'm In my office or because they are needed the same and so I Need to respond the same way and that's been consistent throughout your service I'm a ... a funeral home in the Nineteen fifties\nYou know they they would always have to have someone there at\nThat facility twenty four hours a day to be able to answer the phone and to take care of transportation needs and um\nYou know there's there's significant overhead and cost associated with maintaining that twenty four seven ability to to respond and to fulfill those neat I'm as time has gone on in that check\nAnd a moment's notice to someone's need um I I Will answer a phone call at two o'clock in the morning on Christmas Eve and I have I have to show up for that same that person that same way as if it was you know\nTwo o'clock on a Monday afternoon and I'm In my office um because they're needed the same and so I Need to respond the same way and that's been consistent throughout your service I'm a ... a funeral home in the Nineteen fifties\nYou know they they would always have to have someone there at\nThat facility twenty four hours a day to be able to answer the phone and to take care of transportation needs and um\nYou know there's there's significant overhead and cost associated with maintaining that twenty four seven ability to to respond and to fulfill those neat\nI'm as time has gone on in that check as technology has has advanced um that ability becomes a lot um a lot more accessible um and so\nUh in in that sense um [noise] uh\nI feel like I I feel like we can be more more responsive more efficient have a lower overhead than what would have been necessary in the past to be able to provide the level of service that people really do need mhm so because of that overhead and efficiency um you know\nThe the total cost can be typically lower than what what a lot of people might expect\nRight now you said that when you work with people first of all you do a free consultation you're located in Mesa and the use service anyone in the valley anywhere in the valley\nYeah so all of Maricopa County and then those are municipalities in ... county that are continuous with the Phoenix metro area like Santa ... junction mhm um we service all of those areas without any additional fees for transportation\nSo by a ... because of the way we live today and that ... that we live in is that uh with technology funerals can be a lot less money then people can expect or they can be also very expensive depending on\nWhen the wind it depends too because certainly like there's a lot of um it depends on your approach right um there's a lot of a very reputable funeral establishment in the valley that have a long tradition of\nOf of of service to the community and they just have a different business model they you know it's they they came up in a different a time when things were just different than they are now I'm\nSo kind of the differentiation with horizon funeral cares we offer the same type of services as anybody else does um but we're able to do it with greater efficiency\nI'm Better responsiveness and at a lower cost than some other places so which they all I mean I'm that's everyone just kinda does it their own way and we just want to connect with people who appreciate right we do things\nAnd that's what we're going to do right now because you do free consultation with people and the first thing is as you want to fight you know call him up and find out yet your plant in order and they can tell you how inexpensive that you can have this done through them\nCertainly everyone should have a plan um pre paying for that plan it might be a good idea in your situation where it might not and we can hope we can help\nAnd so you do these free consultations with people and also he wants to know that they're there at any note it's all you have to do is give him a call and he will be there for you by your side doesn't matter what time and because of the way that that and I loved it because I've never talked about it this way\nAnd it's awesome because people don't think about it that ... honestly that's way most people think that funerals are just really expensive\nThey're either going to get cremated or not or whatever and that I like I said it I got you\nAnd that's what we're going to do right now because you do free consultation with people and the first thing is as you want to find you know call him up and find out get your plants in order and they can tell you how inexpensive that you can have this done through them\nCertainly everyone should have a plan I'm preparing for that when it might be a good idea in your situation where it might not and we can hope\nAnd so you do these free consultations with people and also he wants to know that they're there at any notice all you have to do is give him a call and he will be there for you by your side doesn't matter what time and because of the way that that and I loved it because I've never talked about it this way\nAnd it's awesome because people don't think about it the ... honestly that's way most people think the funerals are just really expensive\nThey're either going to get cremated or not or whatever and that I like I said it I thought you knew in you steered me in the right direction because I figured you got it all tied up in a bowl and it's done and it's not and you're absolutely right about that because when you go in there at that moment of time it's never going to be I'm All right it's never going to be all perfect right\nCorrect nothing's going to go the way that it has been planned for years before there's going to be contingency\nAbsolutely now your your website is horizon funeral care dot com they're located in Mesa their phone number direct right the number down you'd never know when you need it it's for Ito\nThree three eight one for nine seven they service the entire valley and they do
