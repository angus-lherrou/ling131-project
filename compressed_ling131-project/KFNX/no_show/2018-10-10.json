to bomb Syria\nNow on what do I base my opinion she was bellicose from the beginning\nShe was bombastic and bellicose at the same time and very threatening she was the exact opposite of what an ambassador as opposed to big and the bachelor is supposed to make peace not war Haley won in there with one mission which was to caused dissention with Russia\nThrough Syria and by bombing Syria again based on the false flag of a chemical attack\nWhich I kept pointing out over and over again it's a false flag false flag false flag false flag or about to a release gas and say that Assad did it I pointed out over and over again aside would be an insane individualized would put in to do this when they're\nWhen they've got ISIS backed in a corner in one city they wouldn't do it and somehow\nPeople within the Trump Administration\nHeard this viewpoint and decided not to unleash another Tomahawk missile attack on the Syrians even though they were ready to do so they were on the

man in the administration is that in the ... plant\nOr in the national security advisor ship position and Nikki Haley the two of them wanted war and the worst way they would bloodthirsty and they wanted war but for some reason the non global is around from\nWar of the winners and they prevented them from launching against Syria and from provoking a war with Russia which is a fantastic well as

engaging the same censorship as Twitter and Facebook\nYou know you can't have it both ways all the conservative scream about Twitter and Facebook censoring them and their right to do so and Twitter and Facebook should not be allowed to do that\nWhy well although they're private companies they become so large and so dominant they are like public utilities and based on that argument the same can be applied to Fox News ... because as a conservative outlet and the only conservative outlet and television\nIt is like Facebook and Twitter for conservatives is it not\nSo if they blacklist someone like me and I'm not the only one\nBut I'm the most prominent one I Am a best selling author I'm revered by millions and yet because of personal vendettas within that company\nAnd outright fear of an

defining parts immorality\nIllegality the problem for progressive is is that the first is subjective and often clashes with the ladder for example the bakery that refuses to make a cake for gay couple\nWhen any entrenched group feels threatened by a newly formed identity be they marry gays free blacks or transplanted Hispanics who don't necessarily speak the language\nHysteria on the local and national level is invariably that result how that is manifest whether by the formation of the Ku Klux Klan or massive deportations depends entirely on the wisdom and broad based compassion of our

Benjamin Franklin set of Americans just before you fix the signature on a declaration of independence we must indeed all hang together or most assuredly will show hang separately does that not apply today\nAnd applies exactly to what has been happening not just with Kavanaugh in this case but with all of these smears against\nUm you you against other people in the media and and it can absolutely go if if for example the me too movement can also be used against Democrats and people are going to sit there and use it as a\nPolitical weapon and so it looks like the pendulum swing way too far and you're pointing out that this mass hysteria and the guillotine at the end of the day comes for everybody if that's what you if that had a revolution that's right that they're pushing you\nSeen as a Thursday blade it has no political affiliation\nAnd when the left starts dropping it on the right and then the women started dropping it on the men they don't understand what will happen next study

to life charities I thought I'd share with you if you didn't catch it in the opening part of the introduction that my being Bruce Nixon is\nSort of a bifurcated personality on my part I was born\nAt the end of August in Nineteen sixty seven Ronald Reagan signed into law and marches Nineteen sixty seven the therapeutic abortion act\nAnd that doesn't mean anything to anybody I didn't say wow you were born at the end of August so it\nTurns out that my young mother was Fifteen Years old turning sixteen was raped\nIn Nineteen sixty six and so\nOn that cost of having legalized abortion you might say well my gosh she was raped she should have failed you suppose that has a train of thought I don't agree with the train of thought but let's just go down that avenue she did not she went to a hospital with a family gave birth to me at the end of August\nNineteen sixty seven where I was the band it for three months\nAnd people say well so why well you're right so what I mean I was abandoned lots of kids are abandoned in the hospital nothing big their rights so then I was I thought my whole adult life I'm fifty one this year I thought my whole adult life that someone\nMy adopted parents came to the hospital pick me up and then I became who I Am today well it turns out that at that time in California you also had to be fostered before you were adopted so I guess you figure it out September October sometime in early November\nI went home with Georgia in ... in San Francisco and for the first year I spent with them my legal name at birth was Bruce next but I didn't know that until later in life and so\nI grew up spent my entire life in the service to the United states coast guard in college where every I might be jobs at John\nYou're right so what I mean I was abandoned lots of kids are banned in the hospital nothing big their rights so then I was I thought my whole adult life I'm fifty one this year I thought my whole adult life that someone\nMy adopted parents came to the hospital pick me up and then I became who I Am today well it turns out that at that time in California you also had to be fostered before you were adopted so I guess you figure it out in September October sometime in early November\nI went home with George and read a ... in San Francisco and for the first year I spent with them my legal name at birth was Bruce next but I didn't know that until later in life and so\nI grew up spent my entire life in the service to the United states coast guard in college where every I might be jobs that John Lewis and you come to the coffee shop\nHere it seventh street and done lap you would meet the skipper John ... so in my bifurcated self at the age of forty nine my parents were getting older and probably need him to go to sit there living and\nI was in their living room and San Francisco one day and my mother came down with a lot of paperwork and said here I think you ought to see this\nAnd it was that day I guess a couple of years ago I discovered that at birth until\nI was a year and a couple of months old\nMy real name my born legal name was Bruce Nixon so that's the the impetus behind the Bruce Nixon life charities is there's a story behind everybody's life and that's part of my story\nBorn Bruce Nixon living as John Lewis on the radio is Bruce Nixon of Bruce Nixon life charities and our endeavor is to help educate people into the the real issues that will help save lives whether it be of the unborn the elderly or the infirm and all those things that\nCome in between and there's a lot of work to do in that regard ah as far as education and sharing the truth about things that\nAre important to life not necessarily because\nOf any religious instincts although religion does inform the mind and faith\nBut really as a matter of fact of science and we'll get into and just a moment but tonight the program again going to address the singular issue in light of the Kavanaugh nomination in subsequent bench ... is that a weren't venturing\nSitting on the bench of the United States Supreme court the Kavanaugh hearings and the cabinet appointment have led many on both sides to say things like\nWell we're going to get rid of roe v Wade or yeah we're going to get rid of her over the way\nAnd I thought you might want to have some\nActual history of ... wrote what roe v Wade is and is not and how the Supreme Court takes on issues as it turns out my own a bone a few days here as I spent\nMy whole adult life working on issues surrounding supporting life for the unborn Evelyn from I spent twelve years on Capitol Hill to paid lobbyist impact Herman for Nebraska largest pro life group representing sixty thousand nebraskan are under the banner of nebraskan genetic for life\nAlso participated in the ... election cycle\nAs a Republican candidate a Republican candidate for the Nebraska Senate so I Am informed on the issue one might even asked me to be an expert in testimony in court of law and what I'm going to share with you\nA lot of things that I have learned in the past Twenty years of active duty so to speak in the\nQuote unquote pro life movement but more importantly much well plus years on Capitol Hill inside the halls of the United States Senate in the halls of the house of representatives and governors' mansions et cetera et cetera so\nFor my spent twelve years on Capitol Hill to paid lobbyist impact German for Nebraska largest pro life group representing sixty thousand Nebraska guns are under the banner of nebraskan United for life\nAlso participated in the ... election cycle\nAs a Republican candidate a Republican candidate for\nThe Nebraska Senate so I Am informed on the issue one might even asked me to be an expert in testimony in court of law and what I'm going to share with you\nA lot of things that I have learned in the past Twenty years of active duty so to speak in the\nQuote unquote pro life movement but more importantly much well plus years on Capitol Hill inside the halls of the United States Senate in the halls of the house of representatives and governors' mansions et cetera et cetera so that's the backdrop\nAgain my bona feed age a little history about Bruce Nixon were only a couple of minutes from the bottom of the aisle or break but here's the setup roe v Wade as a companion case that was litigated uh initially in Nineteen Seventy in Texas Norma Corey was the ah plaintiff\nState of Texas the defendant and Norma Corey uh was used by Planned Parenthood and others to be the model she was pregnant she didn't want to be pregnant at the time halfway during her pregnancy\nSo it's one of the great ironies of the life issues movement on whatever side that the poster child for the statutory requirement that states don't block abortion Norma Corey row in roe v Wade\nActually had her own child\nAnd later grew up to be in an advocate a pro life\nSpeaker uh I met her twice once I interviewed her on the radio in Washington DC had the great privilege of getting to know her just for an hour or two or I might comment that she since gone to the lord and I know that she carried heavily with her that responsibility that she was the impetus for that\nBut it was a companion to another case called do be voting and subsequent a case ah I Can't remember the planet versus voice which are another case about the help of mother so there's a lot of cases to go over\nUm a lot of people on both sides they are worried about who overturned who and when\nBut when we come back we'll give you a little bit of history or we will also get into a very interesting\nAnd compelling a little discussion about how long this debate has been going on in the United states and from there we will take it I'm into the second segment so here again and about I don't know ten Fifteen seconds or so\nYou're going to hear some music I'm going to go away when we come back\nUm we will tell you\nMore about this issue in the meantime I Want to say the ... the show was brought to you in part by poetry which is a delicious provider of dog food cat food seasonings for your pets dogs cats turtles and more [laughter] I Do that in there because our sponsors probably listening on the Web at hot tree\nDon I Want to say the ... the show was brought to you in part by poetry which is a delicious provider of dog food cat food seasonings for your pets dogs cats turtles and more [laughter] I Do that in there because our sponsors probably listening on the Web at heart tree\nIn this belief that we have expressed the unanimous opinion of the association or respect our report is respectfully submitted\nNow that's a powerful stuff I read verbatim from a report given to um the Congress and many legislators and governors this is an a a committee that was appointed\nThe title of the committee's work is called transactions of the American Medical Association so this is the American Medical Association\nThe report was\nA commission in Eighteen fifty seven\nDelivered to the recipients in Eighteen fifty nine\nSo you might imagine that this has been going on\nThis is really quite a deep subject and it has been around for a very very very long time\nThis is something that I think we all ought to remember as we move forward in the discourse in the post Kavanaugh error that this is nothing short of a a debate that's gone on since the beginning of time\nThe American Medical Association Eighteen fifty nine drawing the conclusion that yeah there's got to be a better way and we are advocating for a better way but as it pertains to law\nUm we have what I like to call the top ten list\nWhen justice black men delivered his majority opinion creating roe v Wade as precedent for the United straight or the United States Supreme court with a companion case if there'll be Bolden he did so in an extensive way\nAnd in his oral history are released upon his death around two thousand four he really unpacked I invite you to go to a library of Congress and download the oral history on video you can watch it there while they unpacked in his own words why\nHe made the decision and had other justices standby decision at that time but within the confines of this um we have a top ten list of the errors one might find in roe v waited that law and not that this report ... but\nI'm referring to it as law because no state show a bridge it in the fact that a rape and sets in life and the mother Brawley construed and we and then a time but here's the top ten list\nAnd in his oral history are released upon his death around two thousand four he really impact I invite you to go to a library of Congress\nAnd download the oral history it's on video\nYou can watch it there while they unpacked in his own words why he made the decision and had other justices stand by his decision at that time but within the confines of this\nUm we have a top ten list of the errors one might find in a row the weight of that law and not that this report makes law but\nI'm referring to it as law because no state shell a bridge it\nIn the fact that a\nRape and sets in life and the mother Brawley construed and we and then a time but here's the top ten list\nDominion is applied to a woman alone so in the in the opinion so many and the woman has dominion over everything even the unborn child\nAnd we might point here to the Brandeis court uh practically Nineteen forty one where children were finally we outlawed child labor United States\nWants to crawl under the Brandeis court by saying that parents have what's known as the trust dominion over their children they can't enslaved them they don't own them but they have a trust dominion over them black men overlooks this but we'd like to refresh this is part of the lively debate as that\nMom alone does not have the dominion or an ownership over\nHer unborn child she has what we would call\nA trust dominion\nThe second and this descending order\nBlackmon rights that pre born human life is only potential life\nAnd she just so on the on the ball scientific acknowledgement that obviously\nIt's not a an inanimate object of any kind so to say that it's only potential life\nWould really be a disservice to\nScience itself so again pre born human life is only quote potential life I think we can say as a matter of fact um any uh\nSeattle development course would outline that as a flat outlined number three\nThey only interest that states have reasonably\nAccording to Blackmon is viability so he raises deaths in several paragraphs that if you think about the reasonable interest of the state to protect the unborn\nHe makes the case that\nViability is that measure and I think you've seen that I think if you're honest than you Google it\nYou can see that states for\nThe last Twenty years have made a number of laws regarding viability and in the last five years in particular gone after the fetal pain as a threshold I might be wrong but I think the youngest\nOr the earliest on and development that life is protected in any state is about twenty weeks maybe twenty two weeks\nAbout halfway or\nBecause of the pain not necessarily viability but black men again in this number three point makes the case that viability is the measure of states interests that I Would say of course that's\nA changing its fluids so if this is supposed to be truth insofar as you hold it against the background of eternity\nTruth champion moving target either is or isn't so viability is out\nNumber for the common law and I just read to you that a article for American Medical association\nThe lady and the last five years in particular gone after the fetal pain as a threshold I might be wrong but I think the youngest\nOr the earliest on and development that life is protected in any state is about twenty weeks maybe twenty two weeks\nAbout halfway or because of the pain not necessarily liability but black men again in this number three point makes the case that viability is the measure of states interest and I would say of course that's\nA changing its fluids so if this is supposed to be truth insofar as you hold it against the background of eternity\nTruth champion moving target either is it is so viability is out\nNumber for\nThe common law and I just read to you that a article for American Medical association from Eighteen fifty nine\nThey refer to this is well the common law may no effort to prosecute abortion before\nThe so called quick inning of the unborn\nBlack then goes into great detail saying well you know no one's ever done that\nAnd doing the research on that you might out and you know talk to people all the time\nI remember having come a long conversations with US Senator Ben Nelson\nAbout this very subject uh that well no one's ever done it before why should we do now\nSeems like a very weak argument but they may is trying to say even a hundred plus years ago that we had the case\nThat they knew then that obviously this is not true that the ... measure of the sanctity of life so that one's out as well\nAnd this one black men points out\nTakes about a paragraph or to the point just went out one of my favorites because it's really bizarre but that's in there so\nHe says quote pregnancy often comes more than once to the same woman\nAnd in the general population is managed to survive it will always be with us and quote\nSo let me I mean if you didn't get that quote what he's saying as women get pregnant more than once so what's the big deal\nIf you're worried about safeguarding the human race don't worry women get pregnant again and again\nNot just this one off situation I don't even know where to begin on that argument other than yeah whatever so if you're worth is only as much as it's useful to saving the race to fill in the blanks\nIn other words like some people have one boy and one girl and they think that they've replaced themselves but they failed to realize that attrition means you need about to point to kids to replace every couple do the math and you need multiple children every family just to sustain your population\nSo you don't go into demographic winter but again children aren't things so we are not speak of them as things to be filling in the banks of the population\n[noise] All right so that was number five number six\nAnd again one of my all time favorites Hippocrates and the Hippocratic Oath and he takes it on by saying the Hippocratic Oath was only narrowly held by a very small cult of Greeks\nSo if you're not familiar with the Hippocratic Oath it starts you know basically go by saying that a doctor would offer no history forward abortion or drugs you know another word for drugs and that's the way back in the way back machine\nThe properties of the ancient you know the father of medicine so to speak so\nHe makes broccoli makes the can't claim in a row the way that\nThe Hippocratic Oath was only narrowly held by a small group of Greeks and I don't know what the year was I should have done some research on this but I I'm pretty sure it wasn't expelled and medical schools they forgot to go until sometime in the late\nAll right so\nThat was number five number six\nAnd again one of my all time favorites Hippocrates and the Hippocratic Oath and he takes it on by saying the Hippocratic Oath was only narrowly held by a very small cult of Greeks\nSo if you're not familiar with the Hippocratic Oath that starts you know basically go by saying that a doctor would offer no history for and abortion or drugs you know another

that\nThe Hippocratic Oath was only narrowly held by a small group of Greeks\nAnd I don't know what the year was I should have done some research on this but I I'm pretty sure it wasn't expelled and medical schools they forgot to go until sometime in the late seventies when it became apparent that it would probably be no good to say the doctors you couldn't provide offense to refer abortion if they're around\nBoth offering chemicals in surgical abortion All right so that that\nNumber seven another another on the big you could see they get better and better as we get on the list\nA boy this is according to black men of course abortion laws were only essentially enacted\nTo save women from unsafe medical procedures\nOkay so we only outlaw abortion not to save the lives of unborn children but because women were having botched abortion this sounds like a page out of ... or Planned Parenthood which in fact it was [laughter] they Rob my old deceased friend or Dr\nBernard Nathan said he and I spent some time together and uh in New York City and I interviewed him on the radio multiple times\nAt the President's Day rally made this claim\nPat and why he admitted to it as president and they rallied lied\nAnd this is a lie of course you wouldn't outlaw the death of a newborn child to protect the woman from a botched medical procedure that makes no sense at all\nMen his father Lee writes\nI don't know maybe there's some men listening tonight that ah have experienced is in their past but a ... I Know for many dozens if not hundreds of men that I've met over the years that have had women have an abortion it's horrific in its self\nEdgy male dot com thanks your gender your contributions we stay on the air because we like being on the radio with you to help educate the public on what's going on with all the issues regarding life\nFrom the unborn to the elderly and the ... from for everyone here have Bruce next life charities we're going to sign off here and just a moment from life all copies studios they have any questions that you like answered\nEdgy male dot com thanks your gender your contributions we stay on the end because\nWe like being on the radio with you to help educate the public on what's going on with all the issues regarding life from the unborn to the elderly and the firm for everyone here at Bruce snakes live charities we're going to sign off here and just a moment from\n... studios if you have any questions that you'd like answered\n'em you can send them via email or you can send them via the Facebook page if you were like a copy of the entire defense of the unborn which father Clifford Stevens and I co authored a few years back\nPlease send an email and we will get you a copy\nAgain thanks so much for being with us we're certainly glad you've spent the time to be here and I hope you have a wonderful and blessed evening would talk to your next Tuesday night at nine o five right here on M. eleven hundred K.

question which was funny\nWhich was is this good or bad for the Jews what is being done to Kavanaugh at that time\nAnd Savage said quote when Jews are good they are great but when they're bad they're very dangerous\nSavage pointed out adding quote the smartest yet most dangerous person today is Bernie Sanders he is so smart he knows exactly what he is doing he models this platform from the power Minnesota the Bolshevik Revolution is energizing this frenzy among the young ...\nOf course we discuss the cabinet hysteria\nAnd he said the check off the smear Kavanaugh was challenged in last male

that Haley resigned suddenly because she failed to ignite a war with Russia and failed to get Trump to bomb Syria\nNow on what do I base my opinion she was bellicose from the beginning\nShe was bombastic and bellicose at the same time and very threatening she was the exact opposite of what an ambassador as opposed to big and a bachelor is supposed to make peace not war Haley went in there with one mission which was to cause dissension with Russia\nThrough Syria and by bombing Syria again based on the false flag of a chemical attack\nWhich I kept pointing out over and over again it's a false flag false flag false flag false flag or about to release gas and say that I saw that it I pointed out over and over again is I Will be an insane individualized would put in to do this when they're\nWhen they got I suspect in a corner in one city they wouldn't do it and somehow\nPeople within the Trump Administration\nHeard this viewpoint and decided not to unleash another Tomahawk missile attack on the Syrians even though they were ready to do so they were on the verge four weeks ago I don't know if you remember and who was beating the drum for the launch of Tomahawk against

or may not have an easy time in the Senate I don't know but um you know one of the things that many of us are the buyer hugely about a Nikki Haley of course has been um the absolutely\nForthright and ... and\nWell even courageous championing of American interests in\nThe United nations specifically in the middle east and most especially with respect to Israel\nAnd unfortunately in my experience Dina it'd be Powell is not the Nikki Haley on any of those things and those are of course the president's policies you'd expect her to chat with them but um she has been in again my experience I'm very much susceptible to the uh\nThey blend dish mints shall we say of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United states she hails from Egypt originally and I think this would be a terrible mistake so I Hope that's not where the president's gonna wind up but uh you're right\nLars or anybody is going to face a the gauntlet uh unless this is this going to come up presumably after uh the ... on the election and perhaps the Democrats were the case and uh let's hope so\nWell tell me this one of the things I fail to understand Frank is when someone takes a job working for someone or some thing either an entity a business entity or ... political entity a and says I really don't\nSubscribe to the beliefs of this entity the policies are the charter of this group or I don't know I'm going to work for a person and I don't agree with him but I'll take the job\nAnd then I'll deliberately and we've seen this happen in the Trump Administration a bunch of times in the last two years just say I'm going to take the job and then I'm going to do whatever the heck I Want to do with the job no matter what the boss things why do people do that and why did they get away with it\n\nThink they do it because um they also have the hubris ah to think that they know better than the president said appointed to that position they often or or even contemptuous\nOf the person who is on the job and the question is as you say how do they get away with it um and unfortunately in the first year of the Trump Administration there was altogether too much of that [noise] uh I think probably at least in part because\nThe ministry and a bunch of times in the last two years to say I'm going to take the job and then I'm going to do whatever the heck I Want to do with the job no matter what the boss things why do people do that and why did they get away with it\n\nI think they do it because um they also have the hubris ah to think that they know better than the president said appointed them to that position they often uh or even contemptuous\nOf the person who based on the job\nAnd the question is as you say how do they get away with it um and unfortunately in the first year of the Trump Administration there was altogether too much of that [noise]\nUh I think probably at least in part because of the president was you know spending most of his of waking hours trying to contend with the various ah ah investigations and allegations and\nUh and other personnel challenges and the occasional crisis or two and a as a result you know folks who should have been called\nTo account words and it only incentivize them to do more of it and\nFrankly it serves as an example for others to do the same so that's a problem and I think it's gotten considerably better my sense of it at least as a with my palm pilot state and John Bolton that the national Security Council or at least in those parts of the of the national security arena\nThe that's the thing I've wondered about because frankly honestly there are some groups have the ACLU\nCalled me up and said will pay a pile of money to come down and be our press spokesman for the ACLU I'd say thank you very much know immediately no I don't fit I I Believe in civil liberties I don't believe in the way that they're doing it on the other hand there might be individuals that I Would say yes to quickly or no to quickly\nBut I Can't imagine going to work and promising to take\nA paycheck to do a job intending to not do the job because I think and and intending if anything to undercut the you know the the belief in the philosophy the person I'm going to work for unless I sat down with him and said yeah\nI'll go to work for you but I Believe the way you been doing things is wrong and you can do much better if you do it my way and if your employer your\nProspective employers is why you're probably right we'll let you change the way we're doing things then you might take the job but\nDeciding to deliberately torpedo your employers to satisfy some other goal\nI I just do not under the I Can't wrap my head around it Frank\n... well ... and this is why you know unfortunately uh we have a lot of swamp creatures and very few Lars Larson [laughter] so we could we could use a lot more of you here I can tell you that\nAnd again it it I called it the phenomenon of the end subordinate subordinates um during President Trump's first year in office or H R McMaster as I mentioned Dina pals old boss of was a prime example of this and and you know I think it was talking about this before but just right off of\nThe day he joined the national Security Council he announced his staff that he did not approve of the use of the term radical Islamic terrorism\nWhich you may remember was something the president actually said repeatedly and kind of pain for office on as a platform of what was going to be different about his administration from Obama's it it was just one\nEarly indication that he was a bad choice and a mistake and I'm so grateful that he's gone and uh so appreciative that John Bolton was selected as his replacement who ... who has a lot lately either I think\nThe phenomenon of the subordinate subordinates um during President Trump's first year in office or H R McMaster as I mentioned Dina towels old boss of was a prime example of this and and you know what it was talking about this before but just right off the ...\nThe day he joined the national Security Council he announced his staff that he did not approve of the use of the term radical Islamic terrorism\nWhich you may remember was something the president actually said repeatedly and ... pain for office on as a platform of what was going to be different about his administration from Obama's\nIt it was just one early indication that he was a bad choice and a mistake and I'm so grateful that he's gone and so pretty sure that John ... was selected as his replacement who ... who has a lot lately lighter I think ambassador\nBolton is the best and frankly Frank\nI'm Talking to Frank Gabby from the center for security policy I think it'd be the height of dishonesty to walk in and tell an employer I'm going to go to work for you and not say by the way ms present your entirely wrong about radical Islamic terrorism and I plan to say so\nWhat professor I'll be like one of your worst students and I'll push back on some of these things that you you say she's belligerent toward the Palestinians are these are folks who take hundreds of millions of dollars from America they don't really negotiate and they still\nWill not accept the rights of the people who live right next to them to exist and continue to exist you would be like having a neighbor who says on a regular basis Lars\nI'm planning that you're going to die soon uh it'd be tough to negotiate with somebody like that shouldn't we push back against that kind of thing and even be a little bit belligerent since all the you know warm fuzzy talk of the last Thirty years hasn't really brought the Palestinians anywhere even when Arafat was offered a of\nA Ninety eight percent of what he wanted he said no he wants to the Jews are and how do we like them\nI think it's a little bit more like a if your neighbor you were living in your neighbor's backyard if that are going to give it back and then she used to despite it'd be U.S foreign policy that you ought to\nUh so uh the Palestinians are far from perfect uh and I agree with you it Arafat that made a mistake in those negotiations but uh I think it's the Netanyahu government that is refusing to go she ate now are not Palestinians or is that the is a little obstacle to peace there but I mean that you know that issue\nOr is it in a hardly the most important one little or evaluating Haley I think ah her her policies are statements on North Korea Syria which really seems to want us to try to overthrow aside\nOr which I think would bring a a messy chaos and tried it and Iran are or where the biggest problems where\nYou know it's funny that you mentioned getting us into another war as I recall Brock Obama ran as the anti war president and he ended up with\nGive it back and then she used to despite it'd be U.S foreign policy that you ought to\nUh so uh the Palestinians are far from perfect uh and I agree with you it Arafat that made a mistake in those negotiations but uh I think it's the Netanyahu government that has refused to go shape now are not Palestinians or is that the is a real obstacle to peace there but I mean that you know that issue\nOr is it is a hardly the most important one little or evaluating Haley I think ah her her policies are her statements on North Korea Syria which really seems to want us to try to overthrow aside\nOr which I think would bring a a messy chaos and tried it and Iran are or where the biggest problems where\nYou know it's funny that you mentioned getting us into another war as I recall Brock Obama ran as the anti war president and he ended up putting troops into Syria without telling the public for a long long time you ended up putting troops a number of places you didn't get that well he got them all the way out of Iraq\nAnd then ended up putting about six or eight thousand back into Iraq because pulling out a while you know it it wasn't advised by a lot of the generals was what he did and then we ended up having to put troops ride back in there and and yet the constant drumbeat I heard before Trump was elected and after he was like is\nThis guy is going to get us into a war it seems to me that the previous president Brock Obama got us into more conflicts or put people in harm's way and more conflicts than this president has and this president is actually figured out how to get North Korea at least to come to the table\nAnd he's and he's taking a hard line with the Iranians which one is the more pro war President Trump or Obama\nI I'm not sure I I certainly wouldn't grants or almost all this all this doesn't that Obama did I Wish\nObama had it's a continued a lot of the war is the inherited her bed at the war in Afghanistan or got enough more deeply involved in Syria or helped overthrow the government of Libya I\nOppose all those things have thought they were mistakes uh I think uh the Trump Administration has continued almost every or will they actually if you could get every war they inherited a and I think they deserve some credit for for\nPursuing diplomacy with North Korea or by uh they bend a across the board I think a fairly illiterate but the main thing is that you know we we have a bipartisan consensus\nIn this country a left and right as much as they throw rocks at each other and Becker tend to agree and all these things but I just said\nDemonstrates that so I disagree with both\nSides in both parties president when they ah advocate wars that I think her needless\nDo you think that sometimes talking in a bit in a belligerent tone to people who've decided to be problematic in one way or another is sometimes the best way to keep them from going too far rather than try to you know the nice warm fuzzy approach to them 'cause that never seems to work\nWell we we do try the nice warm fuzzy approach a at time certainly uh the Trump Administration does the certain countries\nA Saudi Arabia for example are that are problematic uh I think a\nThird of course there are times people littering the threatening ah but I the the example that I mentioned doesn't bass her Haley doing it I thought were mistaken\nA week she threatened for example uh she said it was U.S policy that we would bomb the north Koreans if they had an ICBM then he cuts in ICBM that we can bomb them so I think you know if you're going to make threats they should the ones that you're prepared to act on in that case I think she was freelancing and not a following any sort of\nBroader policy that have been articulated and I think that that sort of empty plaster is is bad for us credibility and our reputation\nActually agree with you there as for the Israelis living in the backyard of the Palestinians professor one last thing in the last forty second\nUh the ministry she does the certain countries\nA Saudi Arabia for example uh that are problematic uh I think a third of course there are times the village are threatening a but the the example that I mentioned doesn't Vassar Haley doing it I thought were mistaken\nA week she threatened for example uh she said it was U.S policy that we would bomb the north Koreans if they had an ICBM then they test in ICBM that we can bomb them so I think you know if you're going to make threats they should the ones that you're prepared to act on in that case it was freelancing and not a\nFollow any sort of broader policy that if it articulated and I think that that sort of empty lobster is is bad for us credibility and a reputation\nActually agree with you there as for the Israelis living in the backyard of the Palestinians professor one last thing in the last forty seconds when countries go to war on this planet isn't it generally the case that when the the boundaries or ... when the hostility sees that they stay where they are until the two sides strike a peace correct\n[noise] for okay I'll like North Korea and South Korea we don't actually have an end of that war so we have this DMZ down the middle and and that's where it stays until you strike a peace the\nIsraelis that people have made war on the Israelis and they took property or in those conflicts and they hang onto it until somebody who's willing to strike a peace which they could do anytime they want\nAnd which they have vastly resisted being willing to do that kind of thing professor Friedman I've always appreciate your insight

need to put the American people to speak out on the show the hypocrisy these people what we pay them back to work with the American people call them or that that we get to criticize them

America could no longer exist the way we know we have to stop this foolish says oh we're not gonna know we're not going to have a country and so that's why we just about what we talk about\nI'm Talking to a diamond and so the Internet's in stations and I was just sharing with my audience this outrageous statement by Hillary Clinton who I guess things she's still a player or by coming out and saying we can't have civility until you give us power back so and I thought you're really going to keep up with these protests and the funny\n[laughter] I Love how you listen to it but it's a pass and

exist the way we know we have to stop this foolish says oh we're not gonna know we're not going to have a country that's so that's why we just about what we talk about\nI'm Talking to them and so the Internet's in sanctions and I was just sharing with my audience this outrageous statement by Hillary Clinton who I guess things she's still a player\nOr by coming out and saying we can't have civility until you give us power back so and I thought you're really going to keep up with these protests and the funny hats and pounding on doors and yelling at people and threatening people in restaurants and in public places until we give you power back that doesn't seem like the right way to get it\nLike a dictator that me and then they'd be like a intimidate in order to dominate you know let's go back to the Democrat Party [laughter] they didn't want to play with them all to press and the price I sometimes people just look at it\nI Want everybody and I don't even care what side of the hour on if you know like that to me about a country that's a blatant respect making people guilty and they got to figure out how to set up in it that\nI don't try to dismantle the constitution once a week when they need to read it if you don't like that you need to get out when you need a Republican and\nThen also look at what happened whenever the Democrat did have power they had it for eight years and what did they do for this country\n... unemployment rate it it was out of the the window they send jobs overseas and look at what they actually did for this country when they did have power do we want that again\nAnd Obama when he had all the way it is a staff and Obama packed you on TALK of coconut smiled nice he had to work for the latest Hollywood Hollywood with a puppet masters\nIn history

good way I Love the fact that you've done it participated in this documentary 'cause I think I've loved documentaries forever I used to make them for TV stations and you know none of mine have been as successful as I Know dummy crowds is going to be\nBut I thought it was a great way of getting a point across if you could get people with a ten second attention span to sit down and watch it\nAbsolutely no sense it's not the both the left is saying they were telling people to pay attention as far as we've been we've been banned bull by the less\nThey claim that they want this is that the Americans what if you want if you truly want the success of America's why did you come to the table for tax cuts America would have been successfully\nGuinea more money in their pockets why did you come to the table for certain things you know cut up to the table when we want to be said\nHe'll come to the table you want to take a fact that they somebody you see them out there in the streets acting up all the people out there in the streets you know back in the day it was the KKK what why now you got and people were black mathematics crazy if you don't like what's happening is going to

couple of nights I haven't had a great and I said because I've been on the road came up to Seattle heading back home tonight back to our home studios how about a great bed next month November Keenan Hi Mark Twenty years in sleeping honestly number but\nWhen you encounter a disability or multiple disability depending ah you know then that that\nWindow becomes even more narrow but companies themselves are they're really out there recruiting at such a high rate a big corporations I mean I I can talk to our career fairs and say that we ... we co host a\nRoughly a hundred and fifty of those a year all over the country we do some online these are big corporations are that are looking to recruit the highest level of talent you know from the veteran pool so they do recognize that they also recognize the value\nOf disabled veterans and what they also bring to the workforce so I think it's out there\nUh but we do struggle with the fact that the unemployed as unemployment goes down and and everybody's thrilled about where the rate is right now\nAnd that's great were behind that one hundred percent but the overwhelming majority of those that we deal with on a direct bases are are not unemployed underemployed and in some cases over employed\nWell here's the thing we hear about discrimination in the workplace all the time and yet this is one of the few places where an employer could correct\nMe if I'm wrong literally discriminate in favor an employer well I think Wal Mart did this not long ago said we're going to hire ten thousand vets\nAnd if they were effectively saying everyone else yeah we're going to hire them first that the law allows them to do that\nTo say we're going to hire vets were going to give preference to vets I Know there are a lot of government jobs that give preference to vet and then you take into account the\nFact that a veteran who's done service is likely in some cases more finish the job kind of person to begin with whether it's a man or woman and then if you factor in the Americans with Disabilities Act that says you legally\nHave to accommodate people's disabilities you think that the veteran would be in the cat Byrd's seat for getting jobs that are available that they want to pursue the careers they want to do\nAm I missing something or because you said that the surveys show that not quite two thirds more certainly more than half of all veterans are worried that when they go out in the workplace at their disabled they're going to face discrimination I Would hope they see not\nOnly employer saying we will follow the ADA and accommodate your disability but oh by the way you're a veteran we want to hire you even more than we want to hire the average applicant is that not happening\nI I think what you know with a statistic that would that comes from a survey that we had we that we had done and yeah we we were a little bit taken back by the fact that fifty seven percent of those surveyed younger veterans\nYou know fear discrimination in other words um they understand the position that they're in a ... but when they come back and they want to maybe they want to join a police force so they don't want to disclose a particular disability\nMissing something or because you said that the surveys show that not quite two thirds more certainly more than half of all veterans are worried that when they go out in the workplace that they're disabled they're going to face discrimination I Would hope they see not\nOnly employer saying we will follow the ADA and accommodate your disability but oh by the way you're a veteran we want to hire you even more than we want to hire the average applicant is that not happening\nUh I I think what you know with a statistic that would that comes from a survey that we had you know that we had done and yeah we we were a little bit taken back by the fact that fifty seven percent of those surveyed younger veterans\nYou know fear discrimination in other words um they understand the position that they're in a ... but when they come back and they want to maybe they want to join a police force so they don't want to disclose a particular disability or because I think a lot of it really comes from the stigma that\nYou know you don't do that over the years that was taboo to do that you kind of keep that thing to yourself um where in fact I Believe where we are today in society is exactly as you put it companies are seeking those individuals again because of the fact that they have\nNo disability um you know one of the things that that we particularly when we started interacting with companies on a regular daily basis\nEspecially the multitude of them at career fairs is the fact that there was so much and and still so much work to do on the education front of educating employers on what a disability is\nHowever to the point the the companies are doing everything they can and creating a a really really great opportunities for veterans\nNow we got to get the veterans to understand that hey you need to disclose that when it's proper to disclose it uh companies want to hire you because of it because there are tax incentives for them financial incentives for them to hire you\nAnd it just trying to get both of them and bridge that gap that's where that you know our our ... guide to hiring and retaining veterans with a disability is is really that we've released this month is hopefully going to help on both sides of the table with that\nSo Jeff working folks find these resources on line and and I would encourage people if you've got a veteran and your family or your circle of friends go out and say hey be looked at this thing especially if you know somebody who is an already on his dream her ... his dream job or her dream jobs they have you

to this Republican to world democracy which is the deep state in the west but also works with deep state or is over in the UN and all that you know whatever goes on over there too\nBut if it all comes down if it all is exposed if there is justice in this country what do the shrieking zombie demonic horn do next because reality and facts don't influence in these people's lives\nSo\nThat's the

the revelation that we've seen all the microchip and everything it looks to me like there's some kind of soft takeover that\nWas in place and I think Obama's going to sell everybody out to be on\nThis is an interesting point no no no no hold on let's let's let's let's let's let's pontificate on this a little bit [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] people people this is honestly so complex it's like I don't want to say the wrong thing or even the right thing here because it gets so taken out of context and I just know how that goes on ah so I'm going to try to not say the wrong thing here but [noise]\nBasically what you're saying is more accurate than you realize and you essentially had the Chinese Communist running the Democratic party trying to get Hillary and now I'm not sure if Obama was part of that ... or or as much as\nAs Hillary definitely is I think Obama had his own stuff going on and then because he became so popular to ... the Democrats had to work with Obama but and so maybe that's why Obama could turn on all of them but I I don't really know if that's the case but the point is\nAbsolutely one hundred percent Joseph it was the Chinese Communist behind the Democrats and still to this day are behind the Democrats and say what you want about Trump and his relationship with China\nIt's like this whole trade war thing now they have classes in on college campuses about Trump's trade war is unbelievable I mean this is again Chinese propaganda and then I just sit here I Know oh\nYou're going along with a false dichotomy between Jews in China it's like no you're the one obsessed with the Jews and and whatever the Zionist or doing which is fine that's out there I'm looking at what China is trying to do the communist to my country right now which I'd rather have free market\nIf you want to blame the free market on the Jews fine I prefer the free market then the Chinese Communist market [noise] but\nAnd so maybe that's why Obama could turn on all of them but I I don't really ... but the point is\nAbsolutely one hundred percent Joseph it was the Chinese Communist behind the Democrats and still to this day are behind the Democrats and say what you want about Trump and his relationship with China\nIt's like this whole trade war thing now they have classes in on college campuses about Trump's trade war is unbelievable I mean this is again Chinese propaganda and then I have to sit here I Know oh\nYou're going along with a false dichotomy between Jews in China it's like no you're the one that says with the Jews and and whatever the Zionist or doing which is fine that's out there I'm looking at what China is trying to do the communist to my country right now which I'd rather have free market\nIf you want to blame the free market on the Jews fine I prefer the free market than the Chinese Communist market\nBut just look at Hillary Clinton's private server serving on by the Chinese look at Diane Feinstein having a Chinese by underemployed for Twenty years and look at what President Trump is doing to China they say Trump has started a trade war with China okay fine so so what has been China been doing to us and then trade\nRape trade rape\nBy China and so Trump gets into office he says hey look I'll get along with the Chinese I respect the Chinese leadership I mean there are much smarter than our leadership look at how they stole our economy right out\nUnder us that's not dumb our leaders are so it turns out okay we're not going to let China do our economy anymore\nAnd we're going to have fair trade and we're going to bring manufacturing jobs back that's what we're going to do so of course China and the Democrats would do everything they can to try to stop that Joseph so so yes we've got ... seconds left here or go ahead

going to sit here and virtually single for your community says not your community let's go back to the fraud ...\nActually an emotional chair for many of us because I'm trying to hearken back to win

your even tell\n... is one of the products are ... and for people ... that that was before integration existed in this country right\nThat was the era of Jim Crow laws on segregation that resulted in economic the price of the next day we struggle to climb out at and so I was an apple don't get it done and that All right and look at all so on but I don't believe in that promise at the American dream but I don't see it happening right now for our rights and I didn't see it happen before\nShe got so what should be clear about this\nNow either ... is a total moron or she's a member of the mocking bird CIA press putting out propaganda to racially incite violence in this country first of all\nShow me any interviews or clips of Trump supporters saying you know about the Nineteen fifties when America was well what did you even talking about just pull that out of a rear end\n[noise] but but but that's beyond the point [noise] this is this is the propaganda at work if America was never great no country was ever\nThere was never any great and it's on earth if America was never great\nName another country seriously\nAnd of course they can't name another country where former slave and entire slave population in a country within fifty years can be totally independent had its own economies it's its own everything and and even coming from the market in many instances have them\nTop people and some of the biggest industries in this country says she's going to sit here and virtually single and I'm like oh America was never great for black people okay well where was it then where

again and they say well America was never great to these people who are obviously just mergers are going for white people\nNow she should she probably knows better she's a propaganda artist what is the truth folks\nShe knows when we say make America great again it has nothing to do with skin color it has nothing to do with a period of time it has to do with economic prosperity it has to do with financial independence with low taxes it has to do with not taking a\nKnee to the politically correct culture\nIt has to do with not having an entire group of people that hate this country that's what we mean when we say make America great again but either your mind is so filled with propaganda and disease and sickness and mental illness and obsession over identity politics that you can't even\nUnderstand that you can think about is your race based identity politics so it doesn't matter what you hear\nYou always turn it into something racial here's a story out and come era wears make

is the one keeping black people in chains intellectually and psychologically and she knows what she's doing\nWhen she says these white people just say make America great again because they want black

what Obama that a near record highs\nSo yeah we used a make America great again because we want economic prosperity for all Americans\nAnd it really makes me sick it really makes me sick [noise] that the Democrat\nParty still has some black people in this country so brainwashed that they really think that they have to vote Democrat the Democrats have run inner cities which has the highest population density for black people for fifty years what have they done\nTo amazing how you have people like Angela either keep complaining about how it's not fair for black people in this country well you've been electing Democrats for fifty years so what have they done for you nothing they keep you mentally enslaved they\nKeep you financially enslaved by having you on welfare state keep independent by telling you to break up with your husband so they give you a paycheck that's all Democrats Democrats want black people down Democrats want black people and sway mentally\nAnd then they

Believe that I still believe nobody likes Hillary I still believe build doesn't even like Hillary\nShow I I Do believe that the more Hillary is out there the better it is for Republicans and

Trump too much I Can't stand her and I'm so glad she didn't win I'm so glad she's not president and by the way the two biggest reasons I'm Glad she stopped president are Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh\nFundamentally that was the most important reason why I voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton I Can't stand Hilary clinton I think she's dishonest I think she's one of the most corrupt politicians in modern times\nBut Republicans and conservatives are like apoplectic today about something Hillary Clinton said in an interview she was over at a at Oxford in England she sat down with

didn't say get violent she just said we can't be simple and I would argue that Donald Trump is not a civil dude\nYeah I agree that he is rough around the edges but it does seem like that's what we

again my Paul Revere charge wake up Republicans wake up conservatives the Democrats are coming the Democrats were coming to get us out\nSo that we don't lose this November but I I I'm bringing it up again today because it is like in saying\nHow much money\nThese Democrat candidates for the house in the Senate or raising all over the country it is in St\n\nA congresswoman Kirsten Sinema Arizona she's a Democrat she's running for the United States Senate against Martha mix Sally Republican\n\nCinema raised almost seven million dollars\nOut so that we don't lose this November but I I I'm bringing it up again today because it is like insane\nHow much money\nThese Democrat candidates for the house and Senate are raising all over the country it is in St\nA congresswoman Kirsten Sinema Arizona she's a Democrat she's running for the United States Senate against Martha mix Sally Republican\n\nCinema raised almost seven million dollars in the last fundraising court third quarter of this past year she raised nearly seven million dollars\nA Democrat that's incredible\nNow look at\nThe amount of money a candidate raises\nIs also a reflection of the support out there like this is a lot of people from all over the country energized\nWhen Republicans raise a lot of money it means Republicans are energized 'cause that's you know ... again I Know we love to go after the big money and a lobbyist and the wealthy people but the vast majority of money that both Republicans and Democrats raise\nIs a small dollar fundraising people writing fifty dollar checks people writing one hundred dollar checks that's the truth\nA lot of people don't realize that but that really is most of the money that Republicans and Democrats raise it small dollar\nAnd so\nIt is a a ... it's an example of it's an indication of\nHow fired up Democrats are\nCursed in cinema raised to seven million dollars in third quarter just his third quarter alone that means there are a crap load of Democrats all over the country writing fifty dollar twenty dollar a hundred dollar a hundred and thirty dollar checks\nThat means people are fired up and angry\nWhen people are fired up and angry they write checks they knock on doors they make phone calls they talk to their friends they do a lot of things when people politically or fired up one of the things people do when they're politically fired up as they write checks and not this ... super duper big checks\nFrom the wealthy people know the fifty dollar checks the sixty eight dollar checks\nAnd I got to tell you something to rate and and Kirsten Sinema that she's not alone a damn Democrats who are run for the Senate and the house all over the country they're ... they're reporting on godly amounts of money that they're racing\nJacky Rosen Democrat candidate for the Senate in Nevada she\nRaised more than ... more than seven million dollars this last quarter a senator Tammy Baldwin Democrat Wisconsin brought in six million\nThat's

and\n\nJackie rose in democratic candidate for the Senate in Nevada she raised more than ... more than seven million dollars this last quarter a senator Tammy Baldwin Democrat Wisconsin brought in six million\n\nThat's a that is an indication to me\nOf just how fired up they are um and we're seeing a\nYou know typically you know Senate races are state wide right so they're bigger higher profile races there aren't as many senators and congressmen as house members are but we're seeing candidates for the house raising a million two or three million dollars a quarter\n\nOr ... or work who's running for the Senate down in Texas I don't think he's going to beat Ted Cruz\nHe raised a\nLike five million dollars in one night all small dollar contributions the Democrats have this thing called ac blue and it takes away for a again small dollar donors to contribute to candidates\n\nRepublicans typically raised more money than Democrats pretty much every election cycle generally the Republican raises more\nOr not this cycle\nDemocrats are raising more money this election cycle\nAnd it's not even close so I look at that\nAnd I look at the Democrats who are out there working pounding the pavement knocking on doors and making phone calls I see a lot of that all over the country and it reminds me of what we did in twenty ten\nWhen people on our side the Tea Party we were knocking on doors and making phone fault calls for candidates and we've pulled off a bunch of surprises in that twenty ten election\n\nI don't want to be surprised in four weeks I don't want to be

Believe that we should have in our arsenal of supplements is the digestive health so if you can go to it's a little bit about digestive\nOK Jen good point okay another thing that you could buy one bottle and then break it up into little\nIn your purse in your car and your work desk and you know in your home so this digestive enzymes land is extremely effective for\nEveryone okay so we have a raw abroad plants in fact in the digestive enzymes first of all that that we don't second of all we have added some ... route and some federal\nAnd some ginger okay these are really really good anti inflammatory as an anti accident alright additionally what makes this a showstopper is\nTwo hundred and fifty unit\nIs the digestive health so if you can go to it's a little bit about digestive\nOK Jen good point okay another thing that you could buy one bottle and then break it up into little packages and your person in your car and\nYour work desk and you know in your home so this digestive enzymes land is extremely effective for every one okay so we have a Raul broad plants in fact I'm a digestive enzymes first of all that that will second of all we have\nAdded some ... route and some federal and some ginger okay these are really really good anti inflammatory as an anti oxygen alright additionally what makes this a showstopper is two hundred and fifty unit of deep you can use for and for listeners\nThat don't know a deep you for it is simply put it take gluten\nDigesting in time\nOr it can be called a ... or it can be called a pro TA okay the bottom line is just remember the pie for and it's a it's the ivy that a Roman numeral ... piece for\nLosing digestive enzymes also attacks like isn't\nIt also is attacking album in any way so for anybody that may have issues with those kind of kind of common allergens or things like that but especially gluten ugly out in the ... is what the TPP for attacking\nSo most of the time\nPeople that manifesto he actors these are people that manifest um autism\nSpectrum disorder have really really low levels of natural the peace for digesting ends on quitting digest the income in their system so this is really good for somebody ... those those two are people that are are being\nSuffering from not you know what I'm saying but anybody also that may be eating something that they're going to be equipped intolerance or they have the empty chair far defect in so they really um have a low\nTolerance to toxins and stuff so digestive enzymes with is deeply for there is very very effective so that is the beauty of our digesting our our digestive health\nUm and a lot of people don't understand or know about the TTP for it but it does ... effective or yeah everyone\nWell yeah in fact Jennifer our just talking even about anybody with auto immune issues and ... and you know ... and has been a trigger for in a lot of those and a lot of people don't realize the sensitivities even that they may have to it\nAnd so I Love it that formula has that in there um that probably almost everyone should be taking\nIt pretty much everything yeah gluten free and I'm like well how do you know if you're you know go intolerant earth are sensitive and that's what the\nDiscussion was smart enough besides that good morning how are you [laughter] so it's something that I mean I talk about but um and it and I agree everybody should be taking a digestive enzyme I mean I don't care what I have a A R I\nYeah I absolutely agree because um they feel it after it's too late okay and because there's so many common allergens that are out there especially in the Americas and here in our United States we have so many common allergens that are affecting everybody daily digestion\nThat it's affecting their immune system and we know that that that the guy is Ninety\nUm that probably almost everyone\nShould be taking it pretty much everything yeah gluten free and I'm like well how do you know if you're you know ... intolerant or are sensitive and that's what the\nDiscussion was smart enough besides that good morning how are you [laughter] know right in and it's something that I mean I talk about but um and it and I agree everybody should be taking a digestive enzyme I mean I don't care what\nI have a A R I yeah I absolutely\nAgree because um they feel it after it's too late okay and because there's so many common allergens that are out there especially in the Americas and you're in our United States we have so many common allergens that are affecting everybody daily digestion\nThat it's affecting their immune system and we know that the the the gut\nIs Ninety more than Ninety percent in charge of our immune system so if we look at this vicious cycle that's happening all the time of the foods that we eat\nThat aren't clean enough that we just have to get in this anyway there aren't clean enough for our bodies the handle or to digest properly mhm we're looking at issue we're looking at a lot of discomfort we're looking at a lotta aches and pains\nThat are also going to need to inflammation like silent inflammation and assigned that information we know it's going to lead to elevated hummus is seen issue which is going to we I mean I can just go on and on and you know that\nBut oh I'm Joe I'm a citizen [laughter] I should we need to have you um\nYeah next time you come through Arizona let it snow we need to have a a lecture series at our store here and had we our customers that would be actually to have you and yeah and I love\nDoing the lectures especially on the methylation and be a ... it all ties together is this the circus and it's supposed to be the best running show on earth right [laughter]\nAnd it honestly renting\nGray otherwise it's the worst show on earth and so I Love doing the consumer electric engine you just sat in on the dinner training that we did last a couple of weeks ago in Arizona correct\nYes I did mhm yeah yeah yeah and we had a great\nInformational educational time\nAlthough yeah right out so am I what are you guys want to talk about Joe let me let me talk\nLet me just let me just clear up really quick on the ... percent if it's for the consumers ... under twenty dollars especially as a daily okay the coins and needed multiply are the ones that need to be\nAn algae and feel even minerals okay then we've got ... ... additional ... them in the right to the bottom line is red daily for people to understand is this is in a capsule it dissolves within two minutes to the whole process is to get into them because the lightning ... into the bloodstream boom want it to be utilized\nAlso common allergen free you can read an additive place and then also ... ... a multi vitamin line everything that Dr ... has created it all sit in a wrongful report card to replenish\nA multi vitamin line everything that Dr things or has created it all that and I was wrong or what you're saying oh we're looking for then it at the direction and increasing it by about ... with a ... ... ... ... need to understand yeah\nEither way it's shown to be effective um that's kind of the nice thing about it as it doesn't have a specific time\nWhere it's best taken\nOK okay something that yes if you're wanting to lose weight to lose weight so it would still be a good product maintain\nYeah absolutely because when you're boosting metabolism in a a natural way in a safe manner it's not going to go beyond you're not going to become malnourished or a lose too much weight or start you know metabolizing your muscles this is just going to balance digestion and balance your metabolism\nAnd it's going to happen over time you know we expected\nUm you know with any good probiotics people can lose weight just from the increased elimination and proper digestion\nI'm so we expected that you know slow weight loss a pound or two a month but we have some amazing testimonies I have a lady from Florida they're threatening us testimony that lost over fifty pounds and she had only been taking it six months when she told us that\nUm so that was a couple of months ago so we should be getting that testimony and\nI'm so for every individual it's going to vary you know I wouldn't say that everybody's going to lose fifty pounds in six months because there's a lot of variables you know um\nWhere you're starting point is your your genetics there's so many variables when it comes to weight loss um but this is something that can be good for everybody whether you need to lose five pounds or fifty um it's a safe approach that is going to have a lot of um extra benefits as well\nGreat when we got all that great products here so I'm or any of our listeners that want to have more information just give us a call or come on by now Justin on tell us a little bit also about the tri ... and Dan yeah so this is in the red Sox I call right\nSo the reason we came out with the advance care is because we had a lot of people using our original attracted by objects um that had more severe signs of 'em got ... and the bad bacteria over growth\nSo this was the most aggressive approach to correct that and to proliferate good bacteria I'm In the strongest manner that you could take you know that you couldn't have happened from one pill a day I'm so we use the sixteen strain blend of micro encapsulated probiotics I'm with a full\nBalance of this bacterium and lactobacillus strains um we've had just great testimonies with this\nColor come on by now Justin on tell us a little bit also about the tri active ... and then yeah so this is in the red box I call right\nSo the reason we came out with the advance care is because we have a lot of people using our original attractive ... um that had more severe signs of 'em got despite all this and the bad bacteria over grow\nSo this was the most aggressive approach to correct that and to proliferate good bacteria I'm In the strongest manner that you could take you know that you can have happened from one pill a day I'm so we use the sixteenth strained blend of micro encapsulated probiotics I'm with a full\nBalance of visceral bacterium and lactobacillus strains um we've had just great testimonies with this product and the nice thing is those customers who are taking the original to try to correct those symptoms and taking more pills\nUm they were up to taken three pills a day as recommended by their\nUm nutrition ... pass a doctor and that was costing upwards of a hundred dollars a month to be on that formula and take that stronger dosage but with the advance care are retail price was able to be said at just a forty nine Ninety five and I believe it healthy habit you guys have a a\nPretty big discount on those in my right\nYes we are such that we have it at thirty nine Ninety five oh awesome\nOkay so twenty percent off um that's a great price point and uh you know again it's just one pill a day and uh that's something we focus on as well as trying to make it a convenient dose that everyone will remember to take as recommended\nCan you know you had mentioned when you're talking that he or she lets them about what that means\nYes I'm good question to the microphone cap solution I talk about it so much sometimes I forget that there's people that don't understand what that means I'm this is a really cool technology it's patented technology that comes from a company called pro by article out of Italy\nAnd they have this zero gravity machine that the strains were actually suspended and then a\nA vegetable glycerin always sprayed around them to create and uncaring coating around the strains himself\nUm so the material comes to us in a powder form but it's actually the strains with individual coating around the strain so that they can get through the um harmful area of the stomach harmful to probiotics um which is the stomach acid\nRight so um tell me a little bit about\nWho should recommend this product who you know because we have so many customers coming in and they all I I Swear jumping have got issues so right yeah so which one should I recommend the advance scare over like just the other one which is just you're\nAt a at brigade um the green bought something\n[laughter] right right the green box that's okay to call them that a lot of people who have so the green boxes the original formula um and\nThat is the best one for the average person 'cause really everybody should be on a good probiotic nowadays especially\nUm you know with the influx of antibiotics in our food and so many\nConditions that um caused detriment to the good bacteria even you know take in and said I'm On a semi regular basis has actually been shown to kill off the good bacteria in your gut\nSo the green one is the ... the a recommended for the average person and anyone who has severe signs of can veto over growth or um\nOver like just the other one which is just year and a every day on the green bought something\n[laughter] right right the green box that's okay to call them that a lot of people here so the green boxes the original formula um and\nThat is the best one for the average person because really everybody should be on a good probiotic nowadays especially\nUm you know with the influx of antibiotics in our food and so many\nConditions that um caused detriment to the good bacteria even you know taking and said I'm On a semi regular basis has actually been shown to kill off the good bacteria in your gut\nSo the green one is the ... the ah recommended for the average person and anyone who has severe signs of\nCan veto over growth or um ... syndrome those are the are the people that we usually recommend the advance care for 'em a lot of people don't always attribute the symptoms that they're getting to a bad bacteria over growth because\nIt doesn't seem like it's coming from your stomach you know chronic fatigue fibromyalgia um eczema psoriasis these are all conditions that can stem from bad bacteria over growth\nAnd once the bad bacteria become prominent and make those holes in the they actually grow roots through the intestinal walls um that's what causes that they're leaking those inflammatory triggers and toxins into our bloodstream which can then affect major organs so\nFor those people with um auto auto immune conditions and things like that that could have developed from\nGod this bias is um that's definitely who we would recommend to be on the advance care and once once those symptoms have subsided um the advance care is something that you can actually stepped down from one of the lesser strength formulas\nUm they're after but some people decided they want to stay on that one which is perfectly safe as well\nAnd um I I really like it can your shelf stable you can um they're just a little ... so everybody just needs to punch one now and then you take it immediately one two punch it out\nIn the air gets at it so it's really great travel with and it's great to not forget to take your a probiotic Kansas right there with the rest of your supplement so thank you so much for coming up with that that shelf stable product\nYeah we're always looking for unique technologies you know right when we started the company and we had the the dissolving film the edible film strips with the beat twelve strips\nAnd we haven't stopped looking for unique technologies that have a higher level of benefit and we've been able to apply those in categories that really had been needed so it's been really rewarding for that reason\nRight and I'm a little bit

organic farm out of Colorado that has a patented process of removing the trace amount of ... see that's in all of these products um\nSo the industrial standard for him as set by the uh twenty fourteen farm bill um is actually three tenths of a percent so most of the um products in the category operate right around that um that kind of barrier that they're not supposed to go over\nOurs however has this process applied to it that gets it down about sixty times lower than that um and that's really important for us because we wanted to create a product that didn't have that um residual build up of the psychoactive component so\nOr hemp extract um is a full spectrum and are more common a product that is sold and the one that people seem to gravitate towards is the temperament flavor um but it also comes in a natural flavor which is safe for pets as well as humans\nI'm One of the unique things about our product as well as the carrier oil that we have is great see oil\nHow the house call

front of me but sometimes my head\nGo don't do it go somewhere else anyway that was my\nMy morning monologue this morning about what you should do it yourself if you're paying less than if you are expanding any time leisure time that's more than an hour a day\nThen a good recommendation would be to take at least another hour a day to pay attention to our finances in a crazy yeah we'll put our money and somebody's hands and not pay attention to it at all\n\nMake sense and that's what my dad taught me and my mother more than my father she said you got to pay attention to what you have kept your pennies don't do those pennies away are you crazy you can't be changed ... pennies anyway there's a lot going on in the bitcoin world it's been hovering at sixty five fifty nine\n... monologue this morning about what you should do it yourself if you're paying listen if you are expanding any time leisure time that's more than an hour a day\nThan a good recommendation would be to take at least another hour a day to pay attention to our finances isn't it crazy how will put our money and somebody's hands and not pay attention to it at all\n\nThat make sense and that's what my dad taught me my mother more than my father\nShe said you got to pay attention to what you have kept your pennies don't do those pennies away are you crazy you can't be changed you can't pennies anyway there's a lot going on in the bitcoin world it's been hovering at sixty five fifty nine\nThis morning that the price right now sixty five fifty nine has been ultimate prize for about four weeks now and I've been saying hey we're fixing to make a purchase today\nI've been saying all along hey something's gonna happen here it's either going to take it there wouldn't be nothing wrong with that or it's going to take a bump\nWhen uh usually when it hovers like this sickening I mean there's been a month there's been one of the longest sustaining\nPrice ranges that at that sixty five hundred level for a while I mean the big ones had in a couple of years normally moves ten twenty percent of day man that's a day trader dream but the Dallas Morning took a three hundred and sixty born drop\nNow the doubt it mirrors ... you know the stock market here mirrors the charts from Nineteen twenty nine back in the day remember when they had the big depression so looking at the charts as I went back and started looking at the charts now I'm\nI I'm a big picture guy looked at the big picture especially with crypto currency I look back in the hat mood and I look at the charts and then I make my decisions on what I Want to do and what I'm believing in the people that are buying ... by so I'm okay and then I gave my strategies\nI got people that says I don't want to know I don't care\nThat is what do you do you buy it\nWhatever you'd take care of it and I'm trusting yeah I don't I don't need to know I said well you do need to know that's the thing and then after because you've given me something you know some money to buy for you now it's time for you to open your own wallet separate from what I'm doing\nNeed to learn how to trade your self pay attention to your own money and we'll start with something small like two or three hundred or a couple of thousand let's do that and then you learn how to trade I showed a young man the other day I've been working with them for a couple of days on his trading\nHe's got a lot of money that away young then as early twenties\nAnd he's not paying attention to his money I said okay so he asked me about it and I said listen\nI'm I'm not trading for yet you're trading yourself but let's do this I'm going to give you some recommendations based on what I Would do your morning Mario my brother's talking to me on the Internet here\nI'm I'm gonna give me some recommendations a more what I Do what I Would do and so he started trading he goes oh my gosh she made thirty eight hundred dollars in one day thirty eight hundred\nThirty eight hundred and one day I had to pull the trigger he didn't think he could do it I said it's so simple by it right now so he bought some\nAnd then it went up a little bit as to go ahead and this is what I Would do because you already have your a reserve over here go ahead and sell it and take your day money ain't salad I said yeah salad oh he was so I just sell it that simple so he sold it and then we did another one\nI'm going to give you some recommendations based on what I Would do your morning Mario my brother's talking to me on the Internet here\nI'm I'm gonna give me some recommendations a more what I Do what I Would do and so he started trading he goes oh my gosh you make thirty eight hundred dollars in one day thirty eight hundred\nThirty eight hundred and one day as it pull the trigger he didn't think he could do it I said it's so simple by it right now so he bought some\nAnd then it went up a little bit I said go ahead and this is what I Would do because you already have your a reserve over here go ahead and sell it and take your day money ain't salad I said yeah salad oh he was so now I just sell it that simple so he sold it\nAnd then we did another one later in the afternoon that I Walk them through his money and wanted to do it\nAsked me so I told him at the end of the day the next morning eight a day when we were talking late at night one in the morning he says you know what I make thirty eight hundred today do the math on that\nThirty eight hundred dollars hey let's say and you're paying attention to your own finances thirty eight hundred dollars let's say you only do that once a week for the Next Fifty two weeks\nHe made himself you wouldn't make yourself an extra one hundred and Ninety seven thousand dollars\nOne Ninety seven six hundred to be exact you're going to have some times in there we'll make so much but when you're playing now here's a guy who has half a million dollars plus so I decided to take a small amount\nAnd move it over and the crypto and play with it but it's been sitting there he's terrified to pull the trigger I\nSaid it's real simple or is it how long did it take you to buy the crypto the first time he bought a tip seconds but it took them a little bit in the beginning but now he's already he's uh forty grandfather Dan so it just that you know he's got an account he's got credit cetera you have to build is your leverage himself\nAnd that happens within seconds he buys a band within seconds it's done he sells it puts it out there it within seconds it's done\nThey're just nervous about making paying attention to his own money hundred Ninety thousand dollars a year I don't know anybody who couldn't use an extra hundred Ninety thousand dollars a year\nEven if you made yourself an extra five hundred dollars a week that's an extra two thousand dollars a month an extra twenty four thousand a year\nThat's nothing to laugh about that's not crumbs good thing about what our president's doing anyway I'm gonna get back to the story is on the U.S policies here so I'm looking at the twenty seven to thirty six charts\nBack in the stock market days of the crash when the stock market crash the great depression\nAnd the fans and the interest rates you know they've always been a wrong in regards the Federal Reserve has always been wrong they've never been right ever ... they're not right there ... they always try to get ahead of it or try to get ahead of the curve\nBut what they always do because they raise the interest rates and they're not they don't understand they're trying to cause not so much inflation but when you have a train running you don't want to get in front of the train\nIt every single time is what the Federal Reserve has done for decades their approach is that right I think Trump President Trump has got a different strategy will we know he does\nYou know a point of the new Federal Reserve guy in the uh Jerome Powell who took the head of the Federal Reserve he's the chairman\nAnd the fans and the interest rates you know they've always been a wrong\nIn regards the Federal Reserve has always been wrong they've never been right ever they they're not right there ... they always try to get ahead of it or try to get ahead of the curve\nBut what they always do because they raise the interest rates and they're not they don't understand they're trying to cause not so much inflation but when you have the train running you don't want to get in front of the train\nIt the rails it every single time is what the Federal Reserve has done for decades their approach is that right I think Trump President Trump has got a different strategy will we know he does\nYou know he pointed to a new Federal Reserve guy in the uh Jerome Powell who took the head of the Federal Reserve\nHe's the chairman of the fed a Federal Reserve they've got different and so different ideas now than what they had before that in the last couple of years it really has been no interest you're there\nIt's not going up so it's like you had to be careful of trying to get ahead of that in\nControlling the economy here's what most people don't know you can't buy and sell you can't compete against the institutional buyers and here's why it's important to pay attention to your own money because you have the institutional buyers do you have the institutional sellers which you cannot compete against\nNow traditionally over the last one hundred years about two percent of America and it's always stuck to that number why I had no idea\nBut that's it about two percent of Americans and and that number stayed steady for decades buy into the stock market the other Ninety eight percent they've got other ideas of how they want to invest\nSo out of that two percent they own Ninety eight percent of America here's another stab\nOne percent of that two percent one percent of that two percent owns fifty percent of America so what does that tell you a very small majority owns half of what goes on you cannot compete I cannot compete against institutional buyers and sellers\nWhat does that matter to you why is that important to you well over here in the crypto world you can compete with anybody on the exchanges that's the great thing about it some of the exchanges are starting to get really good\nWhere they are putting money I'm Talking tens of millions of dollars hundreds of millions now hopefully into their cyber security\nOf those exchanges so people don't hack because their\nTrust me when I say this hackers are coming at these exchanges by the hundreds and thousands every day\nA lot of money gets lost you had to really pay attention to what's going on with your wallet with your money on those exchanges you got to pay attention okay what you're\nWhat you're doing on a daily basis it's important to do that so now there's some exchanges that are really starting to work we're going to have you made some money your money's going to be insured we're going to\nBack it OK FDIC insured for any cash\nBecause the partners that I'm working with are heavily they were in capital by cell bonded before but now we're partnering with people who got big money we're talking billions of dollars\nAnd they they're that kind of capital can always ensure your money okay but it's coming for crypto I'm telling you that now you want to get ahead of the car so what does all this has to do most other countries\nChanges that are really starting to work we're going to have you made the money your money's going to be insured we're going to back it OK FDIC insured for any cash\nAnd because the partners that I'm working with are heavily ... ... ... ... capital ... bonded before but now we're partnering with people who got big money we're talking billions of dollars\nAnd they ... that kind of capital can always ensure your money okay but it's calming for crypto I'm telling you that now you want to get ahead of the car so what what does all this has to do most other countries\nSo the beginning potential value this ...\nIs\nOne million for that bitcoin if you own a bitcoin I recommend you hold the eighty percent of the people when they took the debt from Nineteen thousand now down to sixty five hundred eighty percent of never solved they hold onto smart guys and gals the average Joe and the average and you're holding on smart people okay\nSo there's one hundreds of tells you bet\nOne hundred million ... for bitcoin the next potential past one million is one hundred million but here's the thing\nBreaks down from there you don't have to print more it doesn't cost more there's not a debt to go out to be sold which caused the inflation\n\nWhat happens is if you divide it out when it becomes harder to get\nIn harder to mine every four years it's going to increase the value tremendously where you can buy into it because they get fraction now\nCould you imagine one bitcoin can be the value of one trillion dollars one bitcoin can be the value of one trillion dollars\nOne bitcoin can be the value of one trillion dollars we only need three hundred bitcoin rates one trillion three fraction doubt in order to be the world economy there's Seventeen million of them out there right now it's going to be the biggest\nShift in wealth in human history the biggest shift you can reach us up for a zero for six six zero nine six Google refuses to assist US military bends over for China communist sensors and here's what's crazy the block Jane and being\nDecentralized and companies that are doing social mania we're we're building one now matter of fact I talked to a group of guys and gals last night who are working on a new type Twitter can you imagine that there's a lot of companies out there working on it\nCoin can be the value of one trillion dollars we only need three hundred bitcoin rates one trillion to be fraction doubt\nIn order to be the world economy there's Seventeen million of them out there right now it's going to be the biggest shift in wealth in human history the biggest shift\nYou can reach us up for a zero for six six one zero nine six Google refuses to assist US military bends over for China communist sensors and here's what's crazy the block Jane\nAnd being decentralized and companies that are doing social mania we're we're building one now matter of fact I talked to a group of\nGuys and gals last night who are working on a new type Twitter can you imagine that there's a lot of companies out there working on um right now\nWhen the block Shane gets out there where it's being used everyday crypt those being used everyday people are verifying everyday using the block chain what's gonna happen is there's gonna be companies out there there's already one out there\nThat's getting some steam called steam it getting some stain [laughter]\nMoving along where they have a decentralized platform where you can put on your videos ... et cetera imagine that if you're a guy or gal out there if you got a company that's trying to monetize your business online\nAnd YouTube is Dee monetize then Google is democratizing\nWhat you're doing which means if you're by the way if you're conservative they are de monetize which means they're not going to allow you to make money\nYou have to do a lot of money at it to make money there's not shouldn't be that way because how did those\nPlatforms make money they make it not from you they make it from advertising dollars doesn't make sense that the advertising dollars should go to the shows like mine out there or yours\nNot the exchanges not the platforms why should the platforms make like YouTube make half a billion dollars a year in profits and people that put on after good content make paintings\nIt shouldn't be the other way around and then everyone should have their say and be able to get it out there not just one side all sides should be able to get it out\nOkay that's what's coming to Google changed his famous motto don't be evil to something like don't be evil when it's convenient but it's okay to be even when it means that new markets\nMore profits are there the question is partly because the intercept has reported that Google plans to launch a censored version of its search engine in China and the next year painting the approval of Chinese regulators isn't that crazy\nChina already has one of the world's worst

the trade is brought you buy online training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education [noise]\nAre people with the show for a while know a lot of time to talk about the ban statistics that we're constantly being fat and I talk a lot about you know kind of why they do this which is the entire market and the entire economy is built on debt\nAnd debt is confidence when people are confident they loan money when people are confident they borrow money when they're not confident neither of those things happen the whole thing Brian ... Holt markets crash it's ugly the people in in power get blamed the ... come out and it's just not a good time for the body\nSo they constantly are giving the stance that have no real basis in reality\nAnd you kind of say well but you know if that's what kind of keeps this whole thing going you know why do I care well the reason that you should care is because it allows people if they believe the numbers and not just allows them actually kind of direct them to making bad decisions\nSo for example last friday we had the jobless numbers come out and people talked about how well you know yeah we didn't create as many jobs as we expected but when you look at the raw provisions for the month before it was still look\nPeople are confident they loan money when people are confident they borrow money when\nThey're not confident neither of those things happened the whole thing Brian ... Holt markets crashed it's ugly the people in in power get blamed ... come out and it's just not a good time for anybody so they constantly are given that the stance that have no real basis in reality\nAnd you kind of say well but you know if that's what kind of keeps this whole thing going you know why do I care well the reason that you should care is because it allows people if they believe the numbers and not just allows them actually kind of direct them to making bad decisions\nSo for example last friday we had the jobless numbers come out and people talks about how well you know yeah we didn't create as many jobs as we expected but when you look at the raw provisions for the month before it was still okay and now we have the lowest unemployment rate that we've had in this country for fifty years\nBack to Nineteen sixty nine or whatever it was\nWell the thing is that true okay and we're going to get into why it's not true but what it means is that when people hear that and they think holy cow the economy is firing on all cylinders\nTherefore I'm going to put more money at risk and the stock market they're buying in it the wrong time the key to making money at anything in life is buying low and selling hot\nBuying stocks at the all time high of the market is unlikely to yield the returns that people are expecting and that's the thing stocks are incredibly expensive right now it doesn't matter what metric you want to look at stocks are basically they've been may be more expensive once or twice in all of us history\nSo you say well why would I buy them now\nWe will stipulate that number as it were okay well if you then look at how much that the world has it's generally somewhere around I think three to three and a half times that number so whatever it is it's three and a half times more is what the total debt is\nSo it's in the three hundred kind of trillion dollar range three to three fifty so\nYou'd sit there and say okay you have on the debt out there what's going to keep this thing going if people stop borrowing money and they start paying back the money they do well in fact nothing okay because the only reason there's been anything that looks like growth pretty much anywhere is the fact that people are borrowing huge sums of money\nI mean the United states last year\nFor and actually for the last couple of decades\nFor us to be able to grow the economy a dollar we have to borrow about three dollars so again as long as there is confidence and people are willing to borrow and people are willing to lend we can continue to get some\nHow much that the world has it's generally somewhere around I think three to three and a half times that number or whatever it is it's three and a half times more as what the total debt is so it's in the three hundred kind of trillion dollar range three to three fifty so\nYou'd sit there and say okay you have all this debt out there what's going to keep this thing growing your people stop borrowing money and they start paying back the money they do well in fact nothing\nBecause the only reason there's been anything that looks like growth pretty much anywhere is the fact that people are borrowing huge sums of money I mean the United states last year for actually for the last couple of decades\nFor us to be able to grow the economy a dollar we have to borrow about three dollars so again as long as there is confidence and people are willing to borrow and people are willing to lend we can continue to get something that kind of looks like gross\nBut besides the feds issues which I'm going to get into it swam so concerned about the election this fall again not a political statement you can think Trump is the devil and you can think he's got on earth it makes no difference to me okay I Do not have a dog in that fight\nBut if the Democrats take the house and I don't know that they will or will not and again don't have a dog in the fight one way or another I'm going to tell you that is not going to be good for market confidence because if you think the last couple of weeks with Brett Kavanaugh were kind of vicious\nWeighty what happens when when ... when Donald Trump is center stage okay\nBecause I I don't know I Would guess that if you went back thirty six years into Trump's [laughter] you might find something slightly unsavory um that or at least that you can construed as a way\nAnd and again you may think that all that stuff should come out and you may think it should all be forgotten in the past and you may have blind faith that he's telling the truth and blind faith that no matter what he does he's a liar\nAgain it makes no difference\nIs it going to be good for the country's confidence confidence in our economy has confidence in our market if it is two years of sheer division well every piece of this man's life has investigated and not just his life\nEvery person who knows Brett Kavanaugh's probably not out of the woods yet and again you may think this is all great and what should happen and it's divine justice that's all fine but I understand it's going to have a tremendous impact on business\nAnd to be Frank if I'm the party out of power I'm not sure I'm Upset by that\nBecause if you crash this economy you will romp in the next election you will take every lover of power that's out there now again I Am not attributing that as a motive to anybody do not misunderstand but they've had worse things happen to them\nAnd you know don't throw me into that briar patch as it were so I look at this and say what is it a can a road confidence one of them is money getting more expensive\nToo is obviously the market starting to go down housing that's been slowing and many of the larger cities I was actually we had a student and the other day it's been a mortgage broker for going on Thirty years\nAnd his statement ... flat out was the recession is already started he said I've been through this movie before he said there's two big brokers kinda\nNationally that he mentioned don't remember the names offhand but both of them of laid off you know around two hundred people like one of them last friday laid off a hundred and eighty people the other one was like two hundred and fifty\nAnd he said these are the things that you see happening when housing is basically grinding to a halt\nNow can they do things can they go to lunch money down to the keep this thing go and maybe for a little while sure but at some point we know this all has to stop and when it stops is going to be really really ugly and again if I'm the party out of power\nObviously the markets starting to go down housing has been slowing and many of the larger cities I was actually we had a student and the other day it's been a mortgage broker for going on Thirty years\nAnd his statement ... flat out was recessions already started he said I've been through this movie before he says there's two big brokers kinda nationally that he mentioned don't remember the names offhand but both of them I was laid off you know around two hundred people like one of them last friday laid off a hundred and eighty people the other one was like two hundred and fifty\nAnd you said these are the things that you see happening when housing is basically grinding to a halt\nNow can they do things can they go to lunch money down because they keep this thing go and maybe for a little while sure but at some point we know this all has to stop\nAnd when it stops is going to be really really ugly and again if I'm the party out of power or even the party in power and I'm not in love with the policies of this president it'd be really nice to be able to blame all this stuff on him when it went south\nAnd and as I've often said\nWe give way too much credit to presidents for things when they look like they're going well we give way too much blame when things aren't going well because at the end of the day the president can only do so much\nNow but it doesn't matter it's all the perception and so if we can hang a whole bunch of stuff on you know where the other the other party is in power then that's going to be good for us so when I look at that\nI see a couple of different scenarios I mean most people believe that the Republicans will hold the Senate again maybe they will maybe they didn't want I have no real insight into this but actually read some analysis today that kind of was here's the four scenarios of what could happen and one of the scenarios was Democrats take the house don't take the Senate\nAnd it was well you know Trump just ... a lot of his way and you know whatever and we kinda muddle through auto no no no I don't think that's one of the choices again I think it's two years of investigation I think is two years of division\nThe likes of which we haven't seen and again people can blame either side that's not the point\nBut are you prepared for that financially are you prepared for that if all of a sudden there's a recession how safe is your job\nOkay we always think about well this is what I'm doing the market goes down and and I had a guy in them black class at a fair amount of money and you know what's your strategy when the market goes down 'cause none of it's protected right now\nAnd the strategy was well outsell was the question is at what point how much are you willing to lose before yourself and then to who because everyone had to shoot to sell right so we need to have a better strategy from the for them that\nSo again in the class when I'm trying to teach you guys is here's how you can be prepared here's the signs look for that the markets in trouble then it's here's how you do not just survive it how do you actually make money when it goes down and\nHow do you continue to make money if it keeps going up because we can do that too so if you want to come up to class you can get to free tickets enter free tablet when you come out the number to call is\nEighty four forty

Jersey that's what we do okay\nWe just make up how many businesses we think just started up this month and how many people they employed and then it will it and argue about it in a country of three hundred and twenty million people we argue about whether this five thousand or ten thousand fewer are more jobs\nAnd it's the insanity that's leading people to make bad decisions in their own portfolios\nAnd making bad decisions in Washington\nThe Federal Reserve has screw this up big time and they've got a difficult job\nBecause they screwed up so big\nGuy but now what they're doing is not just raising rates it's the quantitative tightening that is where the real danger to the market comes in of the kind of known there's among an unknown unknowns out there that could hurt this market\nBut that's the biggest no no and again we're closer to the end of this than the beginning to come back to that thought but for those if you're just joining a\nNew class I'm going to be teaching on this is before the crash profit and protection strategies for any market the idea is\nThat if you think about how does Goldman Sachs how to Warren Buffett how did these people really make money in the market they\nBuy loans so high they don't buy stuff and hold onto it forever they don't buy stuff and hope it goes up they buy stuff and they make it go up so you think about Warren Buffett\nThe first quarter of this year he bought Seventy five million shares of apple now did he bomb all at once no he's got the money to do it he has a hundred billion dollars he doesn't know what to do with it but didn't buy 'em all in one day why\nBecause Warren Buffett pays attention to price Warren Buffet bought those shares best I can tell for a hundred and fifty to a hundred and fifty five dollars a share\nNow after we bought him he told you that he bought him why did he tell you that because he knows that you'll look at and go well Warren Buffett smart guy if you buy an apple I want to buy apple\nAnd he told you and it was about a hundred and sixty five and from there to stock when I'm a straight up to two hundred and twenty five he's up fifty percent in his apple trade already okay because the retail\nThey don't buy stuff and hold onto it forever they don't buy stuff and hope it goes up they buy stuff and they make it go up so you think about Warren Buffett\nThe first quarter of this year he bought Seventy five million shares of apple now did he bomb all at once no he's got the money to do what he has a hundred billion dollars you know what to do with it but didn't buy 'em all in one day why\nBecause Warren Buffett pays attention to price Warren Buffett bought those shares best I can tell for a hundred and fifty to a hundred and fifty five dollars a share now after we bought him he told you that he bought him why do you tell you that\nBecause he knows that you'll look and go well Warren Buffett's a smart guy if he's buying apple I want to buy apple and he told you when it was about a hundred and sixty five and from there to stock when I'm a straight up to two hundred and twenty five he's up fifty percent in his apple trade already okay\nBecause the retail trade or doesn't pay attention to price they hear apple they hear Warren Buffett and they think good investment\nBut it's a good investment if you get in it the right price so in class when I'm going to show you is how do you identify the places where people like Warren Buffett are buying and selling and if you could do the same thing they were doing at the same prices\nThat's a useful piece of information and then it how do we manage our risk when we're wrong so if you want to come out and get to free tickets to be one of the next dozen callers and ate for for eight eight seven twenty three thirty seven\nOr you can test the waters O T a as an online training academy two three one nine nine sick if you win and please register will see it [noise]\nHi this is Ken and you're on the right side of the trade between the black helicopters and CNBC\nThere's the right side of the trade right side of the trade is brought you buy online training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education okay recapping very briefly the idea of today's show\nIs for a long time in the show we've talked about how the government stance just don't add up for example\nWe talk about there's GDP Growth of three or four percent however for every dollar of growth in the economy we're currently borrowing three to four dollars and have been for decades so how do we really have any growth and we don't all we're doing is taking future demand\nPulling it into the present in efficiently by the way\nAnd using it to make things look much better than they actually are\nThe next thing is is like the unemployment rate and kind of what triggered this with me is last week they come out we have three point seven percent unemployment\nOkay well then how do you explain the fact that we have three hundred and twenty million people or whatever it is in the country these days\nAnd we have Ninety five million of them not even looking for work okay and it's not older people retiring the people that are not in the labor force the people from twenty five to fifty four and that has tremendous long term ramifications so the problem with the bogus statistics and and the next point I was making is that\nThe reason they give you the bogus statistics is because if you knew the reality\nYou'd have no faith in this economy and if you don't have faith you worry about your job you worry about your investments are less likely to put money in the market you're less likely to invest in education so that you can get ahead in the future you're less likely to take on that because you know that your traumas more insecure than you think\nAnd all those kinds of things so everybody kind of benefits from you know the big lives that are sold out\nWell then how do you explain the fact that we have three hundred and twenty million people or whatever it is in the country these days\nAnd we have Ninety five million of them not even looking for work okay and it's not older people retiring the people that are not in the labor force or the people from twenty five to fifty four and that has tremendous long term ramifications so the problem

you're less likely to take on that because you know that your traumas more insecure than you think\nAnd all of those kinds of things so everybody kind of benefits from you know the big lives that are told out here and again you know just from the GDP thing\nThe country right now it's sitting on Seventy one trillion dollars in debt\nA huge part of this is the individual is borrowing money to go to college to buy houses that they can afford and to buy stocks and I haven't really gotten to this in the show but\nAbout three percent more than three percent of the entire US Economy has been borrowed so people can buy stock on what's called margin\nAnd the problem is is that when when that starts getting more expensive when interest rates go up\nPeople trucking and what are called margin called and they have to come up with more money and if people don't have any more money so when that starts happening they're forced to sell and and part of what I cover in classes I Will show you how much margin that there is I'll show you how much money these people don't have\nAn in historically what always happens in these cycles at the fed starts raising interest rates people start backing off on

that I I Can't it makes me so angry\nTo listen to that because the\nI she I think she called on Hillary Clinton to make up for the fact that\nShe wavered\nHeart attack or to make up for the fact I guess to to to some of the more\nDemocrat that she wasn't gonna she wasn't going to support Kavanaugh so I think she's trying to put some distance between her and Hillary Clinton that honestly all

...\nWell that's not the audio soundbite at all that I wanted so that wasn't at all it's go ahead and go to click on\nIt won for datas could five [noise]\nAll right moving on down the line here we are this is an absolute nightmare and listen to this\nThis is crazy a tick bite leave St Louis county woman allergic to red meat I've never heard of ... doing that's ever ever should that castle would save parts that are the palms and bottoms of her fetus like crazy so she took about a drill\nShe um that was her um she said that she after she a red meat that's what after that was that those are the

every time\nAnd that they said that anyone can develop allergies allergic to me but it's more common and people who spend a lot of time outdoors which is kind of\nBut apparently it is that it was because of a tick bite\nBecause it it it's just the craziest things that's a crazy thing I've ever heard in my life I don't even know didn't even know that that was possible that sounds like an absolute nightmare an absolute nightmare uh let's see Dwayne the rock Johnson is slammed\nBy a by people who are mad that he is he's going to be he's portraying John Henry and his upcoming Netflix films I'm John Henry is a this legendary a legendary figure and African American folklore [noise]\nHe um race to steam powered rock really machine and the Eighteen hundreds and he'd beat the machine but his heart gave out from stress and so people are mad because he's dark skinned and they are mad at joined Johnson because he's only half black one of his parents his mother is ...\nAnd his father is black and so because he's not fully black and he sliced and they are apparently people are saying racial appropriation I'm not even making us up [noise]\nCame to give me the craziest look I'm swear to you I'm not even making us up I feel like I Need a bookmark that because you're full of questions right now I can just see them yeah it's just awful ah and this is this is horrible story authorities found a hundred and twenty three missing children and one day one day\nDuring the Michigan sex trafficking operation\nOperation Michigan safe kid placement emphasis on locating missing kids who are victims of sex trafficking and they found them they located and they turned them over to child protective services for Africa ... this is the most hundred and twenty three children and one day just awful\nPart of it is well all of it it secret AI recruiting tool\nBecause it didn't like winning\nThe Amazon Amazon ended the job recording service that it was developing because it was apparently reportedly biased against women it was created by their Edinburgh team in twenty fourteen to Stuart TVs automatically and so the air I taught itself to downgrade resumes that included words words like women\nThat it's his nose at Amazon now uses it for much watered down version of the recording ended up with some rudimentary chores like removing duplicate resumes every time that they've ever done anything with the stuff\nWith that without AI it always ends horribly it always ends ... it ... all the time as the craziest thing\nYeah the wear and then last but not least ah the we're keeping a watch on hurricane Michael as it has made landfall\nThere on the Florida Panhandle will bring you any developments that we have coming up Heidi Heitkamp condemned Hillary Clinton and Democrats tried to fight the mob label stay with us [noise]\n\n\nIt is so sad it is so unbelievably sad\nI and that's Heidi Heitkamp for you pay Heitkamp ladies and gentlemen [noise]\nNow I Will say this for a hike camp we played for you or do we have those remarks really quick and we pull those up the Hillary Clinton has\nSet in the interview where she was a sense as she was an essential and she was saying let's be on civil she was telling people to be on civil with each other\nShe was telling them and of course remember this is after I Wish I think it's incredibly are responsible for Hillary Clinton to have said this because we're talking about a time in which Democrats shot up a congressional baseball field attack Senator Rand Paul in his yard sent powder and other things\nTo a Republican senator and other lawmakers offices of threatened the children of a number of Republican lawmakers ah docks Republican senators threatened to put the medical records of Republican senators children on line can I go on\nThis was a time when people who are on the left have been protesting by burning down buildings and punching people in the head and engaging in property destruction and Hillary Clinton says that\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about\nThat's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the how to end or the Senate\nThat twin civility can start again\nSo she's saying civility we can't have civility until we have power that's what she said we talked about her comments a little bit yesterday but I have more on them now she's saying that we cannot be civil until we have power we're not going to be civil to you we're not going to be civil period until\nWe have power bottom line bottom line and then\nBy the way she's not on the same page as the media who is coordinating a massive push back against the mob narrative\n[noise] so yeah and I have more on that so Heidi Heitkamp she said that she can stand a Clinton's remarks Heitkamp\nSaid on Cooper last night I mean I Can't ... she said first off she said that it was ridiculous what she had said that what Hillary Clinton had said she said well it's ridiculous uh she said that\nAh it's that I mean I Can't imagine how you get anything done if you don't bring stability back into politics and that goes for both sides high can't win out plus how she went on to add that she hopes we can find common ground in this country et cetera et cetera\nSo that Hillary Clinton's remarks were incredibly unfortunate because this is the exact same time that Democrats now have been fighting too\nAgainst the mob narrative [noise]\nSo yeah and I have more on that so Heidi Heitkamp she\nSaid that she condemned ah Clinton's remarks Heitkamp said on Cooper last night I mean I Can't ... she said first off she said that it was ridiculous what she had said that what Hillary Clinton had said\nShe said well it's ridiculous uh she said that\nAh it's that I mean I Can't imagine how you get anything done if you don't bring civility back into politics and that goes for both sides high can't went up plus how she went on to add that she hopes we can find common ground in this country et cetera et cetera\nSo that Hillary Clinton's remarks were incredibly unfortunate because this is the exact same time that Democrats now have been fighting to ah avoid the mob tactic now do you want to know why there's this coordinated effort to push back on the narrative of the mob and it's not a narrative it's just a fact\nWould you like to know why they're doing that I Want to take you back to the president's op ed let me just take you back to this real quick I Want to take you back to the president's op ed in USA Today\nWe're in he\nDiscussed Venezuelan style socialism\nAnd he also discussed the on civil way\nThat Democrats have been um\nHaving discussions on a ... everything every every policy\nOne of his course was the Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern and and he said he mentioned that again is outside but you remember that speech that he did that can you give me this audio he says the Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern but do you remember his audio he said you don't hand matches to an arsonist\nAnd you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what they've become\nHe said you don't hand matches to an arsonist and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what they've become that was the president's quote from his rally the other day that was the president's quote a Sunday night at\nRally the day that Kavanaugh was started Saturday Night the day that Kavanaugh was a finally confirmed listen\n[noise]\nAnd those are doing and we left wing mom [noise] yeah you have\nCNN and MSNBC and everybody falling all over themselves to go back against the ... in fact broke Baldwin over unseen it wouldn't even say the word mobs she literally said the M. F. word\nAudio is down by twenty three this system of that discussion listen\nIt's because I Believe it's the overreaction of a well when you see people like Ted Cruz getting faced out are rough cross by a mob oh You're welcome to use the word is totally of all it is without a doubt that there's no other word for it\nIt's going to\nPut a da da da da da da da da da and Charlottesville, Virginia to August ago no mom not what we saw shaved they I don't think we've right\nWhat about the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls what do you call that\nCivil procedure or about 'em up I think\nIt's a monitor what she was saying the N word earlier in the mosque it'd them up\nHave to they have to respond to this because this is the way the behavior of Democrats\nEl always works against them this is why they\nPeople like Ted Cruz getting faced out or restaurants by a mob oh You're welcome to use the word is totally about it is without a doubt that there's no other word that are is\nIt's going to put a da da da da da da da da da and Charlottesville, Virginia to August ago no mom not what we saw shaved they I don't think we've right what about the people who were at the Supreme Court\nBanging on the walls what do you call that\nCivil procedure or about 'em up I think he's a whim\nYeah it's a monitor what she was saying the N word earlier in the mosque\nIt as a mom\nHave to they have to respond to this because this is the way the behavior of Democrats\nAlways works against them this is\nWhy they lose they they they just blow through their strategy because they they fake it but they can make it because they can't fake it that long\nThe real intent always comes out the door the authoritative ... tendencies always come out to try to suppress differences of opinions are forced\nCharlottesville was a mob\nAnd you know what was the antifa on the left you know what was the Portland protests that we've been seeing you know what was the mob of people who went outside a lot of rallies and we're doing the stuff that they were doing so is that\n\nThose are mob did you see what happened on the inauguration\nAll of it was a mob\nViolence angry hateful mobs people punching people because they were a red hat people ripping hats off in people's heads at malls and restaurants et cetera et cetera people hounding other people in restaurants simply because of a difference of opinion running them down an airport attacking them in their yards\nShooting up a ball field\nViolent mob like behavior\nJust insane\nThat's the idea that they think that and remember these individuals you can't get a Democrat to even condemn antifa\nThat's a good out the vote apparatus\nSo now they want to stay well mob is it's well mob the N word I Can't even believe anybody says that with a straight face\nThe dumbest thing I've ever heard\nHis down by twenty five now here's we're seeing and tries to explain to you a mob like scenario\nCalling them a mob is that a bit much\nNo not when you see what they've been doing look uh I don't think you need to tell me that we want you need to tell those people out there that are banging on the doors of the Supreme Court and chasing dinners out of public restaurant and they only had a senators are in an elevator starts looks\nThe Republicans won they knew that that meant that the president would have the opportunity to appoint one possibly to a nominees to be confirmed on the Supreme Court and they should actually acknowledge that if they spent more time handing out voter registration forms across the country they'd be much more effective that's happened in ...\nA lot of people don't I mean all of us who doesn't mean that people don't get to object I mean that's your right and American to object\nThat show is covered in the first amendment but there's one\n... they certainly can do that but what what are you saying and and we're seeing it across the country going to a restaurant and screaming at an elected official in a public restaurant and they did the thing that they're a fan or they've done the same to ... to many members of this administration because they object with a policy\nKnew that that meant that the president would have the opportunity to appoint one possibly to a nominees to be confirmed on the Supreme Court and they should actually acknowledge that if they spent more time hanging out voter registration forms across the country they be much more effective in contact\nA lot of people don't I mean all of us who doesn't mean that people don't get to object to me to write and American to object\nFor sure is covered in the first amendment but for the other one\nYep sure they certainly here government\nCertainly certainly can do that but what what are you saying and and we're seeing it across the country going to a restaurant and screaming at an elected official in a public restaurant\nAnd they did the thing that there are a fan or they've done the same the course of ... to many members of this and I'm In a strange them because they object with a policy of this president and what ... what\nThe elected officials were elected to do that's not how you go about doing is\nWell you mean as calling and the mob that's not accurate I mean people are good to have ... I mean it's you know that's not my behavior they're angry with the way the country's ... that's my behavior\nThe first amendment does not include\nBought scene down people's doors\nAnd engaging in violence\nAnd it's my behavior they're trying to justify mob behavior\nWe weren't all wrong and we said the Maxine Waters with calling for this\nShow called for it she double and triple down on it\nThese are brown sugar tactics in which they want to find individual to disagree with them and screaming shout and bullied them in public\nThe ... we saw in in in Portland\nThat's not a First

Curtis wields firearms and new Halloween if he despite advocating for gun control\nPeople who are criticizing this ... I think most of the entire point\nAnd of course they do they ... they miss the the absolute point\nAh because these individuals I think that\nThere isn't a good purpose for firearms with civilians period\nI mean that's ... that's what they think that they that there isn't any kind of\nGood use good purpose for firearms and I think that what her movie shows and the fact that she's using guns and it shows that yes\nThere actually is a legitimate\nYou know actual paved\n... they they they can be used for good\nI don't know I just\nI see I have always been has she always been\nDon't think that she is I don't I don't associate politics when I see her you know what I mean most people know him ... and ... and such\nThat I didn't used to have that image for it I Know have that image for them because we haven't been to poke political\nI mean it's just a huge part\nIsn't a huge part of movies today is whether they're in a scary movies or action movies are et cetera isn't a huge\nPortion of the plot good guy with a gun does something useful with a gun to gun solve problems isn't that usually what it is\nAnd so one of my friends asked this question\nShowing that guns are useful has more

and all the people criticizing the Fox ... apparently are too stupid to understand and which is kind of embarrassing everybody wants to go out and the first to like ... back\nBut I'm just like you guys are so new aunt because new onto the dead it has made people dumber the point is is that she is\nFriends asked this question\nShowing that guns are useful has more or less influence than actors advocacy against guns\nAnd it gets do you think\nActors in movies using guns showing that guns are useful and that they solve problems does that have more or less influence than the actors advocate

criticizing the Fox ... apparently are too stupid to understand and which is kind of embarrassing everybody wants to go out and be first to like ... back\nBut I'm just like you guys are so new aunt because new on through the dead it has made people dumber the point is is that she is\nAdvocating against firearms she's an anti gun advocate\nAnd and coming out and supporting\nAnti gone advocacy\nKind of drowned out by the fact that in her film\nShe shows\nThat a gun can solve a problem\nAnd that a gun is useful\nAnd that a gun in the proper hand did not make the person who is wielding it evil it does not\nThrough osmosis transfer to the doctor\nSome sort of maniacal quality\nIt solve the problem\nAnd so it's just kind of funny that she comes out what this advocate the\nAgainst the exact sort of firearm usage\nShe find useful and use this to solve\nProblems with her film and that's the entire point of this\nPeople are like oh my God I mean how you're going after I mean there there were like laughing at\nAre laughing at that I you know the tweet that somebody at Fox put out\nAnd like for instance job to get 'em over at St progress said dear Fox News movies or pretend\nYeah but just showing that gun solve problems isn't pretend\nYou're talking about a firearm solving a problem solving a particular issue while at the same time outside of the film you advocate against that reality\nNow of course Michael Meyers is a fake story but if you think for one second that there hasn't been women\nWho have used a firearm to solve a problem and it's similar fashion a problem of potential rapist or potential it's somebody going to kill them et cetera et cetera\nThan you are mistaken and that's where the that's where the the ... comes in because the advocacy that she preaches off camera is drowned out by the actions of her character showing that in fact guns can be used to solve problems and they can be good\nAnd that's what these people don't seem to understand\nHow how hard is it to go through life that stupid I don't know because I'm smart so I just I just don't know\nI just I it seems kinda\nDumb ... just as in down that was that's an incredibly dumb take\nIncredibly don't take\n'em we have um [noise]\nA system of the latest with hurricane Michael by the way\nAnd some the governor has said too and some of the first responders that also said because there are um [noise]\nSome of the island areas they're near Florida\nUm individuals who did not evacuate\nThey emergency responders will not be able to get to them\nBecause now it has made landfall and it's going to go right up through the southeastern states all the way up to look\nGo through life that stupid I don't know because I'm smart so I just I just don't know\nI just I it seems kinda\nDumb to just as it down that was that's an incredibly dumped take\nIncredibly down take\nUm we have um\nA system of the latest on hurricane Michael by the way\nAnd some the governor has said too and some of the first responders had also said because there are um\nSome of the island areas they're near Florida\nUm individuals who did not evacuate\nThey emergency responders will not be able to get to them\nBecause now it has made landfall and it's going to go right up through the southeastern states all the way up to looks like DC even at some point uh and so they I mean there is going to bring some bad bad weather to the eastern seaboard but\nUh they're saying that those individuals who did not evacuated emergency officials are not going to be able to get they've been calling apparently the emergency lines are open and that they ah emergency responders said we're we're not going to go out there right now so you're going to have to hold tight\nThat's why they tell people to evacuate because of emergency responders don't want to imperil more alive\nBy um going out and\nGetting people who should have evacuated it's too dangerous for them to go out with their vehicles et cetera so anyway I'm\nJust very just I Hope people I Hope people stay safe\nOut there we have more to touch on Florida Man on the way\nAnd I'm Will also\nYou know how I was telling you how Michael ... was challenged on junior to a fight with an actual enemy fighter ... Rosa\nSay what she said well she says don't bring your blank\nBlank posturing blank around him and they go back to the underworld you blink and scrub\nSo that was hard core she could totally taken\nThat's so great so we have Florida Man on the way also Taylor Swift is profiting off of welcome is\nI think she did this because of what kind is doing\nAnd media coverage of Trump getting worse\nThat's really not surprising though is it is it really surprising to anybody I don't think so I don't think it is\nA and we'll also talk to him as very Senate candidate Josh Hawley next

we're trying to cover the sad sad story of why the common person out there or can't get ahead in life\nAnd what the weird perceptions they have about the world and weakness is they have as a human being that keep them from coming successful were doing case study on an email the gentleman sent me about how from his early in life he's changed his\nHis skill set over and over and over again to try to stay ahead of ah\nOf societies are [noise] like which were protected logical advancements\nAnd he has not been able to keep up now I'm going to pick it back up or says he just became a programmer and he says since there was a lot of demand for programmers background I was making a lot of money and figured I finally found the courage to rely on those stop right there for a second I was making a lot of money whereas all that money\nWhy Disney on five ten Fifteen houses why the ... department complex where's all the money\nSee this is the thing no matter what you do you think you're going to get ahead because you have a good job at a better job with the best job or an incredible job it's still a job and you earn and you spend and you earn and you spend your earning you're spending not building any wealth\nYou're not getting anywhere in society and yet you think the world is wrong because they show you up and spit you out\nThat's because technology will always change if you were a guy that made saddles two hundred years ago you probably had a pretty good business or really a pretty good job now you're broke right if you shoot horses back then you had a great job or business\nI was making a lot of money and figured I finally found the correct to rely on other stop right there for a second I was making a lot of money whereas all that money\nWhy Disney on five ten Fifteen houses what in the department complex where's all the money see this is the thing no matter what you do you think you're going to get ahead because you have a good job at better job with the best job or an incredible job\nIt's still a job and you earn and you spend in you earn and you spend your earning you're spending your not building any wealth you're not getting anywhere in society and yet you think the world is wrong because they show you up and spit you out\nThat's because technology will always change if you were a guy that made saddles two hundred years ago you probably had a pretty good business or really a pretty good job now you're broke right if you shoot horses back then you had a great job or business are you bro\nSee everything changes constantly\nYou either have to change with it or you have to get out of line of change I'm an advocate you through this show today that you can do one or the other you can either change with it or you can step out advocate away from it by just becoming financially free and not have to worry about where society goes both of those items work\nSo it goes on and says that was until social media\nBecame popular and now people can share their ideas on line without needing a programmer or hire a cheap one which I predict would happen some day in the future so I got out of this business so he ran again again it wasn't a business it was a job I change jobs again I'm a something for nothing instantaneously gravitationally diseased\nGuy that likes to hop from job to job to job or basically type a personality to not be so brutal those you know where the type a personality as it's somebody who will throw mud on the wall hope something sticks he changes his mind or her mind\nOver and over and over again they started thousand projects finished none of them right these are the typical Taipei People\nThat are up there just always looking for a way to make a fast buck there's no investment in the future in this type of mentality none what has he done to invest in the future and why should he deserve do not have to work hard for the rest of his life he's done nothing to change that out what\nGoes on and says I figure I Need to have the skill where I Do not have to compete with the whole world that is high demand\nSo think about that shape I now figure I Need a skill that I don't have to compete\nWhile is that not complete and total giving up I mean that's just I give up\nI needed skilled is so low that no human being would want it there's no competition for this job right and so because there's no competition for the job to job is so\nTerrible that I'll be saving right\nSo what did you do then became a truck driver push I'm currently doing and love it except now I hear about how they're making driverless cars and semis which I'm sure we'll workplace our job one day\nYeah one day they will and when they do you still be broke ... still be looking for another job and you know\nUntil they make guys that clean toilets there's going to be a lot of janitorial jobs around maybe it'll make a robotic limb slow Sunday then you lose a job too but what have you done to invest in the future and by the way why does he like driving a truck out driven trucks before mass of solitude no competition\nNo argumentation nobody to deal with\nYou just sit there by yourself in total solitude don't have to interact with the world's boy nice job great job do you make any money you know we have a future\nBecame a truck driver push I'm currently doing and love it except now I hear about how they're making driverless cars and semis which I'm sure we'll workplace our job one day\nYeah one day they will and when they do you still be broke ... still be looking for another job and you know\nUntil they make guys that clean

world's boy nice job great job do you make any money you know we have a future you know what happens when you can't drive anymore yes you'll be out of work and broke\nIt goes on and says here's the reason for this email a hearing on the radio recently stating that you are expanding nationwide and opening up new officers and other states that's a good thing for your business since you're already successful and say that you have more money than you will ever need\nI just wonder if you grow so large and add thousands of do preferred members that your second deal\nThat the second a deal comes available it will be gone within two seconds to to so many people doing going out very\nWell my friend that's already true\nGood deals don't last when there was an opportunity to make a hundred percent return it doesn't matter if we had ten people or ten thousand people the deals are going to be sucked up right but the reality is that what you're talking about is you're talking about the abundance mentality or lack there out you believe in a zero sum game the reality of the world you believe\nFor me to have a dollar I have to take it from you for you to have a dollar you have to take it from somebody else is that there's not enough hours to go round the simply isn't true\nAnd I'm going to cover it after I finished a pair of ... says or worse a multibillion dollar company will see what you are doing and duplicate your business model and spend millions in advertising worldwide to point to the point where no houses or apartments will be available as investments since they will be bought before you can even see it\nI'll let me tell you a little secret no one's going to duplicate this business because lifestyles does something that no corporate America company could ever duplicate it gives back\nIt has the abundance mentality and believes it doesn't have to have all of the business it believes that can give it away to its customers and let us customers become rich instead of it becoming rich in other words I could have been a Donald Trump I could have said I Want to own all the she'll say I can talk people embarrassing and me I get on billions and billions of dollars of apartment complexes\nWith all the members I have but I was not interested in me being a billionaire I was interested in my members becoming millionaires and so instead of me taking all the millions and adding up to billions\nWe taught people's go out and earn the millions and we help them do that\nNo corporation in America can be founded on that kind of generosity it's impossible no company could ever survived that business model except my why because I've already read before I started in ... I'm not greedy and you just won't find that many people that way right\nMost people go to work because they want to make money that you you go to work every day because you want to make money\nI go to work every day because I Want to help people\nAnd I don't go to work every day that's the beauty of it I own a business that is out there I go to work on the radio one hour a day I go to work a once a month or two a two day just so I stay involved in my members and know that the message is still tight\nThey're not working in the business is not a job they're investing in a business that is an ongoing concern that as a product it's pretty hard to outdated self because think about it for just a second\nWhether they're going to invent a way for us to vaporize ourselves to go to bed at night and sleep we have to have a place to lay out head down at night to eat our dinners et cetera et cetera so until they have vaporize Asian\nWe have housing that when they have vapors Asia and guess what I'm going to invest in vapors Asian\nRight but until then\nHousing has been around forever and probably will be around for a lot longer\nOkay so here it is the guy saying do you could steal all the deals no I couldn't steal all the deals because if I didn't have a group of like minded people we wouldn't have enough money to go out and do all the deals now the next point he's making is once we teach all these people all over the world how to do this there is not going to be enough deals no here's a reality\nI've been doing this in Houston, Texas for Thirty years\nAnd we're still doing deals at a higher rate than we've ever done a map before\nSo that part is ally we went to Dallas we've been doing it there for Fifteen Years\nStill doing deals at a faster rate than ever before San Antonio Austin the same thing but now which you have to understand that for twenty six years in Houston I've had lifestyles we still haven't even touched the market we put a dent in the microwave scratch the edge of the market\nBecause there's so many apartment complexes there's like three thousand apartment complex in Houston three thousand dollars three thousand to San Antonio and Austin and that's only just Texas\nThat's not counting ... not counting the nine we own down in Corpus Christi et cetera et cetera so here's a point when we expand to a new area like Atlanta where we're going\nThat whole city has Thirty Years' worth prospect of action for us we haven't even begun it just like when they told us when we were high school when I was in high school the stupid idiots told us there was Twenty years of oil that\nTwenty years and that's where the oil\nThat's the lack mentality now there's a hundred years of oil left in each of about five countries out there right in Egypt\nThat's the edge of the market because there's so many apartment complexes there's like three thousand apartment complexes in Houston three thousand in Dallas three thousand in San Antonio and Austin and that's only just Texas\nThat's not counting Midler not counting the nine we own down in Corpus Christi et cetera et cetera so here's the point when we expand to a new area like Atlanta where we're going\nThat whole city has Thirty Years' worth prospect of action for us we haven't even begun it just like when they told us when we were high school when I was in high school the stupid idiots told us there was Twenty years of oil that\nTwenty years and that's where the oil\nThat's the lack mentality now there's a hundred years of oil left in each of about five countries out there right in each of five couldn't factor is probably a hundred years while in two or three states in this country just one state and yet we still believe we have an oil no\nWe believe that there's so many apartment complexes that if we signed up as many people's rehab in Texas in every other state and union there's there'll be enough business from to do that and that will be ten lifetimes before that happens\nBut my point is is with all of that said where they're being true to disguise totally miss the mark with his email my point you is how sad is it for him\nBecause here he is now thirty six years of age\nAnd here's what he believes it seems like the only secure jobs for those who are not already rich are the ones that take many years of sacrifice and credentials such as being a doctor or lawyer which is something not everyone is willing to do that is the demand will always be high there it is\nThe only thing you can get rich doing is being a doctor or lawyer\nA thing that which most of us are not willing to do\nFor you just nailed it for himself ... hey I'm happy that I'm not rich I'm unhappy that I haven't been successful my whole life but I'm not willing to either go do something you would put me to position it couldn't be copied or number to stick with anything and get better at it like I should have got better at electronics I should have got better at programming but\nI didn't I didn't I didn't I just kept running and now I'm a\nTruck driver wow he goes on and said I just wanted to see if you could perhaps sway my negative way of thinking about this since it's a very since it seems that every money making opportunity will eventually go way of the buggy whip\n[noise] think about it every money making opportunity he spoke of was about work\nIt was about later it was about doing something to somebody else doesn't\nWant to do and it's that belief system which is killing them\nThink about it if you want to start investing when he was Twenty years old and real estate\nThe houses that I bought twenty six years ago are still there people are still living and I don't know because I'm like this guy I progressed in my knowledge of my business\nSo I went from houses duplex is the four Plex his small apartments to medium size apartment to the large apartment\nI progress my skills that knowledge base right now I'm trying to do class apartments I'm pushing myself to progress my skill set because I Know that the old stuff will eventually be old too old using the new stuff I'll have to understand so I have to be on the cutting edge that's where the class I got to be in the cutting edge of the business\nBut this gentleman doesn't want to be on the cutting edge he doesn't want to do anything he wants to go backwards\nHe wants to trade time for money

how to spell Kavanaugh they would've felt it with a team because they don't know him that he doesn't have a number of it because he he got angry\nPossibly lied but not going and further and admitting that he had blacked out well you know what if he passed out or not lucky already admitted that he had too many beers so what let's hear what the Democrats the Democrats did not only as high school seniors not only as college students not only as\nUm as a whatever a lawyers or whatever they were in the earlier the early career\nBut how about if the Democratic national convention ... years ago when they got drunk on there but how about when they went like every Democrat in Sacramento that's solving a female assistant all over the last five years let's talk about that you guys one of them even claim that the the level of\nStupidity here is beyond belief you know what there was that general who said stuck on stupid I Want to tell you the Democrats are reflecting stupidity on steroids that they are different SOS\nSomebody ... tell one of your Democrats friend if you got any have you got any less because once they find out you voted for Trump they just pulled up their tail to go there and hold their nose and\nNor at you and everything else because you're you're\nPart of the deplorable Doug gun and I'm proud to be a deplorable you know being a deplorable means I'm being accused by somebody I have so little respect for as virtually every Democrat but one of them even went so far as to say\nThat he never had that he they claimed that he was lying there this is unbelievable unbelievable claiming that they have it on the line when he said that he had too many beers\nGot the Democrats name I Can't remember which I had it but that he had too many beers was a was a lie that he was attempting to defuse the matter by suggesting that he admitted to something you really didn't do to try to put it at rest and just say okay hey I had too many beers like a lot of kids in high in college\nPart of the deplorable dart gun and I'm proud to be a deplorable you know being a deplorable means I'm being accused by somebody I have so little respect for as virtually every Democrat but one of them even went so far as to say\nThat he never had that he they claimed that he was lying there this is unbelievable unbelievable claiming that that Kevin always lying when he said that he had too many beers\nEver got the Democrats name I I Can't remember which I had it\nBut that he had too many beers was a was a lie that he was attempting to defuse the matter by the judge dangling that he admitted to something you really didn't do to try to put it at rats and just say okay hey I had too many beers like a lot of kids in high in college\nThen we get to over to the loser Anita Hill I told you earlier on this woman I Know\nFairly well haven't talked with her and he on logical but I Know are very well from law school had her in multiple classes and had it out with her in her chambers if you will in her office\nBecause I could see a distinct political bent you Anita Hill's proper story I'll attitude Thirty years ago thirty wait a minute yeah Thirty years ago almost thirty five years ago\nSo she said about the the hearing last week ... Kavanaugh was able to express our real anger and aggression as well as a lot of emotion and ah she went on to say no female Supreme Court candidate would ever have a license to express yourself in that way\nYou know what Anita Hill is justice dumb today and she was then now some people who are like that and I'm not trying to pat myself on the back when I got to explain\nSomething to you about Anita Hill to this day this is uncomfortable for me to say but there's an award in law school called the American jurisprudence award\nShort ... short for American Jurisprudence the law school I graduated from regent university no student has ever gotten more damage or awards then I I don't even remember how many I got an eleven or twelve\nFolks God blessed to me in law school I'm a man of average intelligence might catch will prove that my law school aptitude test came back your average\nI took it again and said you're still average I took it a third time and it came back to that which I knock it off you're still average okay I'm average\nI went to law school God Bless a lot of hard work graduated person in my law school class and still hold the record for the most American Jurisprudence or jet region University in uh Virginia Beach Virginia\nI had Anita Hill for several classes\nFor all of the students came up to me and said well Rob you're not going to get the American jurisprudence word and in the hills class which happened to be I think it was one of the second one was commercial transactions\nAnd I said why is that just because she doesn't know what she's talking about and you know more about the subject then she dies you ought to be teaching that\nI say that only to say this woman still to this day does not know what she's talking about now I Want to also say jeeze an extremely nice person I never just light Anita Hill I liked her personally I mean yeah we had it out\nWhat as a person I thought she was genuine I really truly liked her\nVirtually in Virginia Beach Virginia I had Anita Hill for several classes\nSeveral of the students came up to me and said well Rob you're not going to get the American jurisprudence word and in the hills class which happened to be I think it was one of the second one was commercial transactions\nAnd I said why is that just because she doesn't know what she's talking about and you know more about the subject and she dies you ought to be teaching and\nI say that only to say this woman still to this day does not know what she's talking about now I Want to also say jeeze an extremely nice person I never just light Anita Hill I liked her personally I mean yeah we had it out\nBut as a person I thought she was genuine I really truly liked her and I told her that\nI got a difference of opinion but it's not because I don't like you I think she was unqualified for teaching law school that's all I was saying I'm not I I maybe if I said she was dumb I I didn't mean that she and I got to retract that if I did say that\nBut and I think I did but she was unqualified and she's also unqualified to make some of these statements\nSo let me ask you um\nWell she said we're goes on on to say here well no I got to go back to no female Supreme Court Kennedy would ever have the license to express yourself in that way\nAnd grow and you know why because no Supreme Court\nCandidate who is female or would be or ever has been whether it's Denver Ginsberg who is a complete loser whether it's Kagan who's an absolute lose or whether it's sort of my or oh I'm Sorry all three women are losers are women loses no but all three women on the Supreme Court are losers\nBecause none of them ever were asked the kinds of questions\nThat Kavanaugh was what did you put this sort of my or what did you put in your book and where are you how many times where you were drunk and you're black and how did you pass out and you know walk when did you ever grab some guy by the whatever when what with all kinds of questioning which would have produced that kind of a response\nFrom my ... are Kagan were those questions ever asked no they never got to the point where they ever would have been entitled to have righteous indignation\nNever got there that's why\nAnita Hill can stay there and I got to say this is sort of idiots aren't educated up her to make this point which because there has been has there been a double standard yeah there has been women have been treated as Supreme Court in other judicial nominees much nicer much nicer than men\nYou say well men can get away with saying that well you know what women aren't attacked the way that men are attacked either because men are considered fair game with one exception maybe that Hillary Clinton because it's easy to attacker\nI mean look Hillary Clinton is the wicked witch of the ...\nI mean that's what a good fire on our website right W.

seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars set aside if they can earn ... percent of their money they had to set aside two hundred and thirty nine dollars a month\nOr fear fear a fifty fifty year old that number ... number becomes a little bit over two thousand dollars a month or two hundred a month for a twenty year old or two thousand a month for a fifty year old earning six percent will generate seven hundred and fifty thousand\nMaybe even do like a fifty fifty or some type of split again it's all part of the planning idea of looking at where gay waste is continue to save\nBut say in a smart way you know for twenty year old right now is projecting out if they wanted to say maybe to get to let's see eight sixty five\nAnd get a I'm Sorry uh my numbers I took it eight sixty seven a

for a fifty year old earning six percent will generate seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nBy age sixty seven but the thing is\nDon't get bogged down on among numbers you want to save as much as possible coupons saving so the early years maybe less responsibility the ability to save and the ability to save his high\nThen you get in like the ... years the mid working years there's more challenges you know perhaps ah children polls on different of ah Arab avenues from your finances\nYou know maybe you're a you know again children\nYou know this uh taking care of them may be looking at maybe do I save some for college for them to juggle between savings for college and from our retirement you know what should I be doing\nBut the main thing is maintaining your savings maintaining it may be trying to increase it to write perhaps maybe you're getting a raise or increasing your income you know try to earmark that some additional for saving through their retirement plan\nAnd then also may be outside of their retirement plan to mean that goes even for the younger people to build up those non retirement money too\nAnd then they can be used for retirement but they could also be used for a additional savings\nOr emergency reserves but also maybe you know maybe five years from now you're looking to put some money down on a new house or something so again the made years about a lot more challenges but again still want to continue to save and save\nLet's say you get to age fifty between age Fifteen fifty five now that you really start to focus in on your savings\nOr maybe some expenses I mean maybe being cut down or maybe they're gone back up maybe you know you've got college costs now\nBut uh again you start to look at continuing to save and save a lot of people in

before the end of the year besides taxes it may be looking at your investments right you know looking at the your goals your strategy your risk tolerance maybe you got a little lax a little you see on the rich because everything's been going so good\nWhen I'm maybe reevaluate your risk\nOr we can get your rich DNA number you go to our website PFC radio dot com and you can see right on the front page of the box that click on to see what your risk number is an easy step to go through it's not the traditional risk tolerance question you're there may be they have you been exposed to\nYou know maybe that one that I mean because you're a little bit older than me and you should be less risky now it's gonna take it through a little different stuff a couple a little bit of different exercise certain dollar amount are you comfortable with a potential gain or a lot in the next six months you know\nAnd then I'll take you through the next question similar to that a couple of two or three times and it gives you a number between zero and one hundred and eight hundred being the most\nRich because everything's been going so good\nWhen I'm maybe reevaluate your risk\nOr we can get your rich DNA number you go to our website PFC radio dot com and you can see right on the front pages of box the click on to see what your risk number is an easy step to go through it's not the traditional risk tolerance question here that maybe they have you been exposed to\nYou know maybe that one at ... because you're a little bit older than me and you should be less risky now that's gonna take it through a little different stuff a couple a little bit of different exercise certain dollar amount are you comfortable with a potential gain or laws in the next six months yet now\nAnd then you know take you through the next question similar to that a couple of two or three times and it gives you a number between zero and one hundred and eight hundred being the most risk zero the less risk and we can take that number then eventually compared to where you're at\nThe idea of your risk a risk DNA number\nAlso want to maybe you know the idea of a position in all your money we talked about that as far as retirement planning the position of your assets for the eventual income in retirement and that becomes part of something maybe that would be looking at it before the end of the year\nIf you have employee stock options you know me one of maybe look at how that's going or what that how that plays out for yourself\nAnother idea then to related to investment but overall planning into the retirement side before the end of the year and he again max or maximizing now you're four one K. contributions including catch ups\nYou know a ... you know catch up provisions if you're over age fifty fifty and over again at least taking advantage of the employer match you know looking at if you're making IRA contributions\nCan you do a maybe a backdoor Roth IRA was the day I mean or maybe you don't qualify for Ross contribution\nMaybe you'd like to you want to put money into Ross your employer doesn't have it through their retirement plan you like to do a lot but you make too much income\nThe way you do is maybe possibly look at contributing to an IRA when you say well I can while you can you just can't duck did\nNot a duck to Bahrain then right away on the day it's like in the day right after converted to a raw\nI have to pay tax on the conversion run all because you did not adopted\nThe make that a backdoor Roth IRA contribution I give you more information on that too it's not for everybody but something to be thinking about\nBut you want to look at it again doesn't make sense to put money into Iraq does it make sense to convert some existing IRA money to Roth IRA money tax rates are low this ... this year maybe you'd do a portion\nYou know if you have a hundred thousand dollars maybe you convert the whole hundred thousand to a rod you're well wow that's a lot of tax go back to your tax prepare your tax system put that in you say well now I don't like that I liked the idea of putting money into rockets can be tax free\nBut I have to pay the tax now and so maybe instead of putting a hundred thousand enter converting a hundred thousand maybe this convert a portion of it maybe like ten percent of it ten thousand or twenty percent of the twenty thousand put it back into your tax system maybe that makes more sense but one thing is very important\nIf you do this you don't have the opportunity anymore to re converted back you cannot re characterize it back that opportunity will not exist anymore in the past and you actually do have it if you can Vernon irate Roth IRA and two thousand and Seventeen\nYou have up until October fifteenth of this year to re converted back and re characterize it back\nPerhaps you made a mistake you didn't I I you all underestimated the tax\nAnd you say well now I don't like the idea I liked the idea of putting money into rockets can be tax free\nBut I have to pay the tax now and so maybe instead of putting a hundred thousand enter converting a hundred thousand maybe this convert a portion of it maybe like ten percent of it ten thousand or twenty percent of the twenty thousand put it back into your tax system maybe that makes more sense but one thing is very important\nIf you do this you don't have the opportunity anymore to re converted back you cannot re characterize it back that opportunity will not exist anymore in the past and you actually do have it if you can Vernon irate Roth IRA and two thousand and Seventeen\nYou have up until October fifteenth of this year to re converted back and re characterize it back\nPerhaps you made a mistake you didn't I I you all underestimated the taxes they owe more\nPossibly but maybe not so much likely the value of your account went down\nSo you pay tax on a higher mountain yeah lower my now so maybe you re converted back and then maybe converted back again this year but if that re character is to re characterization does not exist anymore going forward so once you convert\nIrate the Roth IRA money that's it you're done you can go back to make sure
