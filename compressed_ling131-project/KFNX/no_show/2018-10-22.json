I mean there's really no turning back to haunt me up any choice dot org under a shock you can you know the some of the courses and learn about that kid but\nAbsolutely homey apathy I mean we have had to tie go\nUm she wrote an infection ear infection my daughter had a urinary tract infection she seemed to have inherited a little bit of my weak bladder and ah and time again on the\nLine one infection and I did work with my medical doctor and a professional homeopathy I'm for this situation\nBut my ... my husband actually got stung by a beam and he's not allergic to be but um that the steam turned into the light is pretty down quickly and um\nIt's a it's a tricky thing and and absolutely antibiotics as the first thing that you know doctors will we used to take care of that\nAnd you know of course we we will use antibiotics if we have to if if we're in a you know I called her role like life threatening situation but I'm a you know we we try to kind of addressed it\nRight away from the beginning with homey apathy and at work I mean the infection kind of got pretty\nPretty intense right there at the beginning and then before we knew what he was on the road to recovery and he was better within five days and let's hope youthful about a situation like that\nIs that ... for example take usually a large amount of antibiotics and they tend to come back over and over again the Saudi led section they tend to be very resistant to antibiotics and it was just fantastic to have remedies in my home\nBut I was able to use for my husband um we specifically is della Donna you know it was red hot and robbing his arm and and I can identify a ... situation very quickly when I see that red hot and driving symptoms\nAnd we use that and we use it a couple of other remedies and during the whole course that within five days it was like nothing had ever happened and it's just so wonderful for me as a mother to be able to take care of my family like that\nThat's a beautiful thing about whom he obviously when do you have an acute situation in your home of course traditionally give that pediatrician call you go to the emergency room you have to wait and then it's you're kind of like taking potluck are you going to get somebody who has experience or called but it\nBut the beautiful thing is coming up and say doesn't cause any harm you know if you prescribe ...\nSo it's not the right remedy and you don't see an improvement world anew seek help with a with a professional but some of these situations who her life and especially if you're a mom you know what you want to take care of your kids immediately\nAnd you see them suffering and ah you know time is a factor show why don't reach into your only about the remedy kit and a prescribe a remedy and just to observe the reaction\nOf right you know raising my three kids so mean article was my friend you know when my son just go after bicycling or screaming bloody murder [laughter]\nNow give them a little bit of articles and ah the pain went away and they quickly we're back on the bicycle like like nothing happened and the same thing with a so many colds and flus you know traditional medicine\nAre waiting though was above ... which is humorous because most\nFlus are caused by a virus and every bodies have very little effect but\nYou know what you want to take care of your kids immediately\nAnd you see them suffering and uh you know time is a factor show why don't reach into your only about the remedy kit and a prescribe of a remedy and just to observe the reaction\nOf right and you know raising my three kids so in order to go was my friend the other one of my sons stole Arthur bicycling or screaming bloody murder [laughter] now give them a little bit of articles and ah the pain went away and they quickly we're back on the bicycle like like nothing happened\nAnd the same thing with the so many colds and flus you know traditional medicine all but you know as a bioethics which is humorous because most flus are caused by a virus and if it was a very little effect but to go to the pediatrician or to get a dinner by Arctic\nAnd we asked we actually right now we're living on a broad for two years but we um our home bases in Texas and we have a farm you have enough Kelly have chicken the beans and garden and without no ... I mean she she got ...\nOne and I'm a couple of other infections her calf only castrated because you know\nBold if they're not kept trying to get really dangerous and aggressive [noise]\nUm and you know he got in touch after being captured and which actually it was a happen very often then again\nYou know I work at the that to identify with what's going on how serious it was because he got a kind of be smart about it and no one wants you to be on why they're foolish but my goodness honey apathy with my farm animals it works so well once the correct remedy is selected\nIt works so well that's really about educating yourself you know partnering with a really great homeopathic can be you know your family home my path and you can get out we can avoid a lot of drugs\nWith the with these you know with kind of\nPlanning ahead and preparing yourself and that's what I think monitor so great at right you you look into any mom person they're prepared with a bunch of things in my purse had our neck I like you said for those accidents it has um\nHas lead on a test and act and I and I always carry that wherever I go because on the Applebee's is so fantastic it really truly as mothers medicine in many ways\nYou know I'm I have to ask you this question but for the listeners who may not know what are we up with the is\nYou know I always told by patients\nSometimes it's easier to explain would hold me up with the is ought to what it is\nAnd I think I already touched on the subject at home you up at the is not herbal medicine it's not good nutrition ... diet so I'd exercised show me opposite he is a particular science it's a particular way of treating disease from from the white person's perspective\nUm how do you explain told me opposite each people\nSo I actually have to do this a lot because um because of the Americans for homeopathy choice on we have a lot of opportunities to talk to people on Capitol Hill and absolutely they don't know a lot of hung out if he is and so basically the best way to explain it is it follows the principle\nOf like ... like they call it a lot of similarities in\nInternational medicine they even use us on summers have seen it with vaccines\nWhere you take a small amount of something and it helps\nPrevent or cure or something I'm not advocating for a vaccine but it that's kind of have that last summer's they've also seen this in um\nAllergy treatment where people have allergies they take small doses of that allergen and they build an immunity to it and so when I go on Capitol Hill I compare it to anything that we already know about it for fighting and we're we're generally comfortable with but again not advocating those methods but it's just kind of a point of reference points on hold me up at the moment\nWe take substances that produced\nNow the choice on we have a lot of opportunity to talk to people on Capitol Hill and absolutely they don't know a lot of hung out if he is and so basically the best way to explain it is it follows the principle of like ... like they call it the last similar isn't\nIn conventional medicine they even use us on summers they've seen it with vaccines\nWhere you take a small amount of something and it helps\nPrevent or cure or something I'm not advocating for vaccines but it does kind of have that last summer's have also seen this in um\nAllergy treatment where people have allergies they take small doses of that allergen and they build an immunity to it and so when I go on Capitol Hill I compare it to these things that we already know about us for fighting and we're we're generally comfortable with but again not advocating those methods but it's just kind of a point of reference on homeopathy on\nWe take substances that produce symptoms in their original state and we use them and their diluted states to cure a similar symptoms so\nMy favorite example the example of onion we've all cut an onion my kids want to you know we're we're being ridiculous and they've been into an onion and boy the eyes were watering the nose was running but it wasn't green sick runny nose and it's going to be that egg white clear runny nose I'm burning in the eyes burning in the nose and so\nYou know think of in Illinois that producers do similar symptoms egg white runny nose watery eyes burning I got a cold got you know allergies and so what you do there is\nIf you have those symptoms then you're sick you take the homeopathic form of an onion which is um we use a Latin term right on the ... and that is going to help get it's going to get your body the information that need\nTo address that illness and bring about balance and um and that's that's an important part of our political things that we're doing is homey apathy is not um\nIt is technically listed as a drug in the food drug and cosmetic act in legally technically a drug but that but it has nothing to do with drones dried treat disease homey Augustine\nEmpowers the person to get the right information the body needs the body stuck capture itself\nGives the information that means now it can cure itself you know and and it's it's similar to acupuncture a lot of other natural things you know you ... the the acupuncture needles aren't\nSharing a disease it's bringing down the body for the balance to to kind of get over this block whatever it is and to finalize curing it and so that's all me up at the end of selecting the remedy that have\nThat mimic the disease that you have and the remedy is\nOn and this was a beautiful part the remedies are so diluted and that's one of the criticisms that it's too early to to work well it does work and we've observed is higher than their spouses of clinical trials in papers and studies about how homey up as he can be effective\nAnd and our focus is you know what\nThere's a lot of skeptics hung out to the this like he'll like doesn't make sense and and they don't understand how something that's so diluted down\nThat how it can work but guess what that then that's okay if if someone doesn't think it works and don't buy it don't use it Americans for homeopathy choice the mama bears out homey apathy choice we believe in freedom for us to try something inherently safe before during or after we've tried conventional medicine\nDown how it can work\nI guess what mocked okay if it's some I think it works from don't buy it don't use that Americans for homeopathy choice the monetary hung out to be trained we believe in freedom for us to try hunting inherently safer for during or after we've tried conventional matter\nA robo homeopathic shoe store each homeopathic remedies to go through studies that would destroy the opposite which is ... millions of dollars to get one drug approved and we have probably oh well over a thousand different homeopathic remedies\nThat in the back and you're you're you're hitting the nail on the head right now you think you're right and that's totally right\nAnd and let me give you a little bit of background on why this is happening so in the seventies or you know I I forget my date but I think it was in the seventies you know there is a strategy that came out and it causes all the deformity than women because in babies because women took them while they're pregnant so then the FDA decided okay not only do that because at the\nBeginning Afghans out what to make sure drugs are manufactured correctly that what was on the bottle it's in the bottle and that's how\nThat's how they regulate and everything but then then there's you know\nThis driving cause all these problems on these babies and said OK okay now it needs to be\nSafe and effective and not just manufactured correctly it needs to be also be affected well the problem it's not now they're they've realized oh let me out but he has never been evaluated for ethic as the but the problem is all me apathy has never ever\nIn its entire two hundred years had one documented that their permanent disability associated to it there are no risk with which to offset by active in it and so that's what I'm telling everybody on Capitol Hill I said okay it on a surface it seemed like trying to determine whether\nOr not me out of the effect is effective as a good idea but here's the problem there's two problems like this the first one is\nIt is highly individualized medicine if you have allergies and I have allergies and we both take allium pizza it might help us poker my only help when it all depends on what our symptoms are not my allergies presented with an allergic hawk which it it has an impact\nOn the roof of the mouth and itchy ears AMC by which we just talked about what am I\nAccrued and how my body addressed that illness but if your allergies presented that way it's fine it's after he wants to stay at home you know the the the fact that for allergies in the eye and see or they're not going to come out with positive result because they're using conventional drug model to measure effectiveness\nYou know that's a very in college because I shall patients that I have a healer degeneration what homeopathic remedies should I take I tell them well if I treat a hundred folks with macular degeneration each one may need a different homeopathic remedies 'cause we treat the person\nWe just rent the standard\nAnd send the way that Disney's has impacted than even emotionally all of that is part of the collecting of their enemy that's in that and so when I say this to everybody on\nShe works with the mouth and itchy ears IMC by which we just talked about will not\nApproved and how my body addressed that illness but if your allergies presented that way it's fine it's after he wants to the of homeopathy is effective for allergies in the eye and see if they're not going to come out with positive results because they're using conventional drug model to measure effectiveness\nYou know that's a very in college because I tell patients that I have ... degeneration what homeopathic remedies should I take I tell them well if I treat a hundred folks with macular degeneration each one may need a different homeopathic remedies 'cause we treat the person\nWe just rented their leader\nStanding and send the way that disease has impacted than even emotionally all of that is part of the selecting the remedy Beth and Beth and so when I say this to everybody on Capitol Hill I have to say Ninety nine percent of the staffers I'm Talking with they understand\nThey get it and they don't think that applying assistant of medicine which has conventional drug to a different system of medicine the rules for once just them to the others shouldn't be applied across the board\nThing that we have the problem with effective ... is that it will bankrupt homey apathy homeopathic remedies or natural they can't be patented in the same way drugs can and it costs about eight dollars around money to buy\nWell the reason the chronicle drugs can do the new drug application of because they cost a thousand or one for one remedy a new drug application would cost upwards of millions of dollars if not hundreds of millions of dollars per remedy are\nAre on the low tide it would cost three million for him and that's a very low side and so I'm telling them it will this new drug application first it won't work at that tell me off of the up for failure because it's using the wrong system that that is and and then on the other hand it will bankrupt telling me up at the\nUp with the is bankrupt and our freedom of choice will and will not only about ... available for us and of course the ... gonna be a reason why big pharma is encouraging the FDA to do this to eliminate the competition simply\nThat's exactly right well because think about it I didn't mean to things that I had you know I was diagnosed six years and they'll think about the the amount per per year of drugs\nProcedures and surgeries I would've donated it's our dollars go to the pharmaceutical industry and instead for eight dollars around any a a bottle which lasts me almost a year\nEight dollars I sure did this so called one dollar spent on hold me off the it can be quite to\nThousands of dollars in the pharmaceutical drug\nIndustry and that's the concern and then and then I think the most important thing that we need to see here is that the SPA saying you know they're going to prioritize this risk based approach there they're going to force hold me off the the the new drug application but they're only picking a few category the Romney got for whatever reason they think is dangerous well\nNothing in their draft guidance actually limits them from just focusing on those categories technically their draft guidance says that they can do this at their will to all of ... nothing\nUp

advent\nHad been prophesied in the Old Testament unarmed on such as the place of his birth his death and his resurrection are some of the prophecies pertaining to Christ second visit our second advent now being fulfilled and human experience\nYes very definitely so that Jesus first advent his disciples\nKnowing of the kingdom promises of the Old Testament believe that Christ was set up that king immediately\nBut when they learned that this was not to be that Jesus was going away and returning later to set up his kingdom they ask him what would be the scientific return\nIt was an answer to this question that Jesus describe world tension and fears of today one of these prophecies is a new chapter Twenty one and states that that would be up on the earth distress of nations with perplexed at the\nEnd the men's hearts would fail them for fear as they look ahead to the things coming up on the earth\nWill lap prophecy is true world conditions today there is no doubt as a matter of fact beginning with Nineteen hundred and fourteen up the outbreak of the first World War there has been little else but the stress of nations with perplexed\nAnd that that distress has not decreased with the passing of the year now it is a fear that the entire race might be destroyed\nAnd Jesus foretold I'd also\nIn a prophecy recorded and Matthew the twenty fourth chapter versus Twenty one and twenty two he said that at the time of his second visit to where\nThere would be a period of great tribulation a tribulation so great he said that unless it was brought to an end all flash would be destroyed\nWell that is inaccurate preview of the president world situation\nYou know and I have heard people say that President world conditions are in no way related to prophecy that what is happening is simply a matter of history repeating itself but I Am sure there is nothing and\nNow it is a fear that the entire race might be destroyed\nAnd Jesus foretold that also\nIn a prophecy recorded in Matthew the twenty fourth chapter versus Twenty one and twenty two he said that at the time of his second visit to where\nThere would be a period of great tribulation a tribulation so great he said that unless it was brought to an end all flash would be destroyed\nWell well that is an accurate preview of the president world situation\nYou know and I have heard people say that President world conditions are in no way related to prophecy that what is happening is simply a matter of history repeating itself\nBut I Am sure there is nothing and past history concerning a time when the destruction of all of us was threatened as it is today\nAnd that's very true actually\nThe only difference between what Jesus foretold and what our scientists and Mila terrorists and others are saying today is that Jesus prophesied it nearly two thousand years before the wise in this generation recognize a threatened catastrophe\nWhich should give us confidence in the prophecies of the Bible of cars but add what about tomorrow we'll man actually destroy himself in this time of great tribulation that you referred\nTo know who he won't Jesus foretold up the tribulation would be would be brought to close before that happened the reason is at the time has come for the setting up of the long promised kingdom of Christ\nThe prophecies relating to Christ kingdom are then prophecies that refer to the future refer to tomorrow\nYes and they presented very complete viewpoint of what is in store for the family of man under that new government over which Christ will be the head\nFor instance the profit ... wrote that of the increase of his government and the peace there should be no end\nMeaning that there will be a worldwide and lasting peace eventually\nRight and another prophecy states that the knowledge of the lord shall fill the earth as the water's cover the C\nMeaning the end of all superstitions and create all religious conflicts and persecution at the time will come when they won't exist\nAnd that's right another prophecy tells it then none she'll make them afraid number less them this the notes genuine freedom from fear\nThank God for that kind of like some of the other prophecies of tomorrow I'd like to hear them you know\nRussell even when the world's assured of these blessings we've just mentioned freedom from fear and freedom from war and so forth

may be and they haven't been able to get it on their own so why not it's not economy it's not the weather is nothing any anything but they're thinking right or thinking needs to change because\nIf you keep thinking the same thoughts because you believe the same thing\nYou'll keep doing the same thing you keep getting the same results so think about it if you're always been on that couch guess why you'll always be on the couch until you change your thinking\nAnd that's what we do we get you to change your thinking all of a sudden you become successful you\nKnow yesterday we were talking on and I'm not going to say exactly everything that we were talking about ... I Want to say there's a lot of people think\nThat hit hypnosis is a little weird you know or they think that they don't believe in it or this and that and there's even says something people that just don't even want to think about it but you were talking about it was very interesting talking about that side of\nWell it's you dad the thing is we was on a mixed TV on channel seven yesterday promoting your new show coming out and that happens man just happened to a an eerie ha yeah here's ears perked up when he found out I wasn't just the executive producer of your TV show but\nI was actually have no therapist and because his wife is they have no therapist and so he he spent all probably a half an hour with is just ... and in a quest man quiz me and everything else about it and it's it's just really kind of neat I Love my job is ...\nBut I Want to say this a lot of people think that hit hypnosis is a little weird you know or they think that they don't believe in it or this and that and as he says something people that just don't even want to think about it but you were talking about it was very interesting talking about that side of\nIt well it's you and the thing is is that we was on a mixed TV on channel seven yesterday promoting your new show coming out and pat man just happened to um Iraq it yeah it was ears perked up when he found out I wasn't just the executive producer of your TV show but\nI was actually I have no therapist and because his wife is a little therapist and so he ... he spent all probably a half an hour with is just talking to and and a question man quiz me and everything else about it\nAnd it's it's just really kind of neat I Love my job is not really a job at all it's it's a it's a love of my life how would I go to the next level of success\nI loved when you were talking about you and what you do you've been all over the world doing this you are telling them the schools 'cause you know he was asking you questions that everybody else should be asking yeah my ... never even ask you that on the air so why should talk about 'cause it's very interesting you\nDid you get involved in ... and and and and your schooling because he asked you that\nThat's right I actually got into hip no therapy or by mistake I was going to do it for stage work and I used to own night clubs and I was going to do my own a a a stage show\nAnd I signed up to the school that got hit by a hypnosis and I didn't know anything about him no therapy I just knew about the funny side of it\nWas talking about people that come in and I give them a free our because they have the misconceptions what hypnosis isn't and what a hip no therapist does and enough therapy doesn't have to be grueling it doesn't have to be hard and it doesn't have\nThe negative on facts all mine is very positive in motivational because there's two reasons people fail at anything I don't care what it is first they don't know how to succeed\nSecond they don't want to bad enough so we got to motivate you so when I'm working with people I ... I ... says first I got an education then I got to motivate yet then we go back and find out what keeps drawing you back in the past to either smoking or or drugs or uh over eating and eating the wrong foods\nPlus everybody out there that's overweight everybody knows why they're overweight and a lotta times I'll just look at people when they come man we go over thanks I'll say I know what you're overweight and it was because you eat the wrong foods is wrong times at the wrong quantity for the wrong reason don't eat up the right foods\nDon't drink enough water and they probably don't do enough that she has their sad that they are eating for their self gratification their ... and that's what they're doing\nSome people fail at anything I don't care what it is first they don't know how to succeed\nSecond they don't want to bad enough so we got to motivate you so when I'm working with people I ... I still am I says first I got to educate him then I got to motivate yet then we go back and find out what keeps drawing you back in the past to either smoking or or drugs or uh overeating and eat in their own food\n'cause everybody out there that's overweight everybody knows why they're overweight and a lot of times I'll just look at people when they come in when you go over thanks I'll say I know what you're overweight and it was because you eat the wrong foods is wrong times for the wrong quantity for the wrong reason don't eat up the right foods\nDon't drink enough water and they probably don't do enough that she has\nTheir sad that they are eating for their self gratification\nTheir ... and that's what they're doing their self medicating with food and a lot of times when people quit smoking on their own they've gained weight in fact even their doctors will tell them you're probably gain ten to Fifteen pounds I said that's the worst and you can tell a client\nMy clients never gain weight and they probably if they're overweight they take off a few pounds because they get more options your system and I explained to it or to them why they will and most people are not prepared to stop smoking or getting off the drugs and we prepare him first and then all of a sudden ...\nNobody takes it away from all of a sudden they don't want they don't need any longer that's why there is no withdrawals\nNow we have everybody calling him direct because he likes that to have you leave a message on its own\nIf you want to walk on water you got to get out of the boat so let's go ahead and pick up that phone that number six had to fight for seven zero for for six it's hypnotic the number one dot com\nIt's hot out there and I know it's the summer and no one wants to deal with all this but it's a great time to do it now because you know what what is now going to not be the summer and you're going to be on top of your game you're going to be ready to go and that our weather whatever it is that you want to do before the holiday is still think oh I'm gonna do it after the holiday let's do it now\nThat's ... ... if you don't do it now when you see that's the big question you gotta ask yourself what ... been procrastinating so long and procrastination seems to be the the biggest disease out there if you're going to call anything a disease of progress nation probably is\nBecause it seems to be catching one person doesn't next person does finally you see yourself sitting on my couch forever if you want to sit there that's fine I'm not trying to get to that person I'm getting to the person that's very successful do you want to be even more successful or their mediocre and they want to go to that winning from just being success\nHere's the thing of addicts folks okay there's a lot of people out there that are procrastinators and you know you've got to do something when you get to the lowest\nOf lows that's what it is people get to the lowest have loads and they say I Can't take this any longer I Can't walk up the steps anymore I Can't put on my pants I Can't see my shoes whatever it is\nThat's it and and and when when it's about weight 'cause I've been there and I everybody that has been there when you get tired of buying clothes because you can't fit into um you finally say you know what am I going to stop doing this in what am I going to start going in the other direction or what do I have to do\nEven myself here a while back when I heard something I was gaining weight and hide finally says and that's it\nNow's the time to change I Know what to do I talk to thousands of people even for us a therapist I was working the health clubs I was getting people in shape\nSo I Know what to do but I didn't do it until all of a sudden I says why not why do the same thing I Do it for for my clients and I did that exactly I I listen to a CD\nI'm programming my own self to look at food is only for body nutrition body maintenance repair I don't miss it and ... food becomes very boring to me\nBut wait because I've been there and everybody that has been there when you get tired of buying clothes because you can't fit into um you finally say you know what am I going to stop doing this in what am I going to start going in the other direction or what do I have to do\nEven myself here a while back when I had something I was gaining weight hide finally says and that's it\nNow's the time to change I Know what to do I talk to thousands of people even for us the therapist I was working the health clubs I was getting people in shape\nSo I Know what to do but I didn't do it until all of a sudden I says why not why do the same thing I Do it for for my clients and I did that exactly I I listen to a CD I'm programming my own\nSelf to look at food is only for about a nutrition body maintenance repair I don't miss it and ... food becomes very boring to me ah I find myself a drink and a lot of water doing a lot more physical activities and it's not that I'm forcing myself it's that I Want to do those things see that's\nThat's the thing is when you change your mindset you're not force yourself to lose weight or get off drugs all of a sudden you want to be free you want to move forward you have energy you have things to do places to go and people will see\nAnd you know what you give them a free sixty minute consultation that comes along with a CD there's nothing better there's nothing better than to try this and it can't hurt you all you have to do is give them a call\nTell them what's going on and he can tell you how we can help you that's it it's that simple you can call them at six has to fight for seven zero for for sick leave a message you know call you right back customized programs to meet their needs\nThat's it I I'd customize the program for the person not for their problem as the wise every every smoker has a different situation so if I have a hundred and smokers probably have a hundred different programs that same with weight loss same with motivation same way with drugs\nSo the thing is we got to reprogram that computer sitting on your shoulders so that you want to do these things it's not you're pushing yourself and forcing yourself no because if you do that\nYou're going to go back to your old habits we have used change your mindset and that's what we do we change your mind since so that you become a winner and you take control of your life instead of being controlled by life situation people places or things are events\nTell them what you mean by a lifetime guarantee\nLifetime otherwise we know in our life that there's gonna be situations that gets us off the focus of being in good health\nWe've all done it so the thing is is you might have to either put that CD back in or give me a call maybe in six months or six years and say hey doc I needed to know how much is is free get back in here and I love it when clients come back\nAbsolutely and you know what it cost them anything he also won't like it fails to tell what that means you know\nI don't let people fail billowing fail stay home and do your way 'cause I'm always in your head I'm always said that you can hear that voice of mine and I've I've been told\nThat so many times but the thing is you want to do these things that\nEverybody that is successful has a successful coach around them every professional has a coach whether it's for the reminder body they have a coach and that's what I become too you not just say therapists and Dr Fred I become your coach in your mind and\nEverybody says the same thing when they come in\nYeah gosh why it took me so long to get in your eyes is\nFear fear is one of his saddest things it stops people from moving for or the complacency tapes all started tomorrow I'll started next week how many times have you done that and when there's gotta be the time to do it\nAnd when you do it you finally say why it took me so long it was so simple and so easy right yeah you become successful and that\nBut the thing is you want to do these sanctions everybody that's is successful has a successful coach around them every professional has a coach whether it's for the reminder body they have a coach and that's when I become too you not just a therapist and a doctor friend I'd become your coach and your mind and\nEverybody says the same thing when they

successful\nAnd that number it's six to fight for seven zero for for six the website is hypnotic the number one dot com leave a message call and tell them what's going on where everybody's got something going on I don't care if it's depression I don't care if it's anger if you're OCD there are so many people at that issue it's not funny\nAnd sometimes people don't even know what the issue is they know what the symptom is like smoking or or depression they don't feel good of a sudden they're not feeling good more often throughout the days and throughout their weeks and all of a sudden hey they come in\nThey don't have that any longer so if you've got something going on that you're not either proud of or that you want to get rid of hey stop and see me I'm not twist your arm just stop and say hey\nYou listen for half an hour to an hour I give you a free CD you can go and think about a talk to your husband talk to your wife talk to your dog I don't care\nAt all of a sudden your dogs got really going to love it because you're going to go out for a walk with a dog dogs always want to go out earlier though no one is so hot but the thing is we put you in control of your life instead of being controlled by\nThat number to call again it's six oh two five four seven zero for for sick leave a message and just tell them hey this too and I I Know we don't always talk about every single time but the kids out there to how 'bout them we all have our children that are dealing with issues some of 'em have terrible issues they're getting a bully\nKids really have an unbroken now they're bullied not just in school or on the playground they're bullied cyber Lee yeah otherwise on the computers so the thing is if you want to have that child\nGetting in control bring 'em out but the best thing is is you comment being controlled you instead of telling their child to tell you to do not as I Do want to\nGet out there because if it's good enough for the child he out but it's good enough for you because we're never too old to learn something new\nYou went to school to learn how to do math and English and everything else nobody ever taught you how to use that in mind and that's what I Do\nAgain that number six so to fight for seven zero for for sick leave a message telling what's going on in a call you back and I'll tell you what he can do for\nYou it's not being

always always willing something we're always successful was achieving things or maybe you're a sibling that's always achieving things when you're not\nDo they think different most definitely do they do different action sure because they believe different and that's what we do we change your belief system so that you automatically start thinking different you change your perception about what your situation is and what you are and your future\nGot to get to the root cause that's what it's all about getting down deep and finding out you you're finding out what's bothering is that we can get it out and you could start being successful at what\nEven message telling what's going on in a call you back and I'll tell you what he can do for\nYou it's not being successful just every now and then or when you're focused on it's changing how you look at things change in your perception what's the difference between you and that neighbor that seems like it's always always willing something we're always successful always achieving things or maybe you're a sibling that's always achieving things when you're not\nDo they think different most definitely do they do different action sure because they believe different and that's what we do we change your belief system so that you automatically start thinking differently you change your perception about what your situation is and what you are and your future\nYou guys get to the root cause that's what it's all about getting down deep and finding out you find out what's bothering is it we get it out and you could start being small\nIt gets it each time that you have a negative it gets applied to the ... that month and by the end of the year now you're getting a check back which is what you've been talking about for what over two years now\nWith me and everybody else out in the world out there that that's how she could show you that she could save you want him a bill that you're already paying way too much\nOn and you know here's the thing some people it takes them hearing me one time Carol and they call me right away 'cause they here's something and they go I really want to talk to her and some people it takes hearing me two or three times and that's okay but you know what\nWhen I meet with my family's in my household I'm there to do my very best work for them just like I was there to help my daughter save money on a bill that she was paying way too much money on [noise] and again I couldn't help her pay the bill\nSo I didn't have any backup plan it's this is going to work and this is the way it's going to work\nAnd so when I come out to see your family and your household\n[noise] this is how I design your families now this is going to produce all the power you need ... my little fang produce your own power and pay less for it there's we've just had one of the largest increases in a PS that we've seen in years\nPeople it's not going to stop there I'm having I've made a pretty important circle of friends people that I trust because there's a lot of inaccurate information out there about ... about our power bills from the power company's ads all over TV we don't know who to believe\nSo I go and find the source that I can believe in I verified truth a trust and verifies my saying\nAnd I'm having lunch with one of the board of directors of one of the big electric companies he's become a good friend of mine in a very good source of information as therapy is going to have one of these huge increases and it's not too far off but that the other things that are going to end\n... my little thing produce your own power and pay less for it there's we've just had one of the largest increases in a PS that we've seen in years\nPeople it's not gonna stop there I'm having I've made a pretty important circle of friends people that I trust because there's a lot of inaccurate information out there about our pounds of butter power bills from the power company's ads all over TV we don't know who to believe\nSo I go and find the source that I can believe in I verified truth a trust and verifies my saying\nAnd I'm having lunch with one of the board of directors of one of the big electric companies he's become a good friend of mine in a very good source of information as her pie is going to have one of these huge increases and it's not too far off but the the other things that are going to influence our builds as these things like and I brought a little flyer\nUm prop one twenty seven and it's too complicated and complex to go into in the short time that we have Carol [noise]\nBut I'm going to be doing a town hall\nI'm the first Thursday of the ... the first Sunday of the month before the election onto the going November elections\nSo that we can have a discussion because this thing is very confusing is worded very confusing you think this person voting no I should vote yes you think this person voting yes I should vote now\nCome to the town hall go to my Web site um it's going to be the date sometimes I'm just confirming the Venus I can announce today until it's confirmed the venue but I've got a pretty much locked up [noise] um you want to know where and when and times and everything call me or go to my website and requests information to be emailed to you\nBecause prop one twenty seven and things of the lake are going to affect our power call 'em anytime people tell us we have to do something or the ... are ... a company has to do something [noise]\nThere's ... there's a there's an impact to us some somewhere along the line so I said to my family some people listening in your in your own hopeful you wanna live four to bleed and comfortably in your home on home\nReading you bought your house second to your home powers second largest expense you're going to have over your lifetime an average hopeful will spend approximately about a hundred thousand dollars in the next twenty twenty five years on their power costs\nSo the way that you don't let

extension one for six three the following program as an encore presentation [noise]\n[noise]\n\nHonestly provocative fed largely gun that's\nRight age six six four three nine five to seven seven if you want to take part in honestly provocative\nTalk it is the best conversation at our journalism glad to have you with me on this First Amendment friday night we'll get back to your calls in a moment but I wanted to talk about a shipping tribute to the United states has with China\nAnd about Donald Trump's withdrawal from that and what that says to China and whether or not they are actually listening to us Sean Higgins is a senior writer at the Washington Examiner Shaun welcome to the program\nFor having me some graft in Portland\nA very good it's good to have you on the program what's a what's going on here why why did the president do this\nWell what the president did was he signaled that he's going to be pulling out pulling out of the universal\nPostal union which is the un run the agency that basically sets rates for international meal\nOr there's been a long standing complaint that it says the rates too low for China basically it was set back in Nineteen sixty nine that rate was supposed that was set for basically developing economies and hasn't been adjusted at least not until very recently in their argument is that this amount specifically to big subsidies to try that it's part of\nIt's obviously part of a sort of broader effort the administration is doing to try and find every sort of way an ankle they can to put pressure on trying to change its trade policies and to be honest I've been very inventive about coming up with new ways to do this I mean this postal union thing as one so there has been\nUnder the radar for a long time and it's just interesting and kind of ingenious ways they found it put pressure on them\nBeyond the political pressure let's start with is Sean is there a case to be made that it's not a subsidy to China because after all the postal service loses usually half\nA billion to a billion dollars every year and while they're in it officially they're an independent government agency they haven't been making all their pension payments and I've read the G. A. O. recounts that say\nIf the postal service doesn't pay for its pensions American taxpayers will so every dime they lose while they're under charging a customer is a dime\nHistory is doing to try and find every sort of way an ankle they can to put pressure on trying to change its trade policies and to be honest with me very inventive about coming up with new ways to do this I mean this postal union thing is one something that's been under the radar for a long time and it's just an interesting kind of ingenious ways they found it put pressure on\nWell beyond the political pressure let's start with is Sean is there a case to be made that it's not as subsidy to China because after all the postal service loses usually half\nA billion to a billion dollars every year and while they're in ... officially they're an independent government agency they haven't been making all their pension payments and I've read the G. A. O. recounts that say\nIf the postal service doesn't pay for its pensions American taxpayers will so every time they lose while they're under charging a customer is a dime a or a dollar or a billion dollars that American taxpayers are going to have to pay\nIs there an argument made that were charging a fair rate to China and they shouldn't be paying more\nUm\nThat's interesting question I mean I hadn't really thought about it in those terms I Will say that uh you know the post ... there's nothing there's nothing to prevent the postal service for simply or the administration physically I'm\nIn charge in China a larger rates which is what they may in fact eventually be doing as the consequences of this administration's a decision on this side on this sort of signal the scent of wanting to China or\nThat that that it may do that and that's basically what they're attempting to do so if if the question is can we get more money coming in the U.S postal service that's actually as a viable question and something that may actually be looking to do later on down the line\nBut this also has implications for\nWell I guess for the way they're trying to compete for the United states because as I understand it the UP you this is this the United nations agency or says we're going to allow a flat rate for packages up to four point four pounds so if somebody goes on Amazon and buy something from China\nAnd you know buy something and whether they know it's coming from China or not it shipped from China\nYou have the packages for point four pounds that's two kilos their lives are then they get charged a flat rate and that that allows foreign companies to undercut us competitors who have to pay market right well at least if they're sending things by FedEx or UPS or the other carriers in this country they pay market rate um\nShouldn't shouldn't we did this does having an implication for people buying things because if you find all of a sudden that you're going to have to pay more to ship things if they're coming from China that might actually make American goods are goods from other places competitive whether or not today and the only difference could be the shipping cause right\nThat's exactly that's exactly it and I believe that sort of vehicles the administration is looking at him into a lot of business organizations in the U.S have been making you know precisely that argument that you know it's just simply unfairly trying to be able to do it this way and needs to do something differently and a lot of them are very pleased with the ministry of ... you know picking up the\nBaton on this for like ...\nWell I guess I'm interested to and the implications for the postal service I mean I don't know how many packages are coming from China but given the volume that Amazon and song I've a feeling it's probably a lot\nAnd if you you know if every one of them caused another dollar a dollar and a half to ship a that would not only have implications for U.S companies that are trying to sell to American consumers but it would it have an ... an implication for the postal service to have all of a sudden the rates went up\nTo something that's more like a market rate and they were a bit higher on a\nFew tens of millions of packages that could make a big difference\nNuts is that no you're exactly right on that point it could it could make a substantial difference I mean part of the thing well what's interesting about the Trump Administration is it\nBe able to do it this way and we need to do something differently and a lot of them are very pleased with the administration is is you know picking up the baton on this for like for a\nWhile I guess I'm interested to and the implications for the postal service I mean I don't know how many packages are coming from China but given the volume that Amazon and song I've a feeling it's probably a lot\nAnd if you you know if every one of them caused another dollar a dollar and a half to ship a that would not only have implications for U.S companies that are trying to sell to American consumers but it would it have an ... an implication for the postal service to have all of a sudden the rates went up\nTo something that's more like a market rate and they were a bit higher on a\nFew tens of millions of packages that could make a big difference\nNuts is that now you're exactly right on that point it could it could make a substantial difference I mean\nPart of the thing well what's interesting about the Trump Administration is that they are\nBasically sort of turning over all these rocks hum of issues that people haven't looked at her thought about in a long time and forcing people to you know uh to to deal with them and ... is again is another one of those sort of interesting cases where they're doing that where they're forcing because this has been something that's been going on with\nThe sort of process has been for decades in the first one to say hey wait a minute why are we doing it this way maybe we should do a different way and that's one of the interesting things about the inspiration\nWell especially because and this has gone on from sixty nine to president we've essentially had no no difference in the rates that are being charged flat rates that are being charged for shipping packages is that the is that the case or has there been some kind of inflation escalator and that over the over the last forty or fifty years\nI don't know if it's been I don't know if it's been adjusted for inflation or not I mean there's a ... I Believe the rate has remained the same whether whether that's a you know versus I I don't actually know the exact mechanism weather works as a percentage or not I'm not sure but the rate has remained consistent whether or not it it's a small percentage of Sonia\nSean you you sound like you're a bit younger than me but\nWould you like to be paying for gasoline let's say what you were paying a Nineteen sixty that if you were by gasoline at night I was mowing lawns so I was buying gasoline in Nineteen sixty nine and I know what it costs then and I know what a cause now I'd love to have Nineteen sixty nine gasoline rage or rent I remember my parents used to be a hundred dollars a month for a very nice house\nFor rent and and I'd love to be paying a hundred dollars a month to rent an apartment I'll bet a lot of other Americans would to\nWhy is it that until we get a real business man in office like Donald Trump nobody any of these administrations as a you know Bush or Clinton or or or a bomb or anyone else and said hey maybe we should bring that rate forward why are we still charging the Nineteen sixty nine right\nIt's I mean it it's that and that's a good question and the answers that\nAs with so many things is just so much easier to say I find whatever let\nLet's just let it let it be and move on to something else that somewhat more pressing um and just not deal with it I mean there's there's so many sort of things that just haven't been looked at her dressed or talked about in a long time um and this is another one of the sort of issues and there's a lot of things that they brought up and when they were talking about the\nYou know the trade you know the NAFTA deal and other things that people haven't talked about her address in a while and\nThis is in yeah I mean it's the the answer your question is\nPeople should have people should have been looking and asking these fundamental questions and there's just that sort of mindset of standard sort of Washington that never really bother to do it\nAnd what things about Trump is that he doesn't subscribe to that mindset I mean and sometimes he goes a little bit of a off the edge on some areas but other times you know take somebody who thinks that way to sort of a look at these issues and say\nYou know do we really need to do it this way I mean now that you know\nThe NAFTA negotiations for a good example I mean for a long time people there who wants to and what is going is working fine we don't need to address this really to rock the boat and Trump said no I'm going to rock the\nBoat and see what happens yeah that's exactly what it is doing that again with this\nThe thing that they brought up and when they were talking about it you know the tree you know the NAFTA deal and other things that people haven't talked about are dressed in a while and\nThis is yeah I mean it's the answer your question is\nPeople should have people should have been looking and asking you something about the questions and it's just that sort of mindset of standard sort of Washington but never really probably just do it and what things about Trump has said he\nDoesn't subscribe but mine sent me sometimes he goes a little bit of a off the edge on some areas but other times you know take somebody who thinks that way to sort of a look at these issues and say\nYou know do we really need to do it this way I mean you know with\nThe NAFTA negotiations for a good example for a long time people they're all saying what's gone it's working fine we don't need to address this really trucks Trump's if I'm going to vote and see what happens yeah that's exactly what you're doing that again with the ...\nWell ... it just kind of stunned me because I have a feeling there isn't a company out there in the private sector who doesn't say what are we charging for this is that what our competitors are charging is that what the market will bear and maybe back in Nineteen sixty nine I don't know how much stuff was getting shipped from China\nI mean before uh before next and even sort of open the open does up an open China so we'd had better relations with them I'm not sure how much stuff was getting shipped anyway probably not nearly the volume today but I have to imagine somewhere someone deep in the bowels of the U.S government\n[noise] yeah I mean other than that almost twelve million dollars I'm just under half of that is for historic assets alone so you know do that as you mentioned the lodges that cat and the places that we use and the memories that we have these parks um culture landscapes the battlefield to cemeteries all of that I'm\nI'm all of that as a part of that that um that maintenance backlog\nNow let me ask you this because I've always wanted to run the numbers my wife and I buy an annual pass every year and I think it's Seventy five or eighty bucks and there's a very good deal if you're just going to go to one of the parts one time on one day every year I think you pay\nThirty bucks but if you buy Seventy five or eighty dollar pass and maybe a little bit more now\nThat they would uh you know that that let you go to any national park you want all year long and it's a it's a pretty good deal and I feel\nThat part of this bill should be paid by everybody in America because they're available to everybody but those of us who want to use the parks we pay a little bit more and I don't think that's necessarily wrong I don't think the visitors should pay the entire ... nor do I think the taxpayer should pay the whole tab\nHis her away and I keep wanting twelve billion so we spent a billion a year on top of whatever we're spending now in the poor maintenance we're doing right now we we would catch up and about a decade which wouldn't be a bad gold shoot for denies doing five years instead of ten where you could do that\nHow many people visit all of the national parks in a way that would cause them to pay an entry fee or show their past you know\nIt's that's that's a great question I Know that millions of people go to the parks here and I think what this restore our parks um legislation to protest\nThey would uh you know they don't let you go to the national park you want all year long and it's a pretty good deal and I feel\nThat part of this bill should be paid by everybody in America because they're available to everybody but those of us want to use the ... paid a little bit more and I don't think that's necessarily wrong I don't think the visitors to pay the entire ... nor do I think the taxpayers to pay the whole tab\nUser away and I keep wanting twelve billion ... billion a year on top of whatever we're spending now in the ... right now\nWe we would catch up and about a decade which wouldn't be a bad gold shoot for be nice to do it in five years instead of town where you could do that how many people visit all of the national parks you know where that would cause them to pay an entry for your show their past you know\nI'm I'm it's that's that's a great question I Know there are millions of people go to the parks here and I think what this restore our parks um legislation does which has bipartisan support is that it it doesn't\nYou know draw or create an additional burden on the taxpayer and in fact the six point five billion dollars which the legislation proposes um\nTowards is almost twelve billion dollar deficit over five years comes from a federal middle revenues onto this is on showing offshore oil and gas I'm so these are things that we um those funds that are already there but they're not earmark on right now for national parks are allocated to other programs but I'm a ...\nA lot of federal budget expert either monitor but if the if money wasn't going to the park to would go to the general treasury and it'd be available for all the other stuff the federal government bonds right\nYeah well the way that these funds are I mean what we are proposing is to to reallocate these funds to to the park so it's not necessarily um you know pulling drawing down our adamant increased burden on the taxpayer and what it does is it is to\nIdentifying a pot of money that we haven't thought about um that could benefit the national parks and I and I think you know what that does of course is with this um six point six and a half billion dollar influx of fun and I think on the back in and then you know\nYou talk and finding out it's always return on investment right so investing this as a country or what are we going to get back for it and you know to that I Will answer me will will have the you know the statue of liberty I Will be preserved and that has a a backlog\nOf maintenance backlogs right now Ellis Island and we know how important um you know that was a stopping point in our\nAmerican story um you know that places like the Little Rock Central High school um in in in Arkansas and that is a historic site and brown v board of education at that you know these are the historic places that tell our story and so we have a ... we have places we can go to talk about um who we are as a country and to get\nTo the numbers of things I mean um we um had an analysis done by the cabinets group and they found that if\nThe if this legislation passed it would create a hundred and ten thousand infrastructure related jobs and so that directly impacts local and caught economies at these national parks are part of and so I Would say you know\nBy redirecting these funds it's a it's an immediate return on investment um for with these local communities can get and the job they create um by just restoring places that we already know hum are important to to who we are as a country\nTo monitor who's opposing\n[noise] up you know\nUp right now there's a bipartisan support so us on on\nBoth sides I think right now we're we're trying\nTo get through and we're hoping to get this legislation passed in the next month or two so after the election um to to really get boots on the ground and get to work around are around us so we're we're you know kind\nOf caught into um the the bill is now in the legislation is now in sub committee and it's coming out of that soon but we you know or need to the Congress to act right now um to to get this passed for us\nSo it's something that they've already got by\nYou know by redirecting these funds it's a it's an immediate return on investment for what these local communities can get and the job they create um by just restoring places that we already know hum are important to to who we are as a country\nSo Monica who's opposing\nUp you know\nUp right now there is a bipartisan support so it's on on\nBoth sides I think right now we're we're trying\nTo get through and we're helping 'em to get this legislation passed or in the next month or two after the election um to to really get boots on the ground and get to work around are around us and where were you know kind\nOf caught into um the the deal is now and and the legislation is now in subcommittee it's coming out of that soon but we you know I Need to to Congress to act right now uh to to get this passed rest\nSo it it's something that if they've already got bipartisan support it should be a done deal done is anybody playing politics with the same World War not doing that until you do something else\nYou know I'm I'm I Would say I'm I'm sure that day is the case [laughter] but but I you know I Would also argue that yeah I I I'm a big huge preservation is in fact yeah of course I work for the national trust 'em you know but you know preservation as a as a as a bipartisan I'm\nA you know it's it's good for Republicans and Democrats I guess good outside\nThe all clear about our heritage I just wanted I think it would be hard for somebody to oppose it on\nA true but I I just figure on Capitol Hill they don't even agree to go to lunch I'll go to lunch voted for my farm bill while I'm not going on with you unless you vote

across the country\nNow international and national polls show the ... about twenty percent more Republican than it is a Democrat and folks you know the Republicans are conservative tend to vote more than liberals so why do they see Texas as a potential blue state because of election fraud\nAnd because they're cheating we're gonna have to work harder and got the Washington Times you name it\nAll reporting on Democrats public cleave registering illegal aliens do vote\nNow illegal aliens while there's not a big deal usually folks vulgar names of dead folks\nUsually homeless people by bus around to doing that is well no but they're telling you illegals that it's okay and that it's there right now and they have to make it official because the average illegal doesn't want to commit a crime actually on average there to sharing legally spilled which tend to be picked up\nAnd show the extent of their criminal activity is is is generally just wanting a better life\nBut the Democrats are

articles him where they Alex ... still on Twitter despite the ban\nOh we've got MSN reporting we'll see you on that hit him off get everything off\nBut now you can't even make a joke that perhaps we'll all be arrested her doing now is it that you're no longer than a man by who can't criticize\nYou hit that come in the day but I could be correct and I am currently a real rep toyed fourteen years old on the planet and diarrhea\nHillary Clinton's\nRoyal any part in a whole other criticized uh what do you think Mr night\nWhile I think if we could show that she was at least zero point zero nine percent reptilian MBNA then should qualified just like Elizabeth Warren qualifies for being a Cherokee but no Alex ... you know we look at the Elizabeth Warren bang it ... should have been considered to be ...\nAnd I thought it was perfect for the Bible and read that story saying that after looking at Elizabeth Warren's thing ... had her own DNA tests that she's had those conservative July I'm not a hundred percent reptilian DNA I'm only fifty percent now what what are the Daily Beast did\nWas really reprehensible on a number of levels are they came out yesterday at five twenty six pm eastern standard time\nOr they came out that shows that it's been for wars that lower permanently banned from Twitter in September ... moved seemed to be a death blow for input wars just weeks before they make a crop of platforms like YouTube and Facebook now of course they don't mention the fact\nThat YouTube and Facebook and apple recruiting they did it within hours of each other all of them doing it at the same time and then of course they also included with the press and we saw this pattern happened again last week\nUh we had another eight hundred alternative media sites that were shut\nIt was it should have been considered to be satire\nAnd I thought it was perfect for the Bible invaded that story saying that after looking at Elizabeth Warren's thing to equate Hillary had her own DNA tests that she's had those conservatives are lying I'm not a hundred percent reptilian DNA I'm only fifty percent now what what are the Daily Beast it\nWas really reprehensible on a number of levels are they came out yesterday at five twenty six pm eastern standard time\nOr they came out and said our shows that it's been for wars that lower permanently banned from Twitter in September ... moved seemed to be a death blow for info wars just weeks before the makeup of platforms like YouTube and Facebook now of course they don't mention the fact\nThat YouTube and Facebook and apple recruiting they did it within hours of each other all of them doing it at the same time and then of course they also included with the press and we saw this pattern happened again last week\nUh we had another eight hundred alternative media sites that were shut down Facebook and Twitter within hours of each other the press it already been notified the press already had their stories ready to run just like they did with us\nSo they're they're wringing their hands of the Daily Beast saying well they should be down but they're still up\nHow are they still have power they still are communicating with people and how do we get them off for the remaining social media sites and so they then site me they said in fact two months after Jones and infowars are supposedly ... number of accounts remain live tweeting on Tuesday the Twitter account for infowars real new show\nWith hosts David night promoted nights claim that Hillary Clinton is quote fifty percent reptilian DNA\nSo they put that out there as if I'm taking that seriously you know it is a satire or Elizabeth Warren's claims are satire but Alex the real amazing thing about this to me is that it was the Daily Beast that was attacking Danny Williams when he was asking a real question a Bill Clinton\nAnd that was please take a DNA test so I can know who my father as you've paid a highway patrol in Arkansas every Christmas they would deliver cash my mother my mother who was black says that you are my father I looked like you I'm lighter skinned and my sister\nCan I please have some closure on this will you please take a DNA test either a ... a put this to rest and showed that it's not true or then to uh let me know that I've got a father and do and you know ... will come into the family and he was vilified\nVilified by the press there in that press conference especially by this reporter from the Daily Beast that she was so bad Alex ... you remember that it was live streamed Iran and for wars\nI at one point attacked her instead of talking to Danny Williams I said how dare you treat him like this is who are you and it's and I'm David night from ... in Fort Worth and this is the Daily Beast shutting down one land\nOn that ... expand their like how dare they may have more communicate because they want to be a whole lot about us and we want violence and that we want to attack the press\nOh hey call from blowing up the White House wall Rosie O'Donnell call for the military and take crop up at the White House while they say hash tag ... Republican hall they cannot bear and ... all they say all of this insane crap they want to silence everywhere\nAnd then when you read and say it's a satire article I've seen the video replay it later\nAnd he any joke about a satire article and make jokes have and misrepresent that were saying and we've only rep toy that Ryan hang on that not only said that's not what we do it's like I said I say\nThat there is a Martian motivational flame children have offered a million dollars this is a war of mouth from Star Trek not real into health everybody knows that\nThey'll probably say in fact the last time I didn't look like five years ago they said don't things lizards that rail and depressed up like one of the show [laughter] their own readers don't get that power this is an incredible mental illness for\nA one these people are doing and it just gets more and more and more insane David and again do you agree with me that ahead of the ...\nWell they say all of this insane crap they want to silence everywhere\nAnd then when you read and say it's a satire article not seen the video replay it later and he any joke about a satire article and make jokes they misrepresented were saying and we've only rep toy derive from that not only said that's not what we do it's like I said I say\nThat there's a Martian Monday slate and tell her I'm offered a million dollars or more miles from Star Trek this is not real into health everybody knows that\nThey'll probably say in fact the last time I didn't look like five years ago they said don't think was or rail and pressed up like one of the show their own readers don't get that power this incredible mental illness\nOf what these people are doing and it just gets more and more and more insane David and\nAgain do you agree with me that ahead of the midterms they're planning something really really big but they're everywhere saying Trump's going to cause violence I here's one out here\nAre just today there's just tons of each a shame that Trump's going to get a bunch of people killed Trump wants to meeting a dead a vox editor Trump supporters will murdered journalist I mean it's just incredible they're the ones calling from ...\nWell Alex you know they could be laying the foundation for that but let me tell you something they have overthrown our government and our foundation and our constitution and our individual rights if we allow them to get away with shutting down the free press and free speech free speech\nIs separate from the freedom of the press is bad enough to take away the freedom of the press for what they're doing on social media is taking away the building of people\nTo read the press and then comment on what they agree with what they disagree with and that's what they are taking down and they understand that satire I I honestly don't think they're that stupid I honestly don't think the Twitter is that stupid they did it within a couple of hours of this\nNo they don't know what your frog David and again yeah Twitter is used more than telephones now in many areas or\nAs the head of Penn and teller came out and shed that it's more power from the courts now show they show on shows and then they demonize this and they the famous and we don't\nHave an way to respond back where post legal notices are challenged their lives and they are abusing their authority big tax out of control even the head of Google Now admits they're censoring people and says yeah we're helping China he told Congress in a letter last week censorship can help the government it's a good service were offering\nMhm yeah and we can use its outside of China as well and then we saw the good sense or document that was not Breitbart saying that we're not going to follow\nThe model but has been the historically an America where we have a free marketplace of free speech we're going to follow the European idea that we're going to have dignity instead of liberty well that's not European idea really that's a BF Skinner a behavioral modification idea he wrote the book or\nA beyond freedom and dignity that's really where they're going they're trying to modify our behavior\nThat's right and they take your popular Twitter account down very genteel professional show you out and then a lie about you and say you believe space aliens runs range and that does Hillary earlier rap toy and engage in fake news flawed against you when the silence you that use the criminal activity we're dealing with\nWhether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula for just one an alternative painful wars life have the formula for you\nAnd engage in fake news flawed against you when the silence you that is the criminal activity we're dealing with\nWhether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula for just one an alternative painful wars life have the formula for us\nThat would be a step up for I sleep\nThere'd be a reptilian space lizard\nShowing says it's satire he said it'd be a step up for it had to update and apologize hey we're satire sight but everybody's getting really upset about dish yeah people are now being banned for covering your satire and saying it's satire and then lying and saying you didn't say at satire\n[noise] but I never even sits directly said that there were Martian colleagues wouldn't ... children on them\nThey just made it up at why not because of that can silence you than\nThey can say whatever they want about you that's the other equation of censorship David he'll be back tomorrow where people can censor for now am till eleven AM infowars dot com forward slash show and that's why it's so critical ... emailed her friends and family daily unsafe first women under attack here's what they don't want you to hear\n... friends and family are articles the live feed simple wars dot com or slide show works the pages we posted shape what the topic the top top unusual people understand this she's urging they're trying to shut us down out of the election and only by listeners\nSpreading the word signing up for free newsletter and then sending that email on a and force dot com forward slash newsletter only by doing that will we get around the sensors David\nAbsolutely Alex and you know we're talking about DNA as I said before the serious question about DNA was shut down at that press conference by the daily beach though when daily daily Williams wanted to know if a Bill Clinton would take a DNA test to verify or to deny his fraternity but of course we'll talk a little bit about the DNA of the Daily Beast\nOr it was just a few days ago that we pointed out that the Chelsea Clinton sets on the\nBoard of the company that owns the Daily Beast and she's been rewarded with six point six million dollars for doing so so I guess that makes a a Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton part of the DNA of the Daily Beast is their ancestors showed up there and then the grandmother of the Daily Beast\nBut Alex I Want to say something about Twitter because you know we've had the situation with a\nA fair con coming out and saying uh Jews or he's not anti Semitic he's editor might then they said well that doesn't violate our rules because you didn't say that about a specific person they're saying that I violated the rules because I had targeted harassment of a specific person in other words they'll re Clinton and you know being a reptile\nNow so I figure they're not saying it's\nHis fraternity but of course we'll talk a little bit about the DNA of the Daily Beast or it was just a few days ago that we pointed out\nThat the Chelsea Clinton sites on the board of the company that owns the Daily Beast and she's been rewarded with six point six million dollars for doing so so I guess that makes a a Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton part of the DNA of the Daily Beast is their ancestors show the parent and the grandmother of the Daily Beast\nBut Alex I Want to say something about Twitter because you know we've had the situation with a\nA fair con coming out and saying uh Jews or he's not anti Semitic he's editor might then they said well that doesn't violate our rules because you didn't say that about a specific person they're saying that I violated the rules because I had targeted harassment of a specific person in other words Hillary Clinton and you know being a reptile\nNow so I figure they're not saying it's bullying truck if she calls me a dark caught in the worst person in the world\nBut yeah I I Can't say anything bad about her\nAnd she's serious about that but let me you know when we had this a statement this interview with wired magazine that Jack Dorsey had talking about Twitter CEO of Twitter\nAnd he said all that stuff about us being the free speech wing of the free speech party that was just a joke you know they become a joke themselves but they went on to say a lot of people come to Twitter they don't actually see an app or service\nThat kind of looks like it's a public square and they have the same sort of accept the expectations of a public square and that is what we have to make sure they get right also make sure that everyone feels safe and that public square so he uses the term public square three times when he testified before Congress to use the term public square five times Alex we have a Supreme Court decision\nThat says Nineteen forty six marshals Alabama that if you are in the public square even if it is privately owned that they can't stop your speech and the public square we've let a Supreme Court decision roe v Wade killed tens of millions of babies but we ignore this Supreme Court decision that would protect us from having the public square killed by\nAll there is no doubt that they operate and they have liability protection because they are a public square and jump back in the center publishers censor us if Congress just acts the president actions over for them for whatever you do folks they can't stop you

drove up to the it's called the ... river country\nAnd that was developed into a pharmaceutical drugs for cancer treatment and it's been very effective at that had a lot of success with it over the years it's a it's a big seller\nAnd a tax solved\nA drug originally derived from the EU treaty that's how I originally got involved in the ... business was supplying a pharmaceutical company with the ... from the huge tree and that's where they originally extract the extracted the drug before\nThey figured out how to synthesize it\nAnd when they did set aside that um they made the announcement and early nineties for uh we work for them for three years Ninety One Ninety to Ninety three and a Ninety four they announced that [noise] excuse me they had a\nSet the size it so I knew enough at that point and I had been studying the at no botany or the ... tree and the Pacific northwest and how the Native Americans use that and\nI started making tea out of the needles myself I had heard some stories of people in the northwest making a tea out of the needles from the huge tree and creating themselves for cancer was success\nSo I was referred down to the by medical center in Tijuana, Mexico by some folks up here some friends in Montana who had been down there\nAnd been treated for cancer successfully and what they specialize in at the ... medical center which is also known as the ... clinic ... is ...\nNinety to Ninety three and\nA Ninety four they announced that [noise] excuse me they had a set the size it\nSo I knew enough at that point and I had been studying the at no botany or the ... tree and the Pacific northwest and how the Native Americans use that\nAnd I started making tea out of the needles myself I had heard some stories of people in the northwest making a T the

down there and been treated for cancer successfully and what they specialize in at the ... medical center which is also known as the ... clinic\nNut is non toxic cancer treatments\nAnd they've been very successful at it over the years we've been working with them for twenty four years now and I have seen\nLiterally hundreds of patients down there that have gone down there in advanced stages and they got it turned around and they were healthy\nYeah and then out of that use me situation uh you probably take and a\nSin to these patients that go down to the bio medical center the Montana you as a a additional product that the doctors recommend down there that's about eighty to eighty five percent correct rough\n[noise] yeah uh about eighty to eighty five percent of their patients get the you tip capsules included in their protocols\nAnd we we get an email ... Monday through friday every day from the clinic was the name in the address the patient and what the doctors want us to send them and we ship the products directly to the patients from Montana\nRight and you ship the mud and you to Australia to South Korea to Canada and probably Europe too is that correct\nAll over the world the only country we've never been able to get into with through the post office was Germany they have a highly regulated herbal a system there they they regulate or flight pharmaceutical companies\nYes yeah yeah in fact that's what you find on every corner over there is a job and of course some of the names are a little different and you do need a prescription so uh yeah it is a highly regulated in and they're not going to take something or like this through their mail systems so\nUh that's too bad because I'm sure there's people from Germany that have been over to the biomedical centered on your Tijuana and I'll tell you that is very simple to go there and uh\nLater on we'll get some information on on the biomedical center and Jennifer you had to\nCall yes I did I had a call and the caller wanted to know Roger ... time did you know seen because I Know that when you are diagnosed from a medical doctor which cancer and the ... medical center also recommends taking up to nine cats so I stay in that\nStandard can you take more should you take last what about the Kenyan and what is right because I Know not everybody has seen what would you recommend rats\nThe nine capsules a day a dose aids was developed by the doctors through years of experience down at the bio medical center and at three in the morning create noon and three in the evening time with meals with a K some people uh\nWill bump up to twelve the most I've ever heard of anybody taking was a lady in New York through that stage\nYou know seen because I Know that when you are diagnosed from a medical doctor with cancer and the ... medical center also recommend taking up to nine capsules I stay in that\nStandard can you take more should you take last what about that scene in and what is right 'cause I Know not everybody gets the same what would you recommend rats\nThey nine capsules a day or do said was developed by the ... through years of experience down at the ... medical center and that's three in the morning create their own and three in the evening time with meals with a okay some people uh\nWill bump it up to twelve the most I ever heard of anybody taken was a lady in New York to that stage for breast cancer if he was taking a sixteen a day\n... she got very aggressive with it but last I heard she was okay in the cancer wasn't there anymore and she was still alive that's been many many years ago\nBut if somebody's just using the capsule says are preventative like what Terry does is two to three days it\nSufficient\nYes that's about what I'd taken the capitals are so small very easy to do even a senior citizens can take those with ease and uh [noise] we do have some information about bio medical center and uh\nThe u._s. telephone number six one nine four O. seven seven eight five eight six one nine four zero seven seven five eight you call those are numbers\nThey will tell you how to um possibly get a hotel room how to get picked up on the California side of the border a chicken directly right down to the bio medical center and even picked up after your a day is over\nIt's about medical center in a bus you back across the border in the medical line which will save you about an hour and a half to get back to cross the border\nWhen I was down there a couple of years ago to look and see and meet the owner\nUm we took the bus on the way back to the band stretch ban it took us about an hour to get through customs because we're in the medical line which they do have a a\nMuch easier ... grass out of Mexico into the country\nSo it must have been ten or twelve fourteen lines of traffic mhm\nCrossing from a Tijuana into San Diego so it's a super busy place however you can drive across the border and uh I tell you what you just drive across the board because there's absolutely nothing stopping you are there are cameras so I imagine they could react really quickly\nBut you could just about three miles over the border when you get to the bio medical center\nI went there to find out hey if it was legit\nAnd I walked away thinking that\nIf I ever knew to decide the tuition that the place that I Would go\nThis is the places I'd recommend to my family and friends to go if they ever wants to treat a cancer and do it

the bottom medical center at then breast and ovarian and cervical cancers\nOr prostate cancer that's one place where really signed non small cell lung cancer and lymphoma this\nAnd that was they used they even included in leukemia protocols\nSo it's got a pretty broad a application to several different types of cancers\nThe only one that it doesn't seem to be as effective on as far comas um sometimes that well sometimes it ... it depends on the individual and how they respond and I think their diet has a lot to do with it in those situations but the garden anonymous melanoma is a\nAre

could be somebody that I could partner with the tell everybody what you do out there\nWell heck millionaires so I'm the kind of back story of how I got here as I grew up in farm in Nebraska right no conversation about money that whole thing that most people grow up with a K. and then I'm\nJust decided you really commit my when I read thinking grow richest Seventeen and I thought oh my gosh there's a way to get rich and not let this you know work hard\nYou know work out of life and um did a lot of work with the rich dad a community um and then in two thousand four wrote my first well spoke with Jake Oliver loves when I'm really well and McGraw Hill found me\nGave me a huge huge huge retainer and said well you write how you create millionaire so Nineteen Ninety nine with my millionaire year I did it in real estate and gas and oil which a lot of people rich don't realize um gas and oil is an eighty five percent depreciation schedule everybody needs in their portfolio so I became a millionaire and then just kept doing it uh making\nOther people millionaires in real estate and then the guy how civil rights about how you do it and I said I'm a high because I just do it well when you have to write down a process you gotta like al ... got to be duplicated ball so we committed all of two thousand five\nInch or two thousand six\nReally really documenting how do people become millionaires and there is a system there is a process it's not difficult and we just ramped up our game I hit five New York times best seller is year after year after year and you know got a massive following in every continent but Antarctica\nAnd then if you're serious about it we're we know how to do it we did three five years for the majority of people who work and you know is their crop out\nYou know take all the real stuff doesn't work well I Would I Would challenge that person to get on the phone and say you don't work you just want to sit on your house and do nothing now what I Love about this emergency meeting you is\nKnow you don't it's not you don't have the have you been in real estate well actually I don't have tenants I don't have\nAnd then the got health or write about how you do it and I said I'm a high because I just do it well when you have to write down a process you got it's got a system it's gotta be duplicated bull so we committed all of two thousand five\nInch or two thousand six really really documenting how do people become millionaires and there is a system there is a process it's not difficult and we just wrapped up our game I hit five New York times best seller is year after year after year and you know got a massive following in every continent but Antarctica\nAnd then get you're serious about it we're we know how to do it and we did three five years for the majority of people who work and you know is their crop out\nAnd say well world stuff doesn't work well I Would I Would challenge that person to get on the phone and say you don't work\nYou just want to sit on your house and do nothing now what I Love about this emergency meeting you is you know you don't it's not you\nDon't have the have you been in real estate right just like I don't have tenants I don't have mortgages that you know it's such a different strategy and like you said more millionaires have been made in this space and I think also um heavily in the green rush Canada space I think\nWe're in the greatest from her life yeah yeah and then you say ... ... um that it's that\nRings true to me and I say this all the time it's not hard to make money but it's hard to keep if you take it a step further though it's not it's not hard to become a millionaire is what you do when you get their rights there's this process and with from the get go day one\nOf making a plan and that's what you do your people write you set on a plan with them and then you work with them you make sure that they have everything behind them so if anything happens like emergencies et cetera that are covered right\nWell they're covered if they have and they pay attention I mean what most people biggest problem in life and business if they're an entrepreneur is most people don't follow through\nRight and so you know once we start to plan you got to follow through with the economy is starting to shift if Trump makes another announcement of whether it's the cannabis space or the wall or digital currency the SEC makes like you just got to pay attention I think most people don't pay attention\nThey want the park and pray methods around the park my money that's going to work out and I've ever have to do anything so I'm regrets and you saw it and ... if you don't want to learn than I'm not your girl I'm not I'm we're not done for you uh were a do it

people who cannot just using it gives us a lot on how the child gets it you know you can learn it and the biggest thing is to thank you if you care about someone else and you're curious about someone else\nMight ask them questions so what do you do how do you do why do you do that it should be engaged with somebody else's life instead of your own problems in your own drama\nThat anybody can learn I liked that\nKerry and care and you'll learn it just it just to come in natural and then it's not a mistake rehearsed because there are some people who I have to train it they just actually\nIt doesn't occur to them to give a shit about anybody else but right now right at it I guess somebody buying your business you know product or service you're never going to raise capital\nLike you you have to care about somebody else and you got it curious about somebody else so anybody can learn those I think you know I master fleet trained obviously I mean I get a lot of money to get trained to

to worry that I ah\nThat I was too enthusiastic and my descriptions of it to people who elevated expectations and I don't worry about that anymore because what I've discovered is that\nA regardless of what I say about it actually going through the museum a exceeds whatever descriptions I've given people about it it's a very very special place um and it's a it's a wonderful thing to have it here in the valley\nYeah it is you know um my co host here as well you with him and museum show Salah moaning share with me and uh I don't think he's ever met\nYou okay and the Mets met somebody up there that he's got a an assistant or somebody that I gave all the information to a while back and she was released we all wish I could remember her name she was\nLike well I'm I think it might have been ... she's a but a Beagle you and I talked a little about this last time I was on the show true yeah\nUm it's a\nIt's an amazing place I'm not sure if your if your guests if your listeners know um but there's an exhibit for every single country in the world when that museum and it's really you know it's a musical instrument museums so it's about\nThe musical instruments to those various countries but I don't much deeper level it really is a museum that uh showcases the cultures of the world through the music of those cultures in what really puts it over the top\nOr the videos that are that are on all of these exhibits there's a video monitor on a every exhibit three hundred and fifty or so and the curators have a source to about thirty five hundred video clips\nOf people playing the music and those various countries and cultures in the context in the indigenous context of the country and do you wear headphones as you walk through the headphones or why pies you walk up to an exhibit you automatically start to hear the music coming from those screens\nOr as\nUm I had a a friend who was blind musician who went through it and he said that he was the most extraordinary museum experience he'd ever had and he thought his head was going to explode [laughter] personally at that time that it's even a museum that people without sight could appreciate\nYou know and and I had the opportunity to take Stevie Wonder through the museum a short time after that and then I and I realized that was hold true he was just\nLocked into every exhibits fascinated by\nFive hundred video clips of people playing the music and those various countries and cultures in the context in the indigenous context of the country and\nYou you were headphones as you walk through the headphones a wide pies you walk up to an exhibit you automatically start to hear the music coming from those screens or as\nUm I had a friend who was blind musician who went through it and he said that it was the most extraordinary museum experience he'd ever had and he thought his head was going to explode [laughter] personally at that time that it's even a museum that people without sight could appreciate\nYou know and then I had the opportunity to take Stevie Wonder through the museum a short time after that but then I and I realized that was hold true he was just\nLocked into every exhibits asked me if I have\nNo low when you walk me through there and it's been a while what really attracted my attention was what you were talking about the instrumentation from different countries are so unique I mean yeah\nI I couldn't imagine what these instruments war you had to see them they're really on the chest quite unique and\nUnique and at the same time all the cultures make ends you know what's interesting though the similarities to that every country has a string instrument usually we make them out of the same materials all over the world would and uh ... sometimes stone and metal and a\n... but we all we we make these instruments that are very similar to one another and then they kind of shift from one place to another over time like bagpipes originally came out of one corner\nOf Europe and then spread across Europe is the migration that's happened and ended up as the primary interest is the instrument of\nScotland and Ireland and but at the same time they're very much a part of the some European cultures\nOr um that is a rational wait a minute [laughter] the bagpipes are getting rain just write your blowing the are going to do what goats skin and squeeze in it to get the sound to come out and until it's all up and running to pressure it's got some awesome sounds that can make if you don't know what you're doing\nBut hey you know low and they got all these shows and stuff over there because you also have the theater we were hoping that maybe you could tell some people like what times those shows are and what you've got coming up\nAbsolutely um we are ah ah we have this year we will

hour class um if it's a refresher or if you just want to get your Arizona permit after you've got another permit from another state we offer a four hour class which is actually more five actually five hour class really what we call it a four hour class\nA and that is just me covering long legal aspects of gun ownership and gun usage and the state of Arizona\nSo we offer both of those ... we

that you said because when you say them in a little bit of a legal um you know verbiage uh people may not pick it up quite like they need to\nLike that happened I got you went to we sang outlets clarify when\nYou say that they have to have their weapon it can carry a concealed a lot of people don't realize that uh things you see in the movies like where the guy opens his coat and shows the guy but he's arguing with his gun that's an illegal move\nThey bought a CAT scan is the wet than if you're in an argument with somebody 'cause you've just got out a way to the argument with that exposure there are things like that people need to know that are in these laws that will help them\nBe safe and the way they go about the escalation of an event that if it like you said God Forbid leads to having to draw your weapon you need to know what what steps are required to be covered and following the rules in such a an instance so I'm Glad that you think that\nAt Lincoln my class and

confrontation with the cabin proof\nAnd you could spend a year in prison he's going to be a prohibitive possess or convicted twenty nine year old ... adjusting Riley ... was on southwest flight eight five nine he sat next on on identified woman right before the takeoff he put his arm on her leg\nAnd when she refused his advances forcibly tried to play with the with her so this is one I Would have punched him in his throat and kicked him in his crank and stumped on him until they had to land the plane because I Would chicken is but\nAh she tried to make them stop his actions he allegedly pulled on her sweater tried to ask her to go out finally flight attendants intervene and moved to a new seat he filled and stop the harassment when he tried to approach her again he got into a confrontation with the cabin crew a he said that she was flirting with him they think he was under the influence of drugs\nBut he apparently had a criminal record in the history of violence I'm not kidding you\nI ... world one real quick story sitting on a plane one time and I was in a window seat I hate when disease I like to sit in the aisles because I like to control the day I'll accept\nAnd uh somebody I felt something called and claiming touch my elbow and I turned around I Swear hands just guy it was some little skinny hipster dude who had his grocery dirty naked feet on my arm writes in his toe touched my elbow I wasn't I wasn't even going to demonstrate courtesy a turned around I said if you don't move your feet I'm going to punish them off [noise]\nHe looked at me like I was insane and I said I mean it and he finally moved to the end he didn't touch him again and I had to use another brand new one white because they wise everything down to write that down to wipe that part of my arm right down in case my elbow touched it again and the white my elbow off I Will punch your feet right the hell off your ankles if you touch me with them\nEspecially on a plane Michael ... backs off his Texas resist almost rally a Trump is having a rally at six thirty today in Texas a and a Michael ... he was going to hold a counter resistance rally but because he's having some tax problems\nLike apparently he was like millions I Will talk about that coming up or they're not gonna yeah that could he probably was only going to attract tens of people\nThat's why nobody nobody wants to go out of the guys of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez the males really on and Joaquin Castro does that defeated nowadays is like a blueprint for defeating global warming\nNot even making this up this is an actual legitimate thing that she had said she said quote that we talk about ... at the central dressed and the last time we really had a really major at the central throw around World War two and so we've been here before and we have a blueprint of doing this before\nShe legit compared it to not I'm not even kidding you\nNot even getting so nobody won the mega millions thing\nCan you believe this it's going to be two billion dollars\nThis school raised the two billion now that's not even all of it to the ball is it six hundred million I don't even I don't gamble and I don't I don't\nPlay the lottery I made my husband get lottery tickets and he complained about it the entire time and said it was a tax on stupidity and they said well I guess you got to pay it sometime so\nThe Powerball jak part of the six hundred and twenty million the mega million in its right now well the last measurement was at one point six billion they say it's going to be up to about two million or two billion I'm Sorry two billion with a beat\nAre you going to get your ticket\nShe legit compared it to not I'm not even kidding you not even getting so nobody won the mega millions thing\nCan you believe this it's going to be two billion dollars\nThat school raising two million now that's not even all of it has a ball in the next hundred million I don't even I don't gamble\nAnd I don't I don't play the lottery I made my husband get lottery tickets any complained about it the entire time and said it was a tax on stupidity\nAnd they said well I guess I got to pay it sometime so now the Powerball jak part of the six hundred and twenty million the mega million in its right now while the last measurement was at one point ... billion they say it's going to be up to about two million\nOr two billion I'm Sorry two billion with a beat\nAre you going to get your ticket\nAnd they have a lot more coming up later that the caravan\nOf\nBecause they got to get their feet\nIt got to get their feet\nSo everybody that they they go through and they pay the sea\nSo I Can't imagine\nAnd many other places at the southern border\nAnd I can't imagine how that's going to work he notes that they have to go through about twelve hundred miles of a through Mexico\nAnd a lot of that because they're on the western side geographically speaking you know a lot of that goes right through some of the heart most hardcore controlled\nA drug cartel the\n... a sin to lower cartel and some of the other cartels down there\nThat um they're on the eastern side or sorry the western side\nThat some really seriously cartel controlled places that they're going to be going through I Can't imagine them not being exploited\nI just can't imagine and find a way although\nThe less than that it's all women and children there are some\nWomen who looks suspiciously like him in a lot of them they look just like\nMan many many many many many men\nI saw more men and I thought women and children\nCame and let's say there is ten thousand listen there's only five thousand but not one hundred percent of those people are good people there there is a faction of those people that are there to take advantage of those\nThat are making the travel for some reason so you know for Democrats to support this and to continue to be a beacon in a magnet for people like this to show up illegally is actually harmful to their own life\nSide that some really seriously cartel controlled places that they're going to be going through I Can't imagine them not being exploited\nI just can't imagine and by the way although\nThe less than that it's all women and children there are some\nWomen who looks suspiciously like I'm In a lot of them they look just like\nMan many many many many many men\nI saw more men and I thought women and children\nCame and let's say there is ten thousand listed it was only five thousand but not one hundred percent of those people are good people there there is a faction of those people that are there to take advantage of those\nThat are making the travel for some reason so you know for Democrats to support this and to continue to be a beacon in a magnet for people like this to show up illegally because actually harmful to their own life\nWell yeah I mean and they contribute to\nThe human trafficking\nIt's it's I mean because you're going to what is it but some of the border patrol agents told me that they would carry a plan B\nFor some of these ... little girls that become a little girls that would come across I heard some horror stories and I'm not even gonna repeat here on air\nUm for some of the border agents\nAnd some of the chiefs down there who am I have spoken to face to face whenever I've been down near the border and I\nMean it's amazing to think that the stuff happens in twenty teens it is amazing to think that this habit\n... sick or is the fact that the media would rather ... says Trump being evil and not accepting these caravans or whatnot as opposed to what really goes on to these ... I think\nAbout it like if these people\nBecause they said that they wanted they they were trying to say that they want an embassy in Mexico city where you're going to have to fill out the paperwork and go through all of that well they didn't want to wait for the processing time\nDo you think that the processing time if they if they make it to the U.S border is going to be any easier or any faster\nThan what they saw when they were at the border between Guatemala and Mexico\nHardly doubt it\nNow the president has said look this is a national emergency here\nUh they are the Caribbean has grown inside the president says that it's a national emergency\nAnd he they in the meanwhile they've they've they have successfully crossed into Mexico they regrouped\nThe Mexican ... failed to turn any of them back basically\nThat he has said he's ready to send troops to the border\nBecause it's a national emergency emergency and that it is you know honestly also how or does everyone even have proper documentation cetera et cetera et cetera\nIt is I've read in some instances it the caravan as either a mile or two miles long\nAnd for the most part they print been pretty unimpeded I mean I'm Sorry I looked when they were going across the border there and Guatemala and Mexico it didn't look like they were they were impeded at all\nThat it it didn't look at I mean they just busted the gate there was just not\nIt didn't look it didn't look any it didn't look that\nThey it just looked like they walk or ride on through ... and that was pretty much it\nSo that's that's the that's problematic\nAnd if these individual ... aren't if they don't want to wait for\nIn Mexico for any because see that's the thing they didn't they didn't have to come to the United states they could have stopped and in Mexico and they could have filed for amnesty et cetera but that's not what they want to do\nThey want to go beyond that\nThey're wanting to go all the way up to the border\nSays if they cover about Fifteen to twenty miles per day could take anywhere from sixty to eighty days well that would be after mid term\nThe border there and Guatemala and Mexico it didn't look like they were they were impeded at all\nThat it it didn't look at I mean they just busted the gate there was just not\nIt didn't look it didn't look any it didn't look that\nThey just look like they walk right on through ... and that was pretty much it\nSo that's that's the that's problematic\nAnd if these individuals' aren't aren't if they don't want to wait for\nIn Mexico for any because see that's the thing they didn't they didn't have to come to the United states they could have stopped and in Mexico and they could have filed for amnesty et cetera but that's not what they want to do\nThey want to go beyond that\nThey're wanting to go all the way up to the border\nKane says if they cover about Fifteen to twenty miles per day could take anywhere from sixty to eighty days well that would be after mid term\nWho knows what's gonna happen\nWho knows what's going to happen at this point\nAn edge to march up to the border and demand entry that's not going to work and if it if it ends up being five to seven thousand\nAre they going to try to break through like what we saw\nBecause I've heard some people say that looks like an invasion and you know what their rights\nAgain you could have stopped and sought amnesty in Mexico\nBut they didn't want to wait for that they just wanted immediately go in\nAnd then they didn't want to stay there there's going to go to the United states is it about him is do\nYou have to ask that question legitimately is it really about intimacy because you don't have to go all the way to the United states\nAnd apparently some in the caravan included the number of deportees deportees who have some experience with all of it\nBecause apparently now there's a second caravan that's formed in Honduras\nAnd they've already crossing the Guatemalan they're going to catch up to the main group that is now in Mexico\nTraveling with them as a man named Anthony ... says they twenty nine year old who was deported six times his last time just five months ago\nAnd so he's with marching and he's apparently advising people\nHow do you mean that's the thing what they're what people are going to want to do is they're going to want to have a stand off at the border\nAnd I think that they would\nTime it to be I I don't know after a while it's going to happen after midterms by the time they end up getting there\nI Do think that there are Democrats at once the optics of\nHaving that stand off at the border because can you go overboard can you overplay their hand\nThere's going to they're going to be some people who are going to I mean if you put a military response on the border to prevent the sort of storming of the gates is what we saw from Guatemala and Mexico you're going to have that optic and I'm gonna tell you what you're going to have Democrats are going to be campaigning on that forever but that doesn't mean Republicans should shy away from doing the right thing and protecting America sovereignty\nYou don't have the right to demand entry into someone else's home no nor do you have the right to demand in trenches someone an end to another country you just simply do not no matter what there is a legal process and you disrespect the country you disrespect the people in it by ignoring the legal process to enter the that particular sovereign entity\nAnd that's all there is to it it is a massive sign of disrespect it is a sign that says you cannot be trusted it is a sign that shows that you do not want to be in good faith enter the country and be a part of this you know the citizenry family that's what it showcases\nAnd sovereign entity doesn't have to let every person it\nThey don't have to let anyone it it's a sovereign entity\nThe rules of the sovereign entity are not dictated by forces or people outside\nI mean Republicans should shy away from doing the right thing and protecting America sovereignty\nYou don't have the right to demand entry into someone else's home no nor do you have the right to demand in trenches someone an end to another country you just simply do not no matter what there is a legal process and you disrespect the country you disrespect the people in it by ignoring the legal process to enter the that particular sovereign entity\nAnd that's all there is to it it is a massive sign of disrespect it is a sign that says you cannot be trusted it is a sign that shows that you do not want to be in good faith into the country and be a part of that you know the citizenry family that's what it showcases\nAnd its sovereign entity doesn't have to let every person it\nThey don't have to let anyone in its sovereign entity\nThe rules of the sovereign entity are not dictated by forces or people outside\nAnd this is this is it this is being used as political capitals what it is\nAnd I don't see any Democrats trying to just wait any of these individuals from undertaking it's very dangerous twelve hundred plus mile journey to the southern border going through cartel country\nWhere people go missing constantly and no one ever stops to search for them because it's just too dangerous where cops or even killed there was one story about a border town well it was close to a border town that was in cartel country where the sheriff was murdered and a female took over because she was done with the crime and she became share of all they killed her to\nAnd this is all for what Democrats want the optic they want the optic of a Republican president and then they're going to make they're going to make comparisons to\nCivil rights when a who was at a Bull Connor they're going to make comparisons to bulk up they're going to do all of that stuff\nI guarantee you that is what they're going to do that's what the plan is\nYou're going to have him go down there for a photo ops all of that stuff it is going to be a huge thing\nAnd they're going to try to make those individuals who think that everyone should enter legally because of the country has the right to know who is entering to make sure that you don't have bad characters and drain they're going to make those individuals look awful\nStarted that's what the goal is going to be in the media is going to work overtime to help them and how that did this depends on what happened during midterms\nIt all depends on what happens with midterms\nSo coming out there's more NFL anthem drama there

that\nWas invented by the white man sure which one we're not going to believe in it any more I\nDon't know I'm just like on a social justice warriors and who knows I literally have a story about how

um generous see it's so easy\n[noise]\nYeah you okay All right over there\nAnd it's just so ridiculous I mean it's literally the definition it's more about the feelings are are superseding facts like that so far the leftist grabs on to feelings instead of fat and this is the problem\nHere's the thing and then I Know we've got we've got some bills to say but you don't want to have you don't want science to follow politics and you don't want\nPeople to there has to be there has to be a legal standard\nNow you can do everything around that long as you're not foreseen individuals against their

weeks now uh because I was in the hospital for a period of time and it's an interesting story because all of my life or not all my life in later years when I was more competitive athlete and I'm\nReally was retired at a very early age I didn't have a lot to do uh I picked up the habit of drinking alcohol\nAnd I'll I'll never affected me quite the way does everybody else I was able to drink get drunk get up the next day and go to work and do whatever I Need to do or get up and and survive I never had hangovers I'd never really had any problem but I just came to the conclusion that\nAll right this is stifling me in some way shape or form\nAnd always talk to people about why do you smoke why do this why are you that while you that whatever and I just wondered what would be on the other side about drinking so I decided to stop drinking lo and behold when I stopped drinking what happened was you know your body is used to getting all that sugar each side as you said I have a glass of wine\nOr your drink whatever it is you sit back relax and your body goes off thank you I needed that\nRelax or so when I stopped drinking I and I just stopped cold turkey and people said do you know you should do something about drinking maybe goes somewhere look let me tell you something I don't know what's right for you what wrong for you or whatever but\nWhen people told me I should stop drinking I said I Am not going to go to a real quick because that's sick people and they're sick people teaching people to be sick\nThey're telling you that you are sick\nConclusion that All

drinking I said I Am not going to go to a rehab clean because that's sick\nPeople and they're sick people teaching sick people they'd be sick they're telling you that you are sick they're telling you that you have a problem that you can't overcome that problem and that your goal for the rest of your life is to get up every day and not drink\nThat is not my goal I stopped drinking multiple times in my life where I just because people say you drink too much what is it OK outside of ... and I just stop\nAnd I've stopped now for three weeks and I didn't have any kind of a reaction to it whatsoever

successful in my brain goes a thousand miles an hour goes twenty four seven\nI Can't sleep in fact when I stopped drinking I went three days in a row\nWhere I slept one hour at night\nThat was the one side of that 'cause I couldn't sleep because there was nothing there is no downers in my system to take me down and it never bothered me the next day was up I didn't feel like I didn't sleep it's a weird we're deal now what am I told you all this because when I went to them just as a couple of things like to hear it out over the last two weeks\nAnd one of them is is that too many of us believe that were helpless\nAnd that we we're cripples that we needed crutch and that just isn't true\nYou know I'm sure there's somebody out there is going to sit still you're crazy you have had these rehab clinics you have to have these twelve step programs guys I was doing it three to five bottles of wine and night I stopped cold turkey\nThat was at\nThe bottom line is people drank not because they need the alcohol\nYes eventually your body starts to crave the outcome I used to get the five o'clock cravings is like my fiancee would always laughing because it's five o'clock\nHalf which meant yep I find if I get to five o'clock and I could get a drink and boom Saul okay everything's fine but the ... it was all they ever got ... I I Know people to get up in the morning and start drinking vodka them they get out of bed\nRight this is a different kind of alcoholism\nBut it still comes down to the weakness of the mind because I look at like my daughter had alcoholism for a while she went and got treatment or got help now she's a competitive bodybuilder she's on a national stage she's and ripped to shreds the shape of her life there's no\nThere's no you are an alcoholic you are a loser you are this you or that and yet we let people believe that about themselves what I'm trying to tell you is\nThe problem you really have is you really have nothing in like the reason I started drinking 'cause I had already made all my money I had already won all my body building contest and already done everything that I wanted to do my bucket list in life had been checked off and there was nothing left me to do get up\nGot each I I Know people to get up in the morning and started breeding vodka them they get out of bed\nRight this is a different kind of alcoholism\nBut it still comes down to the weakness of the mind because I look at like my daughter had alcoholism for a while she went and got treatment or got help now she's a competitive bodybuilder she's on a national stage she's and ripped to shreds the shape of her life there's no\nThere's no you are an alcoholic you are a loser you are this you or that and yet we let people believe that about themselves what I'm trying to tell you is\nThe problem you really have is you really have nothing in like the reason I started drinking 'cause they've already made all my money I'd already won all my body building contest and already done everything that I wanted to do my bucket list in life had been checked off\nAnd there was nothing left me to do get up in a day do my radio shows and get back to society go to a few events where I Would help and talk to people in teaching motivate whatever it was it the rest of my life is really nothing for it I I work in my garden and I've got you know giant yard I spend most of my time working on but the point is is that\nI decided to stop\nAnd just see what happens how many of you can just stop doing this stupid stuff you're doing like paying off your mortgage like putting money in a four O. one K. U. R. blindly addicted to the stupid financial stuff that you're doing as well as most people who are addicted to alcohol and drugs you can't stop yourself\nWe had a seminar out in uh Las Vegas and I got an email back when people are like oh my God you can't expect us to stop contributing four one K. you can't expect just take our money out of our four one K. you can't expect us to not have our home paid in full I don't know do you are drunk on a date Ramsey\nYou're out of your mind drug up on somebody else's belief systems because those belief systems do not work and will not work towards becoming financially free and especially rich wealthy\nAbove and beyond the average person and so as like dropped off in this alcohol which is interesting was is that I started eating something at night that I've never eaten before I started getting like fruit nuts and stuff stuff that we normally think is healthy\nBut what I realized as all that stuff this is a kind of stuff that irritates something called dire ridiculous or something like that ... stomach disease and the test and disease or there's Powell ups and stuff and all that stuff got hit by somebody and all of a sudden I had diverted ... a um [noise]\nEvent you know it hurt and it hurt really bad so I went to the hospital the emergency room and they took X rays and said yeah you've got to hold your test\nAnd so now I'm sitting here in the hospital for six days ... massive medication like living on water liquid diet jello that kind of stuff [laughter]\nI'm just sitting there going like you know number one I'm so happy they don't have to worry about my business as my money my finances or whatever that I had the time and the energy to be able to take care of stuff like this\nBut once it was gone once I got out of it they sent me home I got a tube and my stomach I'll be getting it out soon but it's a drain to train all of the infected materials out of my body and all kinds of antibiotics\nBut I feel great don't get me wrong I mean I\nCould run a mile right now I'm back to the doctor said I've been over achiever said you're you'd be feel better if you get up and walk a little bit so did I Do I Do like twenty five laps around the whole wing\nOf the hospital I mean there's the athlete in the right you can see me running or walking with holding my you know the thing that the stuff into your arm you know I'm rolling it and I'm walking around like try to do it fast like trying to get some exercise and right and\nAnd my finances or whatever that I had the time and energy to be able to take care of stuff like this but what it was gone once I got out of it they sent me home I got a tube and my stomach I'll be getting it out too but it's a drain to train all the inspected materials out of my body model that about\nBut I feel great don't get me wrong I mean I could run a mile right now back to the doctor said I've been over the bridge that you're you'd be feel better if you get up and walk a little bit so what did I Do I Do like twenty five laps around the whole wing\nOf the hospital I mean there's the athlete in Iraq you can see me running or walking with holding my you know the thing is the stuff into your arm you know I'm rolling it and I'm walking around like try to do it fast like try to get some exercise that right\nThen I decided to get rid of the hundred houses start buying apartment complexes and I bought small apartment complex\nI remember having attenuated apartment complex was making me two thousand dollars a month I was making two hundred dollars a month and each unit will see two hundred a month types and those two thousand dollars a month twenty four thousand a year tax free\nIt was phenomenal I did almost nothing to run the stand your it was simple\nAnd I was making additional two thousand dollars a month ... then I went out and bought myself a from the twenty I went and bought a thirty unit the thirty unit was making me tremendous amount of money three thousand four thousand bucks a month something like that or an hour was making more money\nYou know tax free that I was making you know ever at my job by double\nThen I went on about a forty unit and make some money and then I went and bought a sixty sixty four unit which really the that was the criminal the crown that was the turning point for everything the sixty four unit was making me about ten thousand dollars a month by itself forget about all the other stuff\nThis one property I put a hundred and fifty thousand dollars down to buy that today you'd probably have to put\nProbably five hundred thousand dollars down to buy that property [noise] um but I bought it and after I bought that one I bought the one across the street and I bought the one next to it and then I bought two of them around the corner so here I was\nMaking like fifty thousand dollars a month with five apartment complex was phenomenal\nIt was phenomenal just money was just rolling and it was tax free money right there it was boom boom boom boom boom just rocket\nAnd at that point that says you know I pretty much quit in my brain I'm making more money than I ever ever ever dreamed of making when I was a kid I thought about making a hundred grand a year my dad never made a hundred grand a year that was going to be the ... and here I was making fifty grand about tax free\nAnd I really I didn't know where to go from there I read books I tried to hang out with people like try to get ideas but really I was so far ahead of everybody I knew that I had nobody to really lead me to the next level to where I should go\nRight and then at life\nThousand dollars a month with five apartment complex was phenomenal it was phenomenal just money was just rolling and it was tax free\nMoney right there it was a boom boom boom boom boom just rocket\nAnd at that point that says you know I pretty much quit in my brain I'm making more money than I ever ever ever dreamed of making when I was a kid I thought about making a hundred grand a year my dad never made a hundred grand a year that was going to be the criminal to cram and here I was making fifty grand about tax free\nAnd I really I didn't know where to go from there I read books I tried to hang out with people like try to get ideas but really I was so far ahead of everybody I knew that I had nobody to really lead me to the next level to where I should go\nRight and then\nAt lifestyles mentoring all these people some people came in that were way more aggressive I lost my edge\nI had decided that it was over the season of my life was my growth was over that's the seasons and I was living it [noise]\nI had more real estate anybody else in the group ah had prestige people knew me I was doing seminars um I was on the radio and everything seemed like okay you've arrived\nWithin some guys came in and started buying way more real estate than I did one guy came in about two hundred and forty units are in one apartment then a couple of months later bought four hundred eighty units and all of a sudden the guy was\nHad more units and I did\nAnd then he bought a portfolio and just went on and on people's just start following these guys and buy more and more and more and more real estate\nAnd I'm thinking wow this is incredible but wait\nI'm totally happy I shouldn't worry about the fact that these guys are making more money and buy more properties than I Am ... why should I even care and and rationally myself I don't care I'm not greedy I don't care what these guys do I like helping people make more money than me but one day somewhere along the line the season of my life changed\nAnd I said you know the only reason why I don't want to go out there and do all this is because I just don't want to do it all I'm at that point in my life where I've locked down it's simple\nSo what I did was I went out and found a guy and you guys know ms John Johnny Lama rich way and I taught him out of working in corporate America he was vice president second largest management company of the country I said look why did you come to lifestyles\nAnd I will set you up a portfolio properties all by them you manage them will be partners in the deal\nAnd then you'll be able to give up your job because you need income I Will produce a job for you income for you and he agreed to do it took me about two years to get him into the place but then we went out we bought for apartment complexes in a row\nAnd daresay were destroyed with these apartment complexes my whole image of how much money can be made completely changed I made more money in four years\nThat I had made in forty years previous to that because now I was doing this not only from my own self satiation\nBut for John in all of our partners in everybody else's involved and I thought man I got to go out there and do something we gotta do something big and we got out there and the excitement most actual here I Am I'm In a new season of my life\nI'm now a syndicator I'm now playing big I'm trying to keep up with the big boys I'm running the big giant deals and we bought a hundred and forty two hundred and fifty six hundred two hundred Seventy three hundred twenty unit so we just kept growing and growing\nAnd growing and growing now during that time we made\nMy whole image of how much money can be made completely changed I made more money for years that I had made in forty years previous to that because now I was doing this not only from my own self satiation\nBut for John ... all of our partners in everybody else's involved and I thought man I got to go out there do something we gotta do something big we got out there and the excitement moved back here I Am I'm In a new season of my life\nI'm now a syndicator I'm now playing big I'm trying to keep up with the big boys I'm running the big giant deals\nAnd we bought a hundred and forty year to two hundred and fifty six hundred two hundred Seventy ... three hundred twenty so we just kept growing and growing\nAnd growing and growing now during that time we made some aspect of it today\nI right now by about four properties this year so far about up trying to buy my fifth one right now and I was looking in my personal financial state but and I just looked at this and it just blew my mind\nAbout how credible\nThe money made on these properties where and when we come back from the break 'cause I don't want to short\nA short this thing I Want to go to go into a show you we made so much money\nIn a ... year period of time or whatever it was I don't know what it was two thousand two thousand uh let's see we got a sixteen about eight years made so much money that you're just blow your mind and that was an additional season of my life\nAnd it wasn't until that season was over

financial world works is\nIt gives you the ability to build an income to build wealth for yourself or your family your church synagogue jump or whatever it may be\nBut you can do that without having to get caught up in all of the the viciousness that has become the system but I Do want to talk a little bit of politics today simply because\nIt it how it's going to I think potentially affect the market and could potentially affect the market in a very great way I'm going to take a step back\nTo ... I remember it was an August and I'm thinking it was two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on and talking about how people were losing trust in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications\nAnd what you found back then was there were only two groups in and this was before ... and by the way some remember that part of it or whatever that you know few months before that so they rate\nI look at the sheer vitriol and hatred on both sides\nIn what's been happening with Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Ford and all the rest of it and I don't care which is fine to that argument Iran first of all if you believe firmly believe one side or the other ... you have to realize we don't really have a lot of facts okay\nAnd you can say well then that means ... that means y understand all that\nBut real lined the total lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and they will have consequences for the market and as I mentioned I have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong but if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years\n... and Dr Ford and all the rest of it and I don't care which side to that argument Iran first of all if you both firmly believe one side or the other ... you have to realize we don't really have a lot of facts okay and you can say well then that means ... that means y understand all that\nBut real lined the total lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and it will have consequences for the market and as I mentioned I have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong\nBut if that were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives are going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just 'cause I got cut off a little bit in the first segment therefore the classroom and to be teaching is before the crash\nAnd the idea this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach\nBut the idea of this is before the market goes down you gotta know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up but\nThe average retail trade or will never make money and the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I've given us a lot of thought to about you know people keep coming in and told me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors well defined investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders real life that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue with gamble\nThey put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong and again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is is that when the market turns down can turn down very quickly\nIf you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of games think about this from it Thirteen Years of games in a year and a half okay\nIf you want Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now\nHow is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down then you can on the move up so again in classroom and talk about all these ideas we're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people focus on what's called technical analysis they're using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked winter like four okay you know you have your ... to camp to extend your are your uh see the eyes and you know there's a vote for thousands or hundreds of these things right\nSo how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got they won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weather\nWe're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people will focus on what's called technical analysis they're using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators\nIf this really worked winter like four okay you know you have your ... to camp sticks in your are your ah see the eyes and ears on hold for thousands or hundreds of these things right so how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got a I won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecasters really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now\nAnd the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes [laughter] okay [laughter]\nAnd that's a lot of this is that people accused something because it's the best they think they've got but\nIt's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things are really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market it's supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make this a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but we always make sure that when we wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing\nAs opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do so again if you want to come out to a class I'm going to be teaching this

on confidence it also means that his ability to continue to cut taxes and regulation again you may think those are bad things\nBut those things have helped the market we have to realize that all of that is at risk of changing pretty quickly\nSo that the classroom it'd be teaching and by the way it totally aside from that there's some other things out there right now that indicate that the market may well be near the top\nWe're getting into to those ideas and just a couple of minutes but the to me the key is you have to know what to do before things go bad if you wait till they go bad is it happens way too fast and you can't react in time\nYou've got to be position before it happens now when the markets falls I mentioned the market when it fell in two thousand eight two thousand nine the market and the S. and P. gave back Thirteen Years of profits in a year and a half\nThat's how fast these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to two thousand level\nThat was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years and people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon most people's investment horizon it's thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years and you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside\nThat's very very hard for people to achieve their goals\nSo we're going to be talking about how do we identify the prices which big institutions like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at you know when he was buying apple a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five\nThat would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and I will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think\nFat these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to two thousand level\nAnd that was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years and people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon most people's investment horizon it's thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years and you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside\nThat's very very hard for people to achieve their goals\nSo we're going to be talking about how do we identify the prices would you begin institutions like Goldman Sachs for people like Warren Buffett are buying at you know when he was buying apple it a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five\nThat would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and that will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was fine apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics of how do I want to actually make money when the stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is that they invest in stocks because they think they're safe stocks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into because\nTheir markets only open six and a half hours a day Seventeen and a half hours of every day and forty eight hours of every weekend you cannot protect yourself yes you can use options to limit your losses but you're still going to have laws okay\nIf you had homeowner's insurance and it only covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected I think most people would not okay\nAnd my dad's the situation people in in the market so again to me this is an incredibly important class and I will I've ... I've taught this class before it's always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those will be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThat the world has changed in my opinion from a marketing a RINO manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you could always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at it charged with looking it indicators which are the wrong thing\nThere's a fundamental we'd better approach again that I was teaching class so if you want to come out you can get to free tickets free tablet plus we'll feed you launch be one of the next dozen\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that T.

new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hardest time of the day between three and ... and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest some of the day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\nThere's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it\nSo the smart energy management the way to the analogy of the people like like that I've been told is remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance\nMonday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay it a better rate\nWith our telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would beat they were making money hand over fist met her when we called made long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when the hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars and forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars um it it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill all walk on that if you are right plan it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... ... it's criminal um I see that the power companies thank you [laughter] I say the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I ...\nA hundred and eighty nine dollars um it it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... ... it's

Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you any more\nSo you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's gonna continue to go off\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them and I explain all this to them\nSo not only are you paying between seven and a half and eat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying towards the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people there is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus the electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um\nIt it just it doesn't make sense for them they can you raise everybody should just call you just find out how to read\nTheir bill and then I don't know how to read they're real and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even

see me or even while they're working with me\nAnd I want to clarify something also um\nBecause we do a lot of networking we go to a referral group to go to leave for his regarding networking group to go to social networking a band and\nI think there's a difference but we want to\nPut in place or or make people understand the difference between just giving somebody a referral for networking and actually having a JV partnership with them because one way or another there is compensation in there it's not just hey I'm a networking king or queen I'm going to just keep referring you there's compensation is a two way street\nSo keep that in mind also when you're thinking about this\nAnd and now that's not to say that\nIf you know a great attorney and you're you don't have a a formal arrangement with them you're not going to refer of course you're going to refer or maybe this is something you do often you do talk to that attorney and say I don't mind it not be the best one I don't think they are allowed to but uh an accountant let's say\nYou refer to an account ... you might want to talk to and say hey I refer a lot of people you can we do something to formalized best because I'd love to compensate you for sending referrals my way\nAnd you were compensate for referring people for referring people your way so again that's when when when we're talking about\nIn state right into the compensation which doesn't always have to be monetary remember that people compensation\nSo keep in mind also when you're thinking about this\nAnd and now that's not to say that\nIf you know a great attorney and you're you don't have a a formal arrangement with them you're not going to refer of course you're going to refer or maybe if this is something you often you do talk to that attorney and say that mind it but not be the best one I don't think they are allowed to but uh an accountant let's say\nYou refer to an account ... you might want to talk to and say hey I refer a lot of people you can we do something to form a wise because I'd love to compensate you for joining referrals my way\nAnd you will compensate for referring people for me referring people your way so again that's when when when we're talking about\nIt's the right it's the compensation which doesn't always have to be monetary remember that people compensation not always have to be monitored it may be referrals it may be saying hey you know what I refer a lot of business you and I know your clients really don't\nNeed my products or services or they're not my ideal client however you know how I work
