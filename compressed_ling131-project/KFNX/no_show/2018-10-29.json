power bill has gone up significantly dramatically and it's going to continue to go up significantly and dramatically and if I can help her pay this bill now\nAnd she can't have this bill we need to find a solution and I knew nothing about solar I didn't know how it worked I didn't know how much it cost and I wrote my sleeves up and I looked into it and it made sense produce sure on power and pay less for it\nAnd if somebody's trying to sell your battery talk to me before you do because people don't understand better either not rate what they can do what you want them to do but the electric

see about us and similarly the Bible sets forth an impressive a ray of events which were to take place in the earth following the return of the divine Christ\nIf we can see the beginning of some of these events it is logical to conclude that the parents here or presents a price but even now be a reality\nKind of Bible student now see any of these signs or events taking place and Jessie can\nAs a matter of fact there are a number of prophecies of his return which is the most spectacular to me certainly nothing similar to these prophecies describe what has yet taken place around us\nDon't be too sure us so much pictorial language is used in the prophecies of Christ returning second presence\nThat is true of the prophetic shout and trumpet blowing these expressions are pictorial of things which would occur during the early years of his presence there shout is one of encourage incitement which already has stirred up the downtrodden people and nations of earth started them on the march looking for freedom\nBy Jesus said that his presence would be as a lightning which would reach from east to west and to come to think of at that may describe the bright shining of the sun reaching from east to West is that what Jesus meant\nYes it is his presence will I should a new day for mankind\nIt will be like the sun in the sense that the enlightening influences of Christ through the agencies have his kingdom will be worldwide from east to west but not until the work of his kingdom is complete at the end of the thousand years\nWill the world be fully in life so Jesus explained

reach from east to west and to come to think of that that may describe the bright shining of the sun reaching from east to West is that what Jesus meant\nYes it is his presence will I wrote a new day for mankind\nIt will be like the sun in the sense that the enlightening influences of Christ through the agencies have his kingdom will be worldwide from east to west but not until the work of his kingdom is complete at the end of the thousand years\nWell the world be fully in life so Jesus explained that the people will know of his second presence but it will all but the result in the late ... and blessing of the whole world\nAbout and that you haven't said much so far about how Christ is president has a fee for the night I'd like you to pick that thought\nWell Jesus himself said that he would come as a fee\nBut his watching disciples has earned the very early signs of his presence and therefore the first wants to know about it the prophecies reveal that there would be a considerable periods in the beginning of his parents see our presence but only his faithful followers would know about it\nThat the world in general would not know Paul said something of the day of Christ presidents that one day she'll say peace and safety then sudden destruction come up on them as Dr veil up on a woman with child and they they should not escape\nThat suggests I presume spasms of destructive tropical such as the world has experienced relate during my generation I think that we could say that\nThe trouble from the first World War on has come as Dr veil upon a woman with child\nIndeed Russell if you notice it carefully we'll see that it has been in in increments towards bathrooms or periods of trouble and that's why I said a few moments ago that only as we see the events of our day as signs of Christ second presidents can we understand the true significance\nAnd remember this soon and Russell very soon\nThe distraught in Fairfield people of earth will be

then renting\nAbsolutely ... so you know um\n[noise] these are your rents there is a I saw it and I think it's called rent monkey just today that the average rent America ... county is going up ten percent a year\nSo every time he leaves me news so at ten percent of an average rent is a hundred and fifty dollars so your rent is going up a hundred and fifty dollars every month every time you Reno your yearly so after five years you know you're at a seven hundred and fifty dollars more than you paid when you started your lease\nAnd when you purchase a home your mortgage is going to go up a little bit 'cause your taxes are going to just every year but it's going to go up ten or Fifteen or twenty dollars or you know a month maybe as compared to a hundred and fifty dollars a month with your rent you know you're just you're paying somebody else's mortgage for them you're paying somebody else's investment for them you need to pay for yourself\nRight and it seems to me that people really should take a look at what that situation is calling because so many people out there I Know many people would just say oh I can never get buy a house because I'm sure I don't have the credit but you're here they can they can turn it around let's talk about that program again so they can hear it\nSo there's there's a couple of different programs but the benefits are are include a having credit as low as six twenty to purchase a home a lot of people think it has to be you know higher than six sixty or six Seventy or you know seven hundred or whatever\nSix twenty which is pretty low credits to be able to buy a home there's programs with no mortgage insurance I we didn't talk about mortgage insurance but this is a little\nFee that you have to pay in your monthly mortgage payment unless you put twenty percent down\nThese programs have no mortgage insurance with no downpayment wow yeah go ahead so uh you know and we were talking about the benefits of um uh owning versus renting and moving costs so um when you move into a ... little rental what you are\n[laughter] you have um you know your first month's rent you have your security deposit you have a clean deposit if you have pets you have large deposits you know that could be as much as three or four thousand dollars may not back either you know you're not right so and and I can get you into these programs for less than a

beings on this planet that we have more rights than we are\nLed to believe and most of us are afraid to get in trouble we're afraid for for something to happen or bad to happen to us and so we stay

ourselves in the hour we're going to heal our nation and our world\nUm things are really great happy to be here today I'm just outside of\nCalgary, Canada in oak talks little community called oak

the lower\nLower frequency there's a lot of despair and physical pain in it there's a lot of people who are depressed I'm lots of illness sadness financial desperation\nAnd then you know you move up a bit and you have people that have moments of happiness and periods of joy but they're always expecting something terrible to happen and so a lot of conditioning and those two lower levels you know a lot of belief systems that are holding them back from moving forward\nAnd then I was looking around and I saw these people are just like really happy and their relationships for healthy and um they

kicking off your shoes and walking barefoot on dirt and grass no we often hear about are things mental health benefits since being nature is a proven way to boost your mood and lower stress\nBut I Know that the you know why he said earth thing cannot to improve our looks and slow aging\nThe idea behind er thing is that if you take your socks and your shoes off and you walk actually in the dirt you can absorb electrons from the earth now why this is important is because\nThe idea of oxidation and so our bodies all day are are bombarded with free radicals free radicals are damaged molecules that are trying to steal an electron from your healthy molecules and you're healthy cells\nAnd the reason why we recommend let's say putting vitamin C. on your skin and eating colorful fruits and vegetables is because you are then adjusting anti accidents\nOr anti opposite donate electrons to neutralize free radicals and that's why these types of foods and these ... are great for your skin they're great for your uh anti aging\nSo the idea that behind her thing that you can absorb electrons from the earth\nIs that you are now then absorbing these electrons and those electrons can act to once again neutralize free radicals so similar to putting vitamin C. serum on your skin or eating colorful fruits and vegetables or drinking red wine you can get a similar effect by absorbing those electrons from the earth and doing it that way\nYou were held these are top priority intelligence for your house [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is intelligence for your health radio\nYou are

we've been spending a lot of time talking about the bomber and that sort of thing and I wanted to grab you on a couple of those things at the end of this interview but would you mind talking about the fact that we see continued that bridge to try to ban plastic here and banned plastic there\nAnd the fact is I thought plastics has actually been one of the things we had done that actually made our lives we take it for granted but it's made our lives a whole lot safer from a lot of the threads that human beings have faced literally for thousands of years and plastic as the way we've escape from some of those threats\nOh absolutely and in fact uh as I wrote this article about it go fundamentalists attacks on plastics\nOr I thought back to the Nineteen sixty seven film the graduate uh and you

I thought back to the Nineteen sixty seven film the graduate or and you may remember that uh Dustin Hoffman plays the title role and he said his graduation party and the guy comes up to him and says uh then I have one word\nFor you time or it as a and a half century since then plastics have really revolutionized are so many industries uh\nAnd uh you know when I was training and and medicine we had just converted from glass bottles for intravenous solutions and blood to plastic bottles and it was such a remarkable improvement they store better they keep better\nThey're safer because inevitably glass bottles which would be dropped a and the ... the glass on the floor and you would you would never get up\nAnd people would get caught and and\nSo on a but medical\nDevices or electronics all sorts of things\nUh plastics had been really a revolution and yet the activists continue to attack it a Earth Day in April of this year was a devoted to ending plastic pollution quote unquote and um\nWe continue to have a attacks on various plastic ... things that make plastics pliable and and more convenient or like this ... a BPA\nUm and the attacks just go on and on and on a a base with without much basis um and uh without\nThinking about it carefully and considering the science\nWell and I thought about that too because I Know a lot of people say well you know there's food safety\nBut I buy my food in tin cans when a lot of people may not appreciate is those so called tin cans with ... which have very little ten in them are actually lined with as you said BPA and other kinds of things that make\nA tin can a whole lot more safe for containing any kind of food you buy the grocery store and and and and the plastics\nYou know dog I think about the plastics where products you know including a lot of food products are package sometimes hermetically sealed and you know the air and taken out or some other kind of gas put in so that so that everything last longer and worries or is better and better protected\nAgainst the kind of common contamination they could literally take your life or a few decades ago\nYou're you're absolutely right and you you bring up a of\nA broader point which is that you have to you have to do with the risk analysis folks called comparative risk assessment\nYou have to ask if you if you will lemonade a product day what are you a substitute for what are you left with a and so we're seeing that in California because there's a a a\nState senator who keeps introducing bills to ban Styrofoam containers from restaurants\nFor

and because it both inflated and kept the juice where I Belong and they said well you have to get rid of these because they don't degrading the landfill and when I went on research in a long time ago I had people say well we're going to replace them with plastic coated paper oh how does that'd be great and they said well it doesn't quite last\nDan Styrofoam containers from restaurants\nFor takeout

thing is that a ... a generates less waste water and also occupies less space in the landfill\nAnd the other thing is that we have we now have\nBacteria that will degrade\nA Styrofoam and and other plastics in the landfill so you know ... is that these objections these attempts to band things or just not well founded and well thought out so which is typical of what we say about the anti corporate anti technology a pickle fundamentalist\nPay I Want to ask you about something else because about about an hour ago I was talking to a guest a who's a former police detective we were talking about the bomber you know the bombs that went through the males and he said well what he ... he thought it was interesting that we found out he's a he was a ... a retired top investigator for New York city's police department and he said we found out the postal service\nHas things like this going through it and we don't even know it and I thought and we're always hearing about other kinds of contraband whether it's illegal drugs from Asia\nOr we're seeing a stuff come through that's that's a marijuana get shipped that way and if states haven't decided to legalize it it shouldn't be ship\nAnd I asked him we had this technology we see at the airport and I you know while I don't know all the particulars of it I Know that when they watch your bag with computers and cell phones and this and batteries and all that goes through\nThey know what color the screen is supposed to be and they know what colors indicate it may be some kind of contraband whether it's a fluid that liquid or possibly explosive\nYou know I don't know what color explosive comes up as 'cause I Would imagine I haven't been through the TSA line when somebody whose putting explosives through but my understanding is the color coding helps them spot those things pull him aside and do some more examination I said if you wanted to scan hundreds of thousands of uh packages the postal service carried\nCould we do that and could we say to a computer\nWhen a certain kind of material or what appears to be that kind of material comes through you know as we X ray could we X ray you know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that may or may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicks set aside\nAnd and let somebody else take a closer look at it that's all the technology that did within our grasp isn't it\nIt it it is and with artificial intelligence or the system can actually learn what it needs to reject and ... and red flag and pass a law uh in fact it's my understanding that\nChecked baggage is a analyze that way as well as the the the baggage that you put put on a conveyor belt yourself\nSo we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like\nWhen a certain kind of material or what appears to be that kind of material comes through you know as we X ray could we X ray you know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that may or may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicks set aside\nAnd and let somebody else take a closer look at it that's all the technology to ditch within our grasp isn't it\nIt is and with artificial intelligence or this system can actually learn what it needs to reach in red slide pass all are in fact it's my understanding that\nChecked baggage is a analyze that way as well as the baggage that you put on a conveyor belt yourself\nSo we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like they're strangers doing the job they do now but they're losing first class mail but why don't we make sure that the stuff that's going through the post office gets scanned by that same kind of thing I think the public would be all for it\nYeah I think we could certainly do that for packages or you know flat flat letters or probably sail through may be doing chess for packages that's very good idea laws\nWell I just it just struck me that if that's within our grasp but I'm the same guy who wants to see a chicken irradiated before it gets into the supermarket so we can kill all the salmonella or the other bacteria or eco allied that's on the exterior of it is it isn't a cure all but it was her take a ... a lot of the contamination and probably\nPeople freak out and and and unfortunately with bears a you know that panic attack is often what will trigger the bears to act aggressively\nHere Joe I thought you were keeping most of the nuts in Virginia up and the purple part of the state around Richmond is don't you try to keep them confined up there\nWill you try to at least get them elected to office and then they can do crazy things like you know go back in the valley in on a board member from a jails to try to get you know our catcher in the middle east program

called terrorist threats\nI wanted to drill down on that for a long time people understand what that really involved\nTerrorist threats under the law means that you are threatening to commit an act of violence against an individual or physical property and it also can include threats designed to influence a branch of government\nOr politics so I'm going to be paying close attention to that and said

R.\nAll ...\nAnd this is out of the daily mail but again I'm not reporting back to the says I'm reporting on the daily mail Caesar\n\nAll tear say Iraq was taken into custody on friday morning in\nPlantation Florida in connection with the bombs the suspect is they mailed bombing spree targeting critics of president Donald Trump a male bombing spray\nIt was not a bomb\nI'm going to say that again we guys give me a wide shot here in Studio ... that is a bronze re creation of a famous statue of the battle but was it deliberately\n... and going from memory teleprompter three or ... lost the

soldier we understand from three thousand years ago I Know you know that\nBut I'm trying to explain the Democrats and CNN everybody else that we don't buy your hoax that these fake bombs were real bombs and I don't buy any of the rest of your story I mean you've got this guy they're calling a white male\n\nAnd showed that pitcher to a thousand people that I Would say he looks Hispanic or Native American which is fine I'm not trying to blame some group on race here I Am saying none of this adds up the van looks fake\nThe timing the fact that the media hypes it can be all this violence against Democrats and it's kind of it's coming into Trump's fault the Dow Jones fault it's a free press this fall\nThen fake bombs get mailed out\nHis van looks like something out of central casting\nAnd now this happens they're calling him a white male and I I guess you could identify as white\nAnd now we've got photos I've been coming out at blacks for Trump and other rallies\nI don't think we know

was\nA back rented a pleasure to have you with us\nA very good morning to you guys are yeah October has flown by and welcome back to you got to ah\nYou talked to find a river and what am I in my mind are focused on leaky got repair which we knew was a a real critical issue the physicians were screaming saying look we've got to take care of candy they're parasites and ... and you have to help us with\nTight junction are and the um the soft tissue\nThat makes up the digestive tract because this is the precursor to this is the first domino to fall\nIf we end up do you talk to find a live a wonderful but if you if the guy is still in a a terrible a quantum leap a somewhat the these are condition and this is just that uh we're never going to really have long term results are and so that was the reason that we added candy at a complex and Sarah packed tasted a lot for put about health and\nThen we ended up coming along with the leak got repair for individuals who are you know had the chronic is individuals who have also is um ... or ... you know those individuals severe cases\nLook we can get rid of the or at least I could try to control the candy to population and the parasites and so forth but if it leaves behind all damage a skin a tissue layer or in the digestive tract people are going out and there are vying for voucher thing no that's healthy and it is\nA and the one thing that I say when I'm In front of a a crowd of people that are interested in and sort of correcting a lot of health issues when it comes to the guy is look you have to rebuild that got lining otherwise provided accept no interest in staying\nIt's sort of you know your rent ending new applicants into an apartment building where all the the windows were broken out there's no appliances you have to rebuild thing [noise]\nYou know had the chronic is individuals who have also has um ... or ... you know those individuals severe cases\nLook we can get rid of the or at least I could try to

windows were broken out there's no appliances you have to rebuild saying\nHey I'm Brenda in a family member just got a diagnosis fatty liver\nAnd I'm I'm Wondering what can you take off with your pet 'em in and tell everyone uh the consequences of not taking care of that fatty liver and also how many people in our country or a on average have fatty liver and can you tell us more about how how pads on may help that situation\nYeah thank you it's great question a lot of scope questions here so to gain a little bit of perspective\nAbout one in three people or have ... or so it\nMay not be diagnosed but are in the category of fatty liver and if we look at the spectrum it goes from a fatty liver to massive fibrosis to sort of roses to you don't want to be in that category so uh\nYou want to soon as you get to the stage uh and it's when you get to the point where you're about five to eight percent concentration of fat cells within the liver you're in that ... river category\nAnd had you know uh whether or not you have fatty liver very tough Patel because we don't have nerve endings down there you're not going to get ... where you are going to get some digestive issues and you are going to have trouble regulating glucose cycle you're fasting blood glucose will be hire\nA than a if you had a healthy or liver\nUm there are some other science but those are typically the what the ones that stand out to a third of folks are in that category fifty percent of people over the age of ... um this is a big time trend so forty years ago this uh with about twenty five percent of the uh fatty liver population\nUm was a individuals who are who are getting it from not from alcohol but from other sources now it's completely flipped so we know it's coming from food\nYou can't really get around that if you go out to a restaurant you're probably not getting organic foods I write so\nThese are the issues that we're grappling with and when you take in things like GMOs you know they contain ... for the life of snake pits the digestive track then runs into the liver and then it sort of stops the grind the whole phase one conjugation a phase one\nOr some ... called subtraction face I mean that it also complicate face\nTo conjugation said and both of those are important when you're talking about the ... I\nI wanted to do the mission Brennan that a lot of people don't realize they eat the same foods day after day after day developed to chip in cheese and when this happens the membrane horrors and the gap membrane become a large and as that happens the conscience inside of our GI track\nA leak into our system the circulation\nThat's just off a whole cascade of events or which we call the ige easy for special immune cells that attacking attach themselves to the unwanted or a conscience of getting to the systemic circulation ring the bell Mike through to a lab right on them\nThe whole phase one conjugation a phase one\nA so called subtraction fade I find that it also complicate face\nTo conjugation ... and both of those are important when you're talking about the carpet I\nI wanted to do the mission Brennan that a lot of people don't realize they eat the same foods day after day after day developed to chip in cheese and when this happens the membrane horrors and the gap membrane become a large and as that happens the conscience inside of our GI track\nA leak into our systemic circulation\nThat's just off a whole cascade of events or which we call the ige easy for special immune cells that attacking attach themselves to the unwanted or a conscience of getting to the systemic circulation print them out\nOf my lab right on them because we can repair address this issue and it gets into a very very uh a human face that most people have no clue about how well this product work\nYeah and I'm a little surprised by my my breath rate in this industry too because I Know this is a major should be a major focus of of our industry and yet I I don't know if there's the formulation that sort of addresses all these issues that I think a critical for the healing process\nSo you know we have the zinc in there that's to a address are all sort of repair episode or regeneration college and synthesis very critical very helpful for folks who have a silly act writes a clue to me but for inflammation uh increased costs will secretion\nWe have the organic slippery alum and the marshmallow route\nThat is sort of a to create\nAlmost a synthetic if you can think of it that way although it is natural a protective mucosal secretion\nI in place or the cause of secretion that you yourself will secrete only when you have healthy for yourselves which when you have got\nIs not always the case um we have licorice route again to address ulcers Hartford inflammation we have ... that is also to quell auto immune issues and information it stabilizes the ...\nSo that they released a lot less histamine at the site of the ah got lining\nOr any jeep there are again it's a a episode we'll sell 'em regeneration ... college in ... synthesis but also helps to stimulate your own your costs will secretion so when you combine all of these things together\nI end up formulation you have a tissue regeneration increased me coastal secretion anti inflammatory tight junction were very protective coating that really that's the those that combination of those ingredients help people repair and regenerate and get away from\nAh the constant leaking or as you said into the circulatory system works stimulate your immune system a lot of folks come back to the uh and they say look uh I don't have digestive issues the heartburn has gone away the interesting thing is I can sleep better\nAnd yeah so I all of these things you know and and that may be a as a result it a lot of the neurotransmitters um that help us to sleep a they're created and the guy so when we talk about you know they got being the second brain or that Vegas nerve\nIs Ninety percent transmitting or information from the guts to the brain not the other way around ten percent of the brain to the guy oh if you're having yeah if you're having sleep is your\nUm this may also be something that you might want to focus on we got repair overall\nHave Brandon a compliance with our uh people that come in and buy these types of products what can you tell us about the proper way to really take at least you got for the best\nA lot of folks come back to the uh and they say look uh I don't have digestive issues the heartburn has gone away the and the interesting thing is I can sleep better\nAnd yeah so uh all of these things you know and and that may be a as a result it a lot of the neurotransmitters um that help us to sleep a they're created and the guy so when we talk about you know the guts being the second brain or that Vegas nerve\nIs Ninety percent transmitting a information from the get to the brain not the other way around ten percent from the brain to the got well if you're having yeah if you're having sleep issues\nUm this may also be something that you might want to focus on we got repair overall\nThey Brendan a compliance with our uh people that come in and buy these types of products what can you tell us about the proper way to really take at least you got for the best effect\nYeah a great question and I and I think I like to recommend that folks take this I'm On a a relatively empty stomach\nA and a typically when you know you're not going to be eating anything for a good period of time to a lot of folks that take leaving got repair they're taking it at night uh you know a good hour hour and a half after they've had their last meal or so the coating can\nAh really reside or on the digestive track for preventing and creating a barrier between all the things that the women at the just the track that typically stimulate the immune to a because when your immune system engages\nIt's shooting everywhere and you're going to get a lot of friendly fire so when you put it in their ah and it's got a lot of time to sit there and I'm a create a repair environment that's sort of ideal and we get individual who are highly reactive ... everything\nAnd those people sometimes take the product before they eat a and that probably has to do with again the anti inflammatory and to a certain extent the code and\nUh and that helps them digest saying uh without paying\nRent and how long should we take this product at least you got repair how long should we take it and should we take a break after Ninety Days or will we ever get rid of our ... she got\nYeah wow that's a and that really is a question that comes down and yeah that's it [laughter] that comes out to the individual what does your diet look like now what did your diet looked like before and what's the sense of the damage\nAnd how much or is your immune system engaged in creating a problem and to the to the extent that we were talking about before with can't data and parasites what other organizations are in there that are continuously aggravating that situation\nSo uh when somebody comes to what typically a and complains of of pain\nThey will start taking leaky got repair and they typically report back within a day or two the pain have gone away or at the very least received a dramatic like that's the good side um\nHow much you should take and how long we have individuals that take just one or two a day and they're perfectly fine after a month\nReceded dramatically that's a good side um\nHow much you've taken how long we have individuals that take just one or two a day and they're perfectly fine after a month\nAbsolutely so if you have been on an antibiotic like you said it's just so so important that you take probiotics especially during that time yeah because like you said you do kill off all that bacteria\nThat's really important to re hydrate replenish that got and so in this case I Would suggest for you the urgent care which is that a hundred billion again it's the solar a micro biome that we are talking about and specific that when you come in and you'll see the urgent care as that specific one that would be perfect\nAnd if you're wondering like well when do I take it just didn't actually on the box says two hours after the antibiotic to take the antibiotic you wait two hours minimum I Would say and then you can go ahead and take that probiotics can re cultivate and read you know recalling nights the got\nReal good real good now how long do I have to be on this\nOh well that's a question so if you're on antibiotics you know it's so hard to say because antibiotics you killed so much of your got to really I mean I Would always recommend a minimum of thirty days which is actually in this case it thirty ... per the bottle but easily you could I mean a ... is a central you know you could take this\nEvery day just like you would take your multi so it's really important but if you've been on the the antibiotic I Would definitely suggests at least the whole package of the urgent to really help sort of free strengthen the God\nWill that's real good now I notice too in one of your great formula here you have a weight formula can you tell me a little bit about that one\nAnd I think that this one come January to will be a\nReally really popular one because not only are you getting of course you're probiotics which are great for your digestive health your immune system but the way formula is actually designed to do a lot of different things and so when we think about weight issues a lot of the time we talk about blood sugar right help our blood sugars off were either hungry or not hungry and everything we're going to be thrown off so the cool thing about\nThis one is it does have strains that will actually help regulate your blood sugar will help curb and\nUh basically Kirby appetite but also help you know ... um [noise]\nBasically balance the appetite I should say in general so whether you're trying to lose weight I guess I'm trying to say or maybe gain weight having the balance of your appetite is really important for your way in general so there's a lot of cool things that it will help with the weight in specific okay cool and now that one I can take like a month after month after month correct absolutely\nJust I mean really most of these you could take all the time if you wanted to but of course like things we ... we have with the urgent right that's usually more specific for like an antibiotic or if you're really trying to boost your immune system so like the wintertime you value family coming in with all that's going on it's okay to take the urgent even if you didn't take an antibiotic because we're really help boost\nRight how far blood sugars off were either Hungary or not hungry and everything we're going to be thrown off so the cool thing about this one is it does have strains that will actually help regulate your blood sugar will help curb a physically hurt the apple type but also help you know ... um [noise]\nBasically balance the appetite I should say in general so whether you're trying to lose weight I guess I'm trying to say or maybe gain weight having the balance of your appetite is really important for your way in general so there's a lot of cool things that it will help with the weight in specific okay cool and now that one I can take like a month after month after month correct\nAbsolutely just I mean really most of these you could take all the time if you wanted to but of course like things we've had we've had with the urgent\nRight that's usually more specific for like an antibiotic or if you're really trying to the gym and since I'm so like the wintertime you value family coming and we put all this going on it's okay to take the urgent even if you didn't take an antibiotic because we're really help boost the immune system\nSince we know the eighty percent of our immune system is actually in our gut\nRight and it's all starts in the gut right\nTheory absolutely I tell you about your guts are transmits a signal to your brain so\nThey're not the other way around so much but hey for more information go solar ray dot com so L. A. R. A. Y. dot com also these products are right here at ... in our refrigerated case come in the store were six zero to nine or seventh street come in and ask for solar ray\nWe're going to be talking about more of these products here about the my question is a few years ago we only had one or two probiotics on the show we had maybe six billion or a billion\nNow we have a robotic formula for many different parts of your body a sex men women or you know even have a urgent care if you're taking antibiotics\nSo the key to what can you shed light on why all the manufacturers are jumping on the bandwagon to pick a certain part of your body to help can you tell us more\nYeah one of the things I Want to mention to a probiotic is we are ten times more bacteria than we are human cells\nSo if you think about that it's kind of creepy but we're walking bacteria right I Know it's gross and some hand sanitizer no actually just getting going on um but in this case since we are so much like your it's everywhere in our guts in our ears it's in our nose it is the main part of our body in the way that just as much as we need water we need bacteria\nAnd so without being said since that bacteria is everywhere we could have something that would be cool and specific right we could have something that would be your weight specific the urgent response because there's so many different strains in the body\nAnd there's so many different things are these different formulas that are going to help with different issue that people might be having in fact most of our issued some from our got anyway right if if I got off we're going to be off in one way shape\nOr form right 'cause it all starts in the guts really does so and now it's going to also ask you to a little bit more about the product um tell me about the interior coated\nHolding that you've got on there yeah absolutely so I'm sort of giving you a little idea of what ... means OK I'm genes anybody seeing it in order for a probiotic\nTo have the word and hear it on the front of the package and it has to last a minimum of sixty minutes within the body okay because I think from consumption to actually get to the small intestine it take sixty minutes to get there and so within its guaranteeing that this probiotic\nIt's going to get the small intestine and a fully intact all the way through so that's a little idea of the word in ... and in this case with a micro biome actually this particular collection we've made it in the chair shield\nFor the old technology would coated\nBut the new technology is the shield and the field is basically a pine fiber\nWith pine fat and those together are so strong that they can actually withstand the acidity but when they get to the small intestine the great part is they actually open up their rates so they're not seen talked all the way through and then they never opened the rate parties\nA little idea of what ... means OK I'm Keith anybody seeing it in order for a probiotic\nTo have the word and hear it on the front of the package and it has to last a minimum of sixty minutes within the body okay because I think from consumption to actually get to the small intestine it take sixty minutes to get there and so within its guaranteeing that this probiotic\nIt's going to get to the small intestine and a fully intact all the way through\nSo that's a little idea of the word and ... and in this case with a micro biome actually this particular collection we've made it in the chair shield\nFor the old technology which coated\nBut the new technology is the shield and the shield is basically a pine fiber\nWith pine fat and those together are so strong that they can actually withstand the acidity but when they get to the small intestine the great part is they actually open up their race or they're not seen talked all the way through and then they never opened\nThe rate parties when they get to the intestine the PH level will let those open and then they can call and I forgot oh good\nThat's awesome explanation now the other thing is we have a five dollar off coupon yet the coupon it's only good through Halloween ooh thirty one [laughter] so uh I'm going to get an extra five dollars off solar ray products\nThe a micro biome thirty how probiotics right in the refrigerator case right here to help habit so five dollars off until him through the thirty first they'll come in and get them\nHalloween the news\nAnd I know the heat I wanted to also ask because you've got such great formula here now you also have a colon formula can you go into who should be taking the polling for millennia formula yeah it's Monday\n[laughter] I Know right Colin well the would be I guess you know he definitely has about you're going to think of just pulling issues in general white if you're having a hard time going in the restroom that could be things like diarrhea which probiotics are always going to help you with things of that nature so if you want to

some news here this morning and it's going on and why I was talking about what's happening with our economy don't get nervous\nThese things don't happen in the day but you can set yourself up for success in most people\nDon't set themselves up for success I was having a conversation in the morning or yesterday with some very liberal people and here's what we're finally came down to it because they started calling me I mean it's like\nListen hey you're the one that contacted me so money knows no politics listen to this money knows no politics it doesn't know whether you're white\nRead like me brown like me black\nAsian whatever any color you are it does it know that it doesn't know whether you're Catholic Protestant Jewish Muslim it has no none of that stuff Buddha whatever you call Buddhism\nSpirituality it does it know none of that stuff doesn't know whether you're short\nTall\nDoesn't know whether you're patterns like mayor skinny little Indian didn't know it\nDoesn't know whether you're rich and it doesn't know whether you're poor money only knows trading hands that's it\nIt's a means of getting what we want but it's only knows trading hands okay\nSo what that said most people that I tell him that and I said hey can we agree on that whole man the conversation when death silent I mean it was deafening death funding\nIt doesn't know whether you're Catholic Protestant Jewish Muslim it has no none of that stuff Buddha whatever you call Buddhism spirituality it doesn't know none of that stuff but doesn't know whether you're short\nOr tall\nMoney doesn't know whether you're patterns like mayor skinny fat little Indian didn't know it\nIt doesn't know whether you're rich and it doesn't know whether you're poor money only knows trading hands that's it\nIt's a means of getting what we want but it's only knows trading hands okay\nSo with that said most people that I tell him that and I said hey\nCan we agree on that whole man the conversation when death silence I mean was deafening death funding you could have heard a pin drop on the carpet\n'cause then they had to regroup and assess their thinking because people get seriously money politics those are things that in religion those are things that they get people in a fist fight seriously seriously angry at you\nOr they won't even talk to you anymore so I just laid it out\nThere you go hit took them a while and we agreed to separate and we talk later\nThat we talk of several hours later that day and they go you know what we ... we never looked at it that way it only knows to problems over trade and hands we only know trading hand we only know what we know here's one\nThing that I Try to tell her by and this is what I learned from a billionaire who's going to a program he's in a spiritual program he tells me he said and early on when I was getting sober thirty two years ago he says uh David\nContempt\nInvestigation will keep a person\nAn everlasting ignorance and poverty\nAnd if you want to be that the pride for being with all that was me I can still be that way I'm constantly praying to God humbled me\nHelped me stay home but I don't asking the humble and boy he will\nHelp me stay humble gimme wisdom knowledge and understanding and let me move forward money is a byproduct so anyway let's get back to the point now taking the babbled long enough about that\nI could go all day on this stuff I seriously most people do not take pen to paper\nYou got to sit down with your wife or your husband or your financial advisors and has some serious talks and I was talking to one of my guys at work with ... Mike this morning mind a military investigator by the way I have some of the best\nCitizen journalists in the world were broken five national news stories Fox News picked up two of 'em okay anyway let's get back to the point here most people don't put pen to paper you gotta put pen to paper talk to your advisors and then spend like\nAn hour a day now if you spend an hour a day in thirty days you're going to have what thirty hours that's a lot of hours\nIn a year and you can have three hundred and fifty six hours put into your personal finance\nI Want you to stop and think how many hours or how much time a year you actually put into your personal finance not worrying about it not watching it go up and down but actually putting pen to paper and making a strategy in a plan and put some goals in place to go in place right the planning between those goals and start working it\nAnd then spend like an hour a day now have you spend an hour a day in thirty days you're going to have what thirty hours that's a lot of hours in a year you're going to three hundred and fifty six hours put into your personal finance\nI Want you to stop and think how many hours or how much time a year you actually put into your personal finance not worrying about it not watching it go up and down but actually putting pen to paper and making a strategy in a plan and put some goals in place but a going place\nOr did become billionaires and the thousand airs did to become millionaires so you've got your a thousand there\nAnd you do the same thing that the billionaires during the you become a millionaire and the millionaires do the same thing that the billionaires do and then they become hundred millionaires or ten millionaires fifty millionaires hundred millionaires and then some of them become billionaires but you got to do the same strategies and it's not that hard and anybody with a business can do it\nAll right let me get off of that hundred Ninety two million dollar for those dirty bitcoin thirty thousand back on the game so we're looking at making some trades like that are out there it's just a matter of putting pen to paper see what you got and pulling the trigger now let me get back to one of these stories okay because we are talking\nUm [noise] and here we are where are we at Mike Mike semi some stories here All right we're done with that story and we get back to this one where we're at you want to ... a a a news on Monday here we go All right\nSo Tim Draper let me get back to so I set the story of a famous venture capital investor\nIn bitcoin advocate have predicted bitcoin would reach two hundred and fifty thousand by twenty twenty two well I think it's going to hit it about twenty twenty because it's going to have\nAs soon as it has it's going to become one solid store value and you're going to want to own some coin you can buy with us and then we can do it together okay that that's what I recommend but you could do what you want to do\nA a note here Draper is one who bought the Silk Road bitcoin from the federal government which I talked about earlier okay so he didn't get the Silk Road but he got the confiscated coin\nAlright Draper for further added that the market capitalization of crypto currency would be close to ten trillion dollars well I'd say there's gonna be eighty trillion\nIt's more like an eighty trillion\nNow he's a billionaire or ... in the market guy you know investment guy\nHe these guys think differently because they're looking at the the um the securities end of it this is totally different and he's getting it but you're not going to hear anybody in the world talk about it like I Do okay it's going to end the reason is is it's inflationary\nStore a value and you're going to want to own some point you can buy with us and then we can do it together okay that that's what I'd recommend but you can do what you want to do a\nA note here Draper is one who bought the Silk Road bitcoin from the federal government which I talked about earlier okay so he didn't get the cells grow but he got the confiscated going All right so Draper for further added that the market capitalization of crypto currency would be close to ten trillion dollars while I said it was going to be a trillion\nIt's more like an eighty trillion now he's a billionaire in the market guy you know investment guy\nHe these guys think differently because they're looking at the um the security is the end of it this is totally different and he's getting it but you're not going to hear anybody in the world talk about it like I Do okay it's going to end the reason is is it's inflationary\nNot it's not it's not inflationary it's deflation airy the stock market securities the hot paper money it's inflationary the more you make it causes inflation and more\nCrypto currency is deflation area which means the more you put into it the money's still stays there because there's no more printing of it\nIt gets divided boy it gets divided it's already there it's already there on line all you do it fraction it out\nSo once again for those of you joining us for the first time the the fly Mackey show and I'm your house fly Mackey and we talk about bitcoin we're also President Trump Bible bumping NRA type show that's my mentality\nSo I was arguing with some liberals earlier a ... why do I get into those arguments it's ridiculous you know people want to argue that point here's the deal if you're joining us for the first time money knows no politics zero it only knows trading hands\nSo if you're putting your politics behind your money you're going to lose\nSimple as that don't do it it's the dumbest thing in the world is the bet on politics don't put your bet don't put your financial future if you love your wife or you love your husband or you love your children\nYou're not going to take a hammer and hit them in the towel with it well that's what we do and we put our politics in the way of money money only knows trading hands now the love of money's the root of all evil were not loving it over here but it's a way that we have to pay things\nYou want something you have to have it in order to make a transaction okay so there's nothing wrong with being smart of it that's why I say take an hour a day\nMake plans put pen to paper and I say this all the time put pen to paper and make a plan\nYour first your right to go writes them go and they make a plan to reach each one of those goals and I never thought you become a millionaire I'll tell you this the first time I got there I was like there is no way\nAnd then I was\nTwenty and I go ... that wasn't that hard [laughter]\nOh boy my dad I had a different strategy his was do do everything at it let's see if it works in ... worked for him a lot mother was very conservative Jewish mother Irish Catholic father oh boy Native American kid they adopted me try being a fly on the wall no pun intended those conversations [laughter]\nI didn't know whether I was coming and going anyway hey it is what it is but in the paper right those goals down and then make a plan\nTo reach each one of those puts them goes out there where you never thought you could make it one time I was so wealthy and I gave my well so am I and I we work give her money when they um we were so wealthy at one time\nI was like there is no way and then I

one of their is you have Twitter Facebook you of Instagram as a matter of fact if a bunch of different social media platforms there was another platform called the gab\nOperates similarly to\nTwitter as I understand it\nBut they promised no censorship right\nOr corporate censorship rather I think it's a more appropriate\nPhrase to you know let me share this with you because\nNut job murderer\nThis anti Semite who shot up the synagogue\nShe had to count\nApparently on everything he had to count on Facebook on Twitter he was verified on Twitter\nHe had an account on gab okay\nThis let me open this up\nBand social media platform gab this was a headline after it was revealed that the synagogue murder\nWas a heavy user who posted often about his hatred of Jews\nAnd he posted a lot\nReally awful awful stuff\nThe same stuff that he also posted he posted something similar and same stuff on Twitter\nReally awful stuff on Twitter\nHe it just awful\nSo a spokesman for pay pal confirmed that the company canceled gab the count [noise]\nThey said that there are allowing the the perpetuation of hate violence or discriminatory intolerance\nAnd so they canceled their account\nAnd it and there are other tech companies now as well\nDumping or trying to de platform them\nA go daddy drops gab they gave them twenty four hours to find a new host\nOr completely just beat the platform from the the

they don't have the terms of service they're they're just it's like a free speech free for all\nThat you had pay pal stripe medium everybody's dropped a gab\nThey looking\nAt any other so yeah there were all\nThis this murderer also had Twitter account\nHe was on Twitter he was verified and he said the same stuff on Twitter\nHe said the same thing the same ignorant awful things\nMeanwhile the guy\nThe bomber Caesar or the ... name that\nHe apparently was also on Twitter and Facebook where he posted ridiculous stuff\nAnd he also threatened to threaten people with death\nSometimes I get so many deaths I've already gotten ... death threats because of the stuff\nSometimes you never know which ones are serious and which ones are not to just have to send them all\nI don't understand\nAnd the and the threats that had been\nOn Twitter by the bomber they were ignored\nAnd the murderer who went and shot up the synagogue said some pretty awful stuff on Twitter as well apparently\nIt is just\nI mean it's inconsistent the treatment of Twitter Facebook and then this lesser known service gab\nWhere you had anti Semitic an insane remarks that were shared all of these services but why is only one penalize\nI don't understand that why is only one penalize am I missing something\nAm I missing something came to mind is seen anything why is winding penalize that's what I don't understand when you started\nColumbus they they need a scapegoat and they certainly don't want to use Twitter\nI mean they need some sort of scapegoat to show some sort of responsibility right I guess I have no idea yeah\nDon't know a right it's a little inconsistent it's incredibly inconsistent\nIt's super inconsistent\nAnd it just doesn't\nThat doesn't make any sense\nIs it really about\nThe idea of
