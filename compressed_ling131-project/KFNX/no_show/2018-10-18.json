saying so here we are in the imperfect world try to bring some shots of perfection innocent perfect world and we're talking about topics that most people are not interested in it\nBecause I Would instead immediately shifted the word immigration\nImmigration immigration immigration tons are is\nYou'd be interested more and you you might want to actually you should\nBecause as I said today

it coming from a FM you have to dig very hard to get any answers on this at all\nBecause it's very serious that can lead to paralysis and deaths in children\nOn October fourth health officials in

from these third world countries in plain English common sense would dictate you know let a disease partially then your country\nI common sense if you have a house or apartment we let someone with a a communicable disease in your apartment unless you're a moron and San Francisco and San Francisco probably sleep with the person with a communicable disease to show it a good life just they were very

think look I exist in this business because of one reason a\nI'm offering you something that you're buying let's put it to you that way and you don't you think about it\nWhen you really thinking about what us talk radio ... which talk radio shows are successful and which aren't which are long lasting and which aren't it's no longer related to um whether you survive in this business or not it's no wonder related to ratings for example a New York uh WABC I had the highest ratings for years I had any for three straight\nBut they want to go in another direction you only hear me into your come January unless you either ... or or for another station or you'll listen to my podcast my writings were great that wasn't the reason it's all politics I Can't do anything about it\nThere's nothing I can do about the politics of the ownership of stations do you understand that I don't own a stations they could run Mickey Mouse playing it because you if they wanted for three hours in in in a slot that I was going to do sound better than Mickey Mouse or the zoo\nAnd you can say what do you want but you don't have any control over it doesn't matter if the show loses money doesn't matter at all that matters is that the agenda is push forward especially going into twenty twenty when they get they're gearing up ready for the presidential election\nSo the only reason you listen to me at all is why\nWell you figure this guy's a little different sometimes it comes down on this side of a of a subject sometimes that and it seems like he does it based on a reason not just on on a desire to please us and he doesn't sit for three hours saluting Trump\nWhich you can gag on that one because I did not Trump that I'm angry at it's the talk show host who thinks that that's all you want to hear that the part that bothers me what would you do if if Obama was president and you ought to talk\nIf they wanted for three hours in in in a slot that I was and we're not going to do sound better than Mickey Mouse where they can do\nAnd you can say whatever you want but you don't have any control over it doesn't matter if the show loses money doesn't matter at all that matters is that the agenda is

you do if if Obama was president and you had a talk show that for three straight hours it's diluted how great Obama was Obama was there so but I'm always great Obama shoes shine ... probably than anyone shoe bomber was smarter how could you listen to that did you listen to it no\nNo the the companies that specialize in left wing propaganda\nIn radio one out of business and then when they lost their jobs they came over to the other stations and they started to get rid of conservatives taking them off the air you don't know any of this oh yeah it's a well known fact in the business\nPeople destroyed their networks by running left wing propaganda and now running other media now did you know that even in radio well in one day you'll you'll learn more about it if it's false I wouldn't say it to you so how do you survive at all in this business if you're a truth teller\nThe people will find you one way or the other\nIs that simple they'll find your on line or they'll find you on a podcast or they'll string it from somewhere that's that's how it is so is that that's the way it is now ... what are we going to talk about let's go to I didn't take a call I got this one of these days I don't know why it's so good\nI Know why I feel good extra extra clear it's like a clear like Scientology a clear I don't I'm not a psychologist but I Know one guy was in it\nEarly on back in Queens he went into it\nOne of the nuts and the crowd\nStar but he made a fortune became a top guy and sinus I was surprised it went so high up in this thing\nBut he wasn't like kids Eighteen everyone's trying to find themselves he became a Scientology I'm Talking ... like in the sixties and I'll wake up twenties ladies like one of the chief school rules in Scientology movement but I remember the guy there were certain things they said they were really good\nLike about headaches for example I have suffered migraine since I was a kid\nAnd he tried to have me image the headache and where it came from it actually helped me\nOr really helped my migraines and self cured\nWas reading Georgia sours than Mac robotics and I went on to the ten stage diet of elimination I was Eighteen years old and on my own I found out which which food types trigger migraines\nAnd I rarely get a migraine today unless I slip on that diet for me it was sucrose any any refined sugars will do it for example and I know why exactly because my brain runs very hot and very fast\nAnd if it's like throwing rocket fuel into an engine\nI mean that engine will run on it\nBut you're going to burn the engine out with my brain was sending back a single I'm going to give you a headache so you don't burn through fast and burn up that seat that's right feedback in your body and your brain if you if you learn how to listen to the signal and you want to understand that\nIf you learn how to listen to your own signaling from your brain and your body you actually could could lead yourself to states have health that you could never even believe were were possible but and here is the but\nMost of us have lost contact with the signals we don't want to hear them we've we've eliminated them\nAnd we put your budget or whatever where they would do is I've learned to listen to my body over the years it's not always a nice message [laughter] sometimes I don't want to hear what it has to say to me like don't drink ... shut up leave me alone you know\nFor example and I know why exactly because my brain runs very hot and very fast and if it's like throwing rocket fuel into an engine\nI mean that engine will run on it but you're going to burn the engine out whether it's in my brain was sending back a single I'm going to give you a headache so you don't burn through fast and burn up the seat that's right feedback and your body and your brain if you if you learn how to listen to the signal and you want to understand that\nIf you learn how to listen to your own signaling from your brain and your body you actually could could lead yourself to states of health that you could never even believe were were possible but and here's the but\nMost of us have lost contact with these signals we don't want to hear them we've we've eliminated them\nWe put your budget or whatever what he would do\nIs I've learned to listen to my body over the years it's not always a nice message [laughter] sometimes I don't want to hear what it has to say to me like don't drink ... shut up leave me alone you know I don't ... don't drink that rockets not good for you today whatever but I I listen all very close relationship\nSo I took this an acrobatic diet did elimination of sucrose insured my headache and the rest is history for me it doesn't mean for you maybe you love sucrose maybe like getting diabetes and cancer\nAnd heart disease I Can't stop you if that's what you want\nPeople do crazy things today based on science so the reason I'm happy today on radio was I was able to use\nMy my learning\nMy dissertation going back to Nineteen Seventy eight in the ... study studies that I was interested in them and the relationship to Lou Gehrig's disease today\nAnd the statement by Steven all kinds of God doesn't exist because he died of allies I figured that would be interesting but do I know if you really listening or maybe you listen to have it already I don't know you're going to turn off the list in that habit by now because you could hear everything you've ever wanted to know about the administration are graded is around the clock\n... bat\nThat part down the middle of his

time to read them again and again because there's so much\nInformation in each book\nTonight sketched is humor\nAnd Bernie stories and just as an example of some of the questions Bernie and list is what are some of the benefits of humor\nPhysically emotionally and mentally and cute and can humor be considered a natural medicine for healing process\nTo the show Bernie thank you my dear\nYeah I'm so convinced about humor because I did see the benefits as a visitation I saw the benefits are with all my patients and one of the things I found interesting was that\nMany times I Will meet patients\nWho you know I'm no longer practice things innovation anymore but will be you know going shopping or sitting at the vet a waiting room and they come over and say remember me and what they remember is the humor\nUm I might say the loving the humor that those two things\nAnd how they were able to survive a in a lot less painful way are due to the love and the laughter and I always say that [noise] if you're laughing\nYou can't be afraid mhm here he is not an issue when you're laughing\nAnd I mean that literally just disconnects you from the fear and this is why I Would use it all the time with my patients so they wouldn't\nUh confronted disease you know what's gonna happen to me\nOr an operation with fear or they'd go in with a smile on their face and I'm always come out far better as a matter of fact one of the nurses says to me your patients that are a problem I said my patients are a problem what is it\nThey refuse pain medication\nI said did it ever occur to you they're not hurting\nI always say that [noise] if you're laughing\nYou can't be afraid mhm here is not an issue when you're laughing\nAnd I mean that literally just disconnects you from the fear and this is why I Would use it all the time with my patient so they wouldn't uh confronted disease you know what's gonna happen to me\nOr an operation with fear or they'd go in with a smile on their face and I'm always come out far better as a matter of fact one of the nurses said to me if patients that are a problem I said my patients are problem what is it\nThey refuse pain medication\nI said did it ever occur to use it not hurting\nShe looks at me like I was insane because I've been doing major surgery on people and they're not hurting\nBut they they weren't\nI mean in terms of pain they weren't in pain there may have been ... or\n\n[noise]\nWell welcome to the matter with Dr Bernie Segal during the break or earning they talking about you mentioned about research which is I find interesting research as far as what's happens to the body what's it mentally physically emotionally or\nYeah one of the medical students at the university I don't know if he's medical psychology but you know in that in the health field um\nEight do this professor for his faces when\nHe wanted to do was\nGet a couple of actors and while they were acting draw their blood to show how the chemistry in their body was authored by the role that they were portrayed as fast they really didn't believe it would do anything\nBut he gets thank God he gave him a mission there's so many ... as they know that it's crazy I Can't say that I'm so he got a male and female and gave them to script one script was\nThe male a character was murder or who had killed the woman's husband and they meet\nAnd the other was a comedy routine that they both played out and he drove the blood while they stood there reading the script\nOf actors and while they were acting draw their blood to show how the chemistry in their body was offered by the role that they were four train and it's a fascinating really didn't believe it would do anything\nBut he ... thank God he gave him permission there's so many preventive is saying now that it's crazy I Can't say that I'm so he got a male and female and gave them to script one script was\nThe male a character was murder or who had killed the woman's husband and they meet and the other was a comedy routine disabled as laid out and he drove abroad while they stood there reading the script\nAnd of course when it was done and they analyzed abroad in the tragedy like the murder scene the blood levels for stress hormone levels went way up\nAnd the\nHormone levels induced immune function went way down you know again you know I always say you can see why Monday morning as a negative effect on people if you don't like what's happening to you if the presses immune function elevate stress hormone level\nThen he gave them the comedy routine\nAnd drew their blood and of course the opposite happened there stress hormone levels went down a little bit cortisone levels\nAnd the immune function popped right up and so again if you laugh and and this this also is a study I think it was done in one of the Scandinavian countries breast cancer patients who were told to laugh for no\nApparent reason mhm just every three hours lab for no reason for several minutes\nWhen they were studied at the end of I don't know actually was probably a few years that this study went on but at the end of the very end of this study there were more survivors from the last two grew than there were from the control group\nThere's a control group who simply told you know if something funny happens fine you can laugh but don't laugh for no reason and\nIt shows the difference in survival between those who left for no reason and those who laughed only if something funny happened so again you say then I Need to bring more numerous things into my life and they always say yeah keep the kid in you alive\nMeant child always finds things to laugh at 'em and and it doesn't have to be anything structure where the clever it's\nJust something that gets you smiling and giggling and and just little things that kids know\nYou know work and are will make them smile and laugh and if it's sort of a silliness but it's a healthy silliness so you feel comfortable being the child in acting\nA little funny and how's the people's smiling you because you're doing those things\nI mean I keep thinking all the crazy simple things that I say you know he he whether it's sign here and I right here on a piece of paper um for what for that that I Love you know you see that sign wet floor it's most no warning\nIt doesn't have to be anything structured woody clever it's just something that gets you smiling\nAnd giggling and and just little things that kids know\nYou know work and a will make them smile and laugh and if it's sort of a silliness but it's a healthy silliness so you feel comfortable being the child than acting\nA little funny and how's that people smiling you because you're doing those things\nI mean I keep thinking all the crazy simple things I say you know he he whether it's signed he earned it right here on a piece of paper um for what for\nThat that I Love you know you see that sign wet for its most no warn you that the floor is wet but it doesn't say floor wet it says wet floor so I always watch the floor\nPeople look at you and I say well I'm just trying to make you happy and I still have the science so I wiped the floor [laughter] oh I Love that one that's and the kids in school love it you know there's always\nPeople mopping up and cleaning up and then they put a sign up ... floor and the all white and I say to the kids don't forget what floor you know what to do is give me that look like oh you're not what are you doing does ...\nBut the kids no I'm kidding and it just their eyes\nLight up and having a good time or someone who's made them smile\nSo it's interesting very good as you're saying we remember more humorous things in life or they stand out more\nI Know I understand is that you know you have various stuff you know at a time\nI was thinking how significant that is right\nYou're a patient in the hospital you like them to know you as a person now there's room for twenty two right you know or cars film with the colon and you're not a person\nYou see a ... there's no you don't put it this way the diagnosis helps the doctor it doesn't help the patient there the key thing is the story you want to be a story for you Dr nurses whether you're in the office\nOr in the hospital so they know you as a person and I think that's why it's so important to behave in that kind of independent\nManner and not be\nA submissive suffer ... that's where the word patient is derived from\nA submissive suffer oh if if you're a submissive suffer you're in big trouble and not kind of survivor yeah right right but if anyone would I follow what's the\nWord I made a um a a responsible participant a resident R. E. S. P. A. and the nice thing become a restaurant\nYou're responsible participant so you participate you take responsibility you not just lying there let people do things to you or that have nothing to do with your desires but\nThey're treating a disease that they're doing mhm and uh\nWithout any understanding of who you are as a human being that's right\nYou want to be identified mhm is that human being and are now the human doing with the human being ... and ah and you can be who you want to be and that they can come to respect you for that mhm\nYeah that's interesting because if they're giving you win\nIn a restaurant are ESPN the missing become a respite\nYou're responsible participant so you participate you take responsibility you not just lying there let people do things to you or that have nothing to do with your desires but they're treating a disease so that they're doing ... and uh\nWithout any understanding of who you are as a human being\nRight you want to be identified mhm is that human being and are\nNot a human doing for a human being mhm and ah and you can be who you belong to be and uh they can come to respect you for that mhm\nYeah that's interesting because if they're giving you a number like we're ten twenty two ... walking in and the assistant in doing the mechanics of it and not even recognizing the human being and not only\nThat they may give you the wrong number ... who is there a lot of people who received the wrong medications and literally die because of it because the hospital makes a mistake\nThey confuse room numbers or or they talk about a diagnosis instead of a patient's name you know they say here this is really the lady with breast cancer well why don't you say the person's\nName right ... yeah you know because if if the nurse walks into the wrong room you might kill somebody given them more meant for the person in the next room so it's always important to make sure everybody identify you and if they want to you know and I mean this I don't care if they call me and NOT gate\nYou know what I mean what am I have my name my actual name 'em\nThen I Know I'll be treated as that person\n[noise] um so I don't care whether they have you know what you call some derogatory title like the nut case I'd rather be the nut case then have somebody make a mistake about me and who I Am and what disease I have and\nHow they're treating me yeah [noise] that's so\nImportant so import mechanical versus human yeah\nAnd there's always a mystery involved ... recently as I said I was in the hospital and I knew I'd be fine that my wife is watching\nOver right why she's born on nine nine mhm\nMarried on seven eleven I get to the hospital what room did they put me in in the emergency room number nine oh how interesting\nGet upstairs he put me in eight one nine ... years and Andrea Hsu nine right they take me to do a procedure\nYou mentioned that he's going to room eleven oh my good is it ... it gets so mystical ... and I always feel like oh my wife is taking care of everything [laughter] you know right in right to put me in the right places that the right thing right\nTake me to do a procedure you mentioned that he's going to ruin eleven on line is it ... it gets so mystical and I always feel like oh my wife is taking care of everything [laughter] you know right and then put me in the right places and the right thing right\nShifts blood just as I said just as it's another emotion they range is your body chemistry so when you fearful there is more blood going the muscles so you can you know fight for your life and run and do things um\nGoing to certain areas of the brain that will help you physically do scape something rather than to think and analyze and you know being in love at that moment isn't going to do much but being afraid of a rabid dog can get\nYou away and save your life\nSo the emotion of it\nPropels one that's right yeah because he ran gentle even lie in other words you I mean we've all read these stories where\nSomebody's car collapses you know on a on a family member and this person lift the car\nAnd you say why you lifted the car and they did\nThey raised it announced a person can get out you know and save their life but you say how do you get that strength well it's motivated by the fear\nThat there's going to be the loss of life of a loved one so what chargers insurgents through your body oh you to do things you would never be able to do if I said you go out to the garage and lift the car so I could change that dire\nYou'd say Modi nuts but if your loved one was lying under their you lift the damn thing and get that person out\n... I don't have a very protective side of ourselves yeah yeah\nSurvival is built into\nRight I mean you know God is thought about these things I always say if you got your finger isn't\nLeading you know those things have built into us so it's important to keep all those mechanisms\nFunctioning so they are there to protect you and they carry you but when you're in a panic when you're in fear it confuses your body ... doesn't know what to do to protect you\nI'm a all those mechanisms are they say confused and doing the wrong things often because they don't know what you're thinking\nOh to increase his blood pressure\nRight\nYeah yeah survival is built into\nRight I mean you know God is thought about these things I always say if you got your finger is not leaving you know\nThings have built into us so it's important to keep all those mechanisms\nFunctioning so they are there to protect you and they carry you but when you're in a panic when you're in fear it confuses your body ... doesn't know what to do to protect you\nUm ... all those mechanisms are they say confused and doing the wrong things often because they don't know what you're thinking\nOh to increase his blood pressure\nRight\nYeah right yeah you're you're more likely to have the artist that Monday morning ... who are disgusted with your job and do my own or work\nOr then when you love what you're doing and look forward to going out in the street and are seeing the world I always tell people to build shrines in their own homes to put a picture themselves up when they were young and cute and when you walk by a picture of yourself\nLoves the kids love yourself and that love\nAnd um it makes a difference because mhm every day day after day you take two minutes and you give yourself a little love but it it gets through believe me\n[noise] because it's it's also very joyful when we're younger\n... really different type of a human being that yeah I think you're right you know we don't have all that baggage stuff some of us have on more than all of this but and it's smiling usually children always smiling\nWell the kids what I've found was if you're honest with them mhm um or at least you thought they thought you would be honest they believe view so\nI always used the way I express things and said things for the kids benefit in other words telling them what was going to be good now what was going to go wrong or be bad or the pain or\nYeah I always focused on the good things mhm so the kids games to expect the good things to happen I rather than the bad yeah mhm mhm\nI mean if something came up as a complication ... I can say I'm Sorry this is unexpected I'm Sorry\nBut you'll do fine\nI'm so they were mad at me if I didn't tell them every detail of everything that happened to them and that would be worse\n... and they don't hold it in\nRight all the kids don't right they they want to get mad at you they'll get mad at you write a love that yeah\nRight right right they get mad and then they forget about it yeah hold on hold on to write and I say well we're going to continue or\nA Bernie I'm thinking about the next the next segment for you\nAnd the listeners uh we've been listening to the doctor Bernie Segal retired surgeon with so many interesting so many interesting stories or you could write books and books and this burning books and books [noise] um [laughter] yeah\nWhen you look at it right you know I'm Still right okay [laughter] well we're going to be right back with Dr Bernie say going no matter the heart\nRight they want to get mad at you they'll get mad at you\nLook back yeah right right right\nRight they get mad and then they forget about it yeah I don't hold on to write I say well we're going to continue a Bernie I'm thinking about the next the next segment for you and the listeners [noise]\nWe've been listening to Dr Bernie Segal retired surgeon with so many interesting so many interesting stories you could write books and books and this burning books and books\n[laughter] I don't when you look at it right you know I'm Still right okay [laughter] well we're going to be right back with Dr Bernie say go no matter eleven hundred I Am\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou trying to get ready for emotional\nWill be listening when nine PM through all of you for help you yourself from past week it opened the window of special and unique like huge story to bring awareness to her look toward the mineral heart every Wednesday nights\nWith Carol with us in just like Bernie you your heart you're listening to the better of the heart every Wednesday night you know I'm an independent taco living\nHundred lifting loves you going to be\nThere are lots of good reason to take a good quality multivitamin even the best eating plants can fall short of meeting all of the necessary nutrients you need each day enrolled laboratories offering different multivitamin formulas which central the men's women's and the needle formulas to meet individual needs\nEach formula contains co enzyme activated forms a beach you meet zipped into like I said I'll be on minerals the gold standard in mineral key light\nVitamin K n n K seven and full spectrum mixed a cough or all took a tree in all ... ...\n... is one of the standout nutrient Denise formula and forty six percent of the U.S population did not process but like asking properly putting them at greater risk for premature a heart attack and drunk depression and even get the ... picking he won the the multivitamin isn't easy way to fill in small nutritional gap\nLearn more about emerald laboratories science states multivitamin formula by going to travel laboratory dot com that ultra laboratory dot com\nThat's our ...\nOur our child we lose an arm\nYou where you are I'm sure if you're on\nIn the world [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nTo be a member of serving proud to serve in\n\n[noise] I have a job where you know you're on\nIn the world\n\n[noise]\n\nMembers serving and I'm proud of the ...\n\nListen to help helps cost Arizona's most popular my mom's talk radio show\nFeaturing functionally integrated medicine right here on TALK after nine eleven hundred am\nSponsored by healthy healthy\nBusiness realty I'm\nListening in every Wednesday afternoon from four to five pm to your financial our hosted by Andy Paladino for trips and ideas on financial in retirement planning your financial our Wednesday's four to five PM right here on independent talk of loving hundred ...

decided to have her DNA tested and then she saw the results and she saw that she was\nAs little as one one thousand Native American which is actually lower than the average person who lives on the north American continent and then\nShe and her staff I assume she consulted with her staff said let's give this to the Boston Globe and let them put it on the front page and that will convince everybody that I Am in fact the Native American I claimed so I could get that sweet job at Harvard a\nL brought a joins me now who's managing editor of the stream\nNow welcome back to the program and\nDo do you think that Elizabeth Warren made a big mistake and is it big enough to take her out of the presidential sweepstakes\nWell compared to Custer that huge mistake but er [noise] it what it did is it definitely lowered or stock I mean if I'm putting money on two thousand two thousand twenty democratic race she just she just got a ... she blew it in a way 'cause she\nIt it's not so much that that is what how she did it it's one thing to take the test I'm Glad you took the test that's cool and I'm Glad she's proud that there's some that blood in there but to to try to use it as a slam dunk against Trump\nWas in it was stupid and she looked silly and when you look silly once that gets into the the cultural divide you're in trouble like Cory Cory bookers Spartacus thing you're in trouble you know you're you're already ... you're going to take down Trump with that kind of thing I mean come on ... the only thing really did\nShe really really did some damage to herself with this and it was self inflicted too and and that she could have done at least the details in a way to put ... you know put away the issue that she didn't do it in prisons are smart enough to do that as part of the president\nThe other thing is now at some level I think she knows that she's not Native American and I think she's ... twenty twelve when it was question and she came up with inadequate a proof of it and I think this would have been an opportunity I could even see\nUh if if you had a staff willing to stand up for themselves and say to the boss and I know it's tough says Abbas boss you're wrong here's what you should do you should go out and said this has been an issue since ...\nYou're in trouble you know you're you're already ... you're going to take down Trump with that kind of thing I mean come on ... the only thing really did\nShe really really did some damage to herself with this and it was self inflicted too and and that she could have done at least the details in a way to put ... you know put away the issue and she didn't do it in prisons are smart enough to do that is it's going to be president\nWell the other thing is is out at some level I think she knows that she's not Native American and I think she's known them since twenty twelve when it was questioned then she came up with an adequate a proof of it and I think this would have been an opportunity I could even see\nUh if if she had a staff willing to stand up for themselves and say to the boss and I know it's tough says Abbas boss you're wrong here's what you should do you should go out and say this has been an issue since ... who was brought up in that election campaign\nAnd I've now during a test and I found out that I'm only at most three percent Native American so you know what I was wrong and if she had done that\nAnd and use that as soon as she still would have been able to say to the public I'm I'm maybe as much as three percent Native American\nBut I was wrong to claim that Native American status I didn't do it for any bad reason I think she did do it for a bad reason to advance or sell financially and professionally but she could do that\nAnd I think America what is it oh okay and then it would have disappeared as an issue\nWell here you go and she had the perfect and she has a perfect um hook is he the ancestry dot com there's ancestry dot com commercial where some guy say for all my life we thought we were German we went to the you know October fest dressed up and then we found that were Seventy percent Irish\nOr whatever I've seen a commercial out there that that deals with this she does a spoof of that commercial or what I mean that's the way out there a little bit but still be I\nWill not do it well no you're on the right track culture you're on the right track out imagine if she'd said hey you know that ancestry commercial is the guy who thought he was Irish and then he founded is these are tallying instead well\nGuess what I found out I'm In the same boat and I think people would have laughed they would have said well OK and we'll let bygones be bygones I've seen politicians do it but so few of the I Want your view on this so few politicians seem capable of saying hey you know what\nI was wrong about that but I Apologize and are no hard feelings right and and then by twenty twenty if anybody like me tried to bring this thing back up again they say hey she dealt with that she said she was wrong why don't you let that wouldn't go\nYeah I heard you're exactly right hurt her tax would have been to like under play under play what ...\nUnder play the relationship and they said ... admits she made the ... and ... she made a mistake and people on it because\nIt again like you said if he made a little bit of light of it and she she wouldn't look foolish there wouldn't be the means out there and that that that are gonna be just as devastating as Dukakis on that tank you know\nOh my God you all boy and the ... when you say that the picture comes back to my but the other thing or two years later Thirty years he's still knows he looks like a feel for and Everytime I go to an email from Howard Dean and I'm Still getting ... emails not personally but you know the solicitations I think about that scream\nOr whatever it was he said that night that in one moment one big scream ended his entire and he was the hot prospect but here's the other thing that bugs me about it now you tell me what you think\nWe hire presidents and senators and governors to make great decisions and we expect them to to be done in a way that serves all of us and sometimes they involve the life and death sending people to war spending huge amounts of money sinking the country into debt or getting us out\nSo when we hire people to make a really great decisions and then we see someone like Elizabeth Warren make\nBoy and the ... when you say that the picture comes back to my but the other thing or two years later Thirty years he's still knows he looks like a fuel for and Everytime I go to an email from Howard Dean and I'm Still getting ... emails not personally but you know the solicitations I think about that scream\nOr whatever it was he said that night that in one moment one big scream ended his entire and he was the hot prospect but here's the other thing that bugs me about it now you tell me what you think\nWe hire presidents and senators and governors to make great decisions and we expect them to to be done in a way that serves all of us and sometimes they involve the life and death sending people to war spending huge amounts of money sinking the country and the debt or getting us out\nSo when we hire people to make a really great decisions and then we see someone like Elizabeth Warren make a colossally bad this she's had six years to think about it she gets the new data and and rather than saying\nYou know I probably have to admit I was just wrong and that this is my excuse to do it she makes a colossally bad mistake\nAnd then says by the way would you like me making mistakes from the most powerful office in the world\nYou know what what's interesting is as you're talking I'm remembering what I guess as chief of staff Kelly said about her a couple of weeks ago how he she was arrogant and of course you took that as well be strong to the president blah blah blah you know\nThis is just you know that's a general generals used to that you know tough people you know it's a color arrogant and say that that's the key to this this thing if the arrogance of thinking well I've got the the media behind me I'm going to do this and I'm going to jump on Trump that's I think some of the key to\nPeter why she thought this would be a good idea and in doing it again it the way she did\nThere's all there's also I think comedy is in her ... you can't give yourself a nickname so if if Cory Booker wanted to beat Spartacus he needed to arrange for somebody else to call them Spartacus when you call yourself Spartacus doesn't quite work as well\nYeah yeah and that's and that's the thing and they're all all these people are trying to all these Democrats who are thinking about two dozen twenty\nAll trying to nudge their way to the front of the pack in her case I think he's trying to be the foil to Trump see I got him I got well you don't like them all when you're up you're losing sixty four to nothing you know one sixty fourth Indian and it's like being down sixty four to nothing spiking the ball you look stupid\nYou know but that study that twenty twenty or so focused on that you're not taking care of business and doing what you need to do to win\nSo tell me this goes back to the presidency now do you think this takes her out of it or does she find a way to stay in it because I mean that would be God's Gift to talk radio I'll admit but not not great for the country or does this clear the path from for Joe Biden would say\nThat it makes things easier for

don't\nReally at all that and then they were talking also about\nUm what they say is taking the fact that I sit there and I said my doctor for it on at the end and better was saying that um that\nDonald Trump himself to clarify that ended up in a minute that he um did it\nOn that ... that Kevin I wouldn't have made it if\nIt had not been for you know but he was sane at the rally that'll

her lap and they will not be what the rally to laugh at Dr Ford does he have enough men and I say I don't know that that they\nEnjoy knee joint\nTake a break and just let me ask you a couple of questions do you agree that the accusation that Dr Ford made was very thinly evidence she couldn't remember most of the details\nThat would be the details necessary to prove something happened and when she named witnesses none of the witnesses including her best friend could remember that it ever even happened in fact her best friend so she never even met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet the doctor for a professor Ford said that her best friend was there when this awful thing was supposed to happen\nThe reason there is so much anger at a Christine Blasey Ford ... Ford is that she made a career and frankly person destroying accusation and did it with nothing but she did it with nothing to back it up\nRight but I\nDon't hold hold on joy joy I've got to push back

with the police Texas is doing it they put into law a requirement that says any student entering the ninth grade this year this academic year or thereafter has to take part in a class and watch a video on how to interact properly with officers during traffic stops\nIt's kind of amazing that we've reached that point in America where parents some parents apparently are doing such a poor job of

at talk journalism and\n... that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com you know I remember it wasn't that many years ago that a president named Obama was telling Americans word peak oil we're going to be running out of oil so we have to get away from oil\nJust as fast as we possibly can and then of course we've seen the energy revolution over about the last decade or so in which America is gone from\nA big importer and heavily dependent on\nForeign sources of oil to not only self sufficient but literally enough energy in oil and natural gas that we can literally export a lot of it and that we have abundant supply and we don't have to be beholden to foreign shakes or Venezuela or\nNasty people like that so what we still have politicians who are trying to push us out from away away from oil\nUm build the bonds you a mayor of New York is calling on cities to give up their investments and the oil industry and I thought I talked to Dan kiss you about that who senior vice president at the policy foreign policy at the Institute for energy research Dan welcome back\nEither Lars\nSo what do you what's your first blush impression of Mayor Bill de Blasio apparently deciding that his mandate as mayor is not just run the biggest city in the country but also to talk all the other cities out of investing a dime in oil\n[noise] yeah well it seems to be a common thread among the politicians who are are vying for higher office um it it it sounds good to circle number of people out there and it\nIt's virtually signaling the what it really is doing is ultimately hanging off\nEnormous law says that they would otherwise not have a in those pension funds and to the tune for example in New York state of a one point two to one point five trillion dollars over fifty years that asked\nSo what do you what's your first blush impression of Mayor Bill de Blasio apparently deciding that his mandate as mayor is not just run the biggest city in the country but also to talk all the other cities out of investing a dime in oil [noise]\nYeah well it seems to be a common thread among politicians who are are vying for higher office um it it it sounds good to a certain number of people out there and that\nIts virtues signaling the one that really is doing is ultimately handing off\nEnormous law says that they would otherwise not have a in those\nPension funds and a ... to the tune for example in New York state of a one point two to one point five trillion dollars over fifty years that has to be made up by somebody ah in order to pay people's pensions\nAnd you know that's going to be ultimately the taxpayers\nWell and and so if I understand correctly he would like all the big cities who have massive pension\nFunds that have to earn money until the people who are going to get the pensions get paid and that when if they were to back out of oil stocks I assume they'd put the money into some other kind of dogs and the oil stocks would be sold to willing buyers who would happily buy them so it won't make any difference to the oil companies will still have plenty of people who can buy them\nBut New York will have given given up on the returns they would have had from the ... you know ... the business of fossil fuels which is still a business that are very much supplies the energy for America so what's what's his thinking I mean do you have any idea what why he wants to do this\nWell it's all part of trying to show that\nYou're virtuous and care about climate change Lars this is all about climate change a as all energy issues tend to be now um and what they're what they're trying to say is that by taking the money out of a those\nReturns are those cells\nThey'll simply be taking money away from these companies and they won't have the money and therefore they want drill wells or something um you know that to be nonsense because the fact of the matter is when you compare portfolios with energy stocks of all kinds in them versus ones without a the energy\nOr sons perform better\nAnd have perform better of over fifty years so [noise]\n... basically what you're [laughter] you're cutting off your nose to spite their face ill in some respects\nI mean aren't because the only way for a city to pull money out we talk about it like it's pulling out a drawer but the only way to pull out of a stock is to sell it to somebody else so you'll have willing buyers who will buy those stocks\nWill when the willing buyers by them the oil company as an out anything they still have investors who own their stocks in fact I guess they if the city of New York wants to have a\nFire sale and sell their their all their socks and if they announced they're going to do this I assume some of the buyers are going to say great they're going to give us a sweet deal\nThey'll end up they may have the I guess they could even take stock they bought for a given an amount of money and end up selling it to people for less money than they paid for it that's potentially possible but the ... the stock will still be owned by somebody\nBut as you say their stock portfolio they can't replace that stock with the stock that performs as well as the oil stock does so they'll have to take a loss or their pension fund recipients the police officers and the\nOther civil service workers of New York are they aware of what the city is about to do to them\nWell luckily they have someone in in New York state or the controller who who is in charge of the Senate\nWho own their stocks in fact I guess they if the city of New York wants to have a fire\nSale and sell their their all their socks and did they announce they're going to do this I assume some of the buyers are going to say great they're going to give us a sweet deal\nThey'll end up they may have the I guess they could even take stock they bought for a given an amount of money and ended up selling it to people for less money than they paid for

stock does so they'll have to take a loss or their pension fund recipients the police officers and the\nOther civil service workers in New York are they aware of what the city is about to do to them\nWell luckily they have someone in in New York state or the controller who who is in charge of a sudden he has something called a fiduciary responsibility which uh\nAnyone who manages money tends to have and you're supposed to watch out for those interests to make sure that you don't make bad investments that take away from the value of those people who own shares in it and those were the firemen and policemen and civil servants of all time and um\nAnd he's objecting strenuously to this for the very reasons you and I are discussing because he knows the\nThe record and can show that and can show in a norm is lost to the city under the state because it's it's not just a mayor de Blasio also Governor Cuomo ...\nCan they even legally divest themselves of the stocks of the controller says no this would cause a loss can heat prevent them from doing\nIt varies from state to state and it gets a little dicey because you're dealing with these public funds which don't have a say in some of the same requirements are obviously because so many of them are underfunded Lars I mean we hear all the time about the states that have massive\nPension obligations that can't afford them Illinois and New York California um and\nAnd so there's a little more leeway in that situation but the for the person in charge are they still attempt to live up to the fiduciary responsibility so uh it's not as ironclad as if you were dealing with a a U.S chartered bank or something like that\nAnd well it would be interesting to see what they do because I I I just I I think it's highly irresponsible for them to do this and the other thing is New York city itself can't run without fossil fuels candidate they can't run on diesel gasoline and natural gas\nOr no it would have a very very hard time and the north east is getting increasingly\nIn bad shape as a consequence of bad decisions that won't allow pipelines rebuilt and that sort of thing so we'll see what the winter holds but ah last winter they barely escaped death and uh it's it's probably gotten worse ah and if we get a cold winter will\nWill be able to see ... laboratories of democracy Lars\nKnow it'd be interesting I I Know it's it's just fantasy but can you imagine if the big oil companies are said to New York city you want to do that fine you wanna get out of fossil fuels find we will stop delivery\nOf fossil fuels to all your filling stations you know we won't cut off\nThe you know the oil heat that some people still depend on but we are going to stop supplying gasoline and will do it for a week to see how you like being without gasoline and be entirely out of oil can you imagine I mean as much as Manhattan runs on mass transit they also run on Hoover and cabs and diesel powered buses and the like\nCan you amend jets and yachts can you imagine where they'd be if\nFossil fuel a liquid fuel deliveries stop\nUh it's it's probably gotten worse ah and if we get a cold winter will will be able to see ... laboratories of democracy Lars\nYou know it'd be interesting uh I I Know it's it's just fantasy but can you imagine if the big oil companies are said to New York city you want to do that fine you want to get out of foster feels fine we will stop delivery\nOf fossil fuels to all your filling stations you know we won't cut off\nThe you know the oil heat that some people still depend on what we're going to stop supplying gasoline and will do it for a week to see how you like being without gasoline and be entirely out of oil can you imagine\nI mean as much as Manhattan runs on mass transit they also run on over and cabs and diesel powered buses and the like can you imagine ingest can you imagine where they'd be\nFossil fuel a liquid fuel deliveries stopped to say filling stations and the and the local airport\n[noise] ah that would be one of those what did President Obama is to always tell us that it's a a ...\nCouple foreman or [laughter] something like that teachable moment teachable moment and just say you want to try it well I'll tell you what will just slow it\nDown and we'll cut our deliveries to half\n[laughter] if you work on a farm you know very early in life and that that we need to get young people look let me give you another example\nWe've got something like twenty million people in college today right like they'd be working while they're in school they get Twenty one twenty two year work when I was actually probably wouldn't have a well you know that that student debt crisis if these kids work while they were in school to pay for their education that was that so unreasonable\nNo and especially Steve I remembered nominally I work all the way through the year and a half or is the school that I did and then I took part time class after that but I knew people who in the summertime said they'd go and do the hard dirty jobs in the summertime and they'd rack up three or four thousand dollars\nIn the summertime because they live at home with mom and dad works some dirty job make a bunch of money put it in the bank and they'd have half their half their tuition paid by the time they got back to school and they didn't have to borrow it\nAnd by the way it allows those kinds of people 'cause I remember when I was in college my junior year I live with four guys in the house to model and financial aid and the other two were working\nWhich to do you think got a better uh you know get more out of their education you know ... and Steve I Can't say I actually had to work so they actually knew the value of the education if you get something way to people for free they're not going to value it right I mean so I think that would be an area we can get a lot more workers we need to get the skills\nTook part time class after that but\nI knew people who in the summertime said they'd go and do the hard dirty jobs in the summertime and they'd rack up three or four thousand dollars\nIn the summertime because they live at home with mom and dad works some dirty job make a bunch of money put it in the bank and they'd have half their half their tuition paid by the time they got back to school and they didn't have to borrow it\nAnd by the way ... those kinda people 'cause I remember when I was in college my junior year I live with four guys in the house to model and financial aid and the other two were working which to do you think got a better uh you know get more out of their education\nYou know ... and Steve\nI Can't say I actually had to work so they actually knew the value of the education if you give something way to people for free they're not going to value it right I mean so I think that would be an area we can get a lot more workers we need to get the skills for the workers but you know what the employers will give these workers the skills\nThey will train them out of the job they will train them how to use a forklift or how to drive a truck or a you know be a welder or you know all these just by the way it ... you know what's truck drivers are earning twenty thousand dollars oh\nLet me tell you I ran into a couple of guys who'd come to a station event the listener event and I was younger guy and they just were\nFriends and I said uh what do you do to the older guy and he said I run an electrical contracting business I said you know I tried to talk my step son into that\nI said I I Know there were both union and non union training programs where they would hire you and the rate two years ago was fourteen fifty an hour so it's like twenty nine thousand a year and every six months if you stayed in a program where you went to a class\nFour hours a night for one night a week so it wasn't you know it wasn't asking you to go sixteen hours a day all week long\nThat at the end the tuition for was eighty bucks a month and it was an official state approved process where you at the end of four years you had eight thousand on the job training hours working at others and then and then you had six or seven hundred hours\nIn a classroom and every if you stayed in the program you started a fourteen fifty every six months your paycheck went up by a buck fifty\nAn hour three thousand bucks a year now and then by the time you've finished you were thirty five dollars an hour Seventy grand a year that you could salary while I said to this guy said so that's where you're hired your journey man he says Mars we can't get journeyman for\nThirty five bucks an hour he said we're paying forty two dollars an hour yeah Steve that's Ninety thousand dollars a year to start as a journeyman electrician\nAnd you know what this is a shame of that story is meanwhile we spent two hundred thousand dollars and you know at cost to the taxpayer to put these kids through college and half of them are walking out with a sociology degree or ethnic studies degree or political\nScience degree I guess what they're not jobs for political science degree or a sociology degree you've got to be able to do something you know and this was a failure\nEducation system virus we're not preparing\nYou know these kids the twenty first century for the twenty first century cats when I was in high school I don't know if you had this we had shop class so we do a number that we did have had any market hey you know what they have their touchy feely classes now\n[laughter] it's just it's the education system is not a parent we spent\nTwo trillion dollars a year on our education system\nHours but we're not preparing the kids for the job so they can compete with the Chinese and the Indians and Europeans and it's one of the biggest failings of this country we've\nGot a ... you know we've got to turn that around because there are there are probably ten million Americans of working age that could be working and should be working but um even people with disabilities and it just because your dad back or something like that doesn't mean you can't work on the assembly line but she could be it over a driver or\nYou know work as a clerk I mean we need we need all hands\nNot preparing you know these kids the twenty first century for the twenty first century jobs when I was in high school I don't know if you have this we had shop class so we did we did the market you know what they have their touchy feely classes now\nIt's just it's the education system is not a parent we spend\n... billion dollars a year our education system\nHours but we're not preparing the kids for the job so they can compete with the Chinese and the Indians and Europeans and it's one of the biggest failings of this country we've\nGot to ... you know we've got to turn that around because there are there are probably ten million Americans of working age that could be working and should be working but um even people with disabilities and it just because your dad back or something like that doesn't mean you can't work on the assembly line but you could be at overdrive oh well\nYou know work as a clerk I mean ever we need we need all hands on deck right now and then they'd everybody working I've got I've got a suggestion\nSteve and that is than in all these communities that got rid of the shop class and maybe even got rid of all the physical facilities\nWhat would happen if they went to some of the industries in their area and said hey we want to teach kids how to do shop but we need we need to ... we'll give you the space in one of our buildings but what we need is we need some ... some planners and some ... and all this stuff for my shop classes\nAnd and we're going to teach these kids how

who was a previous Facebook employee who were just left the company and at first I thought this was a good thing he he denounced\nOr their censorship of everything but then proceeded to explain that it's um\nIt's not coming from the top of Facebook bosses but it's like dissemination I'm from Rhode lackeys I guess within Facebook as though they're able to get around what ... ...\nUm and maybe that's true but to me it sounded more like a deflection of responsibility and even just another example where the lack of creativity from the left\nSo I didn't see the report but that's actually true we knew that the big jak guys want to censor but that the leftist they've hired remember like six months ago when I got banned off you do for a while and then they said oh he was put back thousands concerns were banned it was ... groups that didn't understand that were poorly trained no they hired\nTwenty thousand Southern Poverty Law Center trade ashtray dabba ...\nAnd just ship them in there and a government contract that Obama set up two years ago which still operating with billions of dollars and so yes it's partially ruined Bob and below and then the executives deny they know what's going on but but but really they knew what they were doing what you see the plausible deniability\nWhat like a bird on 'em and maybe that's true but\nTo me it sounded more like a deflection of

but still operating with billions of dollars and so yes it's pressure on Bob and below and then the executives denied I Know it's going on but but but really they knew what they were doing but you see the plausible deniability but I just brought in the army of sensors\nYes and and all that to say that you know you're banned from these platforms um and so it's a war and and you know I feel like you need to use your platform and where and your influence right now to start denouncing these companies\nUm you know every year everybody that's listening to you have the planet in their in them that they need to like separate from the east\nLike through the shirt we're going to try to build a more high tech you know basic message board and posting system for everybody very very soon we're going to try to do it all I'm just not one of these big billion dollar companies but but I mean I'm saying they should be rude anti trusted\nI've written reports in that law firm ... reports the president starting six months ago that's why I was shut down I've been behind the scenes and on air you may have just tuned in for the first time that we've been leading the charge against us with Matt

Congressman Joe Walsh back with you this Wednesday follow\nMe on Twitter at Walsh freedom were twenty days away again twenty days away from\nA really important mid term election I wanted to get kind of a view on what's going on out there especially with some of these Senate races happy to be joined by Alexandra dissing this she's with a National Review 'em\nA publication that everybody should check out every day Alexandria thank you for joining me uh let me start broad work twenty days out right now I'm it appears that when it comes to the United States Senate there's momentum for Republicans yeah\nI think that's exactly right read on where we are and that was always the case I mean looking at the map here it was always favorable at the Republican given are so many democratic incumbents ... that Donald Trump won and twenty sixteen but I think you know even the momentum now as clearly as favoring Republicans perhaps even more overtime\nI'm intrigued Alexandra by a ... a couple of races I saw a debate a couple of nights ago in Arizona a mix Sally against cinema um gimme gimme your thoughts on this race it appears to still be neck in neck\nI think so I and we haven't ... if it's probably died in there hasn't been a new poll in the last couple of days but I'm awaiting very early a three foot tall and that rate over the last couple of days in particular it's really interesting stories that come out about access cinematic Democrat\nIn the race and she apparently has passed or being intensely oppose the Iraq War protesting our troops out you know ... very strange kind of even attacking her state thing that people in our town they're crazy and I I really can't imagine that comments like that are are going to have at least some kind of negative effect on her campaign\nAre you surprised a that cinema is doing as well as she's doing in Arizona and and the only reason I ask is I Know Martha mix Sally and she's a strong military she's got a really strong record\nI guess I'm surprised at that race is close\nYou know I I started was as well but you have to think about you know the facts\nCouple of days but I'm awaiting very early uh the most recent poll in that race to get over the last couple of days in particular some really interesting stories have come out about ... and cinnamon who's the Democrat\nIn the race um and she's you know apparently has passed or being intensely opposed the Iraq War protesting our troops out you know down the list of just very strange kind of even attacking her own state thing that people in Arizona are crazy and I I really can't imagine that comments like that are aren't going to have at least some kind of negative effect on her campaign\nAre you surprised a that cinema he's doing as well as she's doing in Arizona and and the only reason I ask 'cause I Know Martha ... she's a strong military just got really strong record\nI I guess I'm surprised that race is close\nYou know I I started was as well but you have to think about you know the fact that Jeff Flake is a current incumbent and is retiring at least in part a presumably because a certain ... certain type of Republicanism resonating an estate anymore for some reason I think a big part of that it's\nChanging demographics that you know on the state was pretty close and twenty sixteen is not your standard a Republican voter there and so I think I'm\nPerhaps than him I was able to sort of capture the messaging with more of a an Arizona style and you come across as left progressive than she actually is an appeal to people\nNow we're a last question Arizona I Know that Trump is coming in I think before the weeks out how does Trump play in a state like that\nI think that's actually a tough question I'm a I'm a little bit surprised to

nineteenth avenue gamble back uh born in St Joe says I'm bilingual speaking Spanish or ... that doesn't make me necessarily a good doctor what makes me to the doctor is going back to purpose actually trying to help people\nYou put them in a retainer\nFor about twelve to Eighteen months after that correct he said yes I did is the reason that you do that\nIs to put the memory and trying to make it permanent for the correction of the team so they don't go back into the brain he said yes\nI said thank you I'm now going to be helping more people permanently and that is the law of the body it's not Dr frost opinion it's a neurological law was what you are governed and I want you to remember something when they put a retainer in what's the root word retain\nAnd they do that on purpose it's an intentional act to get you a better longer correction and that's what we do in our clinic that's what we've done with Travis and you've heard Travis\nTravis didn't tell you whether I was trying to get out of him but he didn't tell you what's the other day when we were talking to the other guys were asking what's up with you how come you're not taking your medication why don't you hurting and of course he was telling his story to them and that's what I Want you also remember you don't have to hurt this guy is challenging in his body to me like an M M A fighter\nYou know he's pounding it out there and he's carrying you know thirty forty fifty pounds of you know in a backpack in an armored\nSo please you know you don't have to be that guy like ... you can just be that person who wants to walk better play golf you want to play tennis he told you is coming back to do his shoulder why would somebody travel all the way from tendencies to come see me when he could go to anybody\nIt's a relationship gets trust and as result why because I told you the definition of purpose and my purpose was to help him the best that I could and I'm very thankful that God was able to help them heal his body with the natural way of using embryonic tissues cells to rebuild him while bio mechanically correcting has problem I'm\nTo hurting and of course he was telling his story to them and that's what I Want you also remember you don't have to hurt this guy is challenging in his body to me like an M M A fighter you know he's pounding it out there and he's carrying you know thirty forty fifty pounds of you know in a backpack in an armored\nSo please you know you don't have to be that guy like drivers you can just be that person who wants to walk better play golf you want to play tennis he

I told you the definition of purpose mhm and my purpose was to help him the best that I could and I'm very thankful that God was able to help him he'll his body\nWith the natural way of using embryonic tissues cells to rebuild him while bio mechanically correcting has problem I'm so thankful and passion to be a part of that world and help people like Travis our military get back out there helping us and then join his life\n[noise] and I took a nasty it's I actually had a few people coming in the story this week with addicts pain [laughter] yeah it's a very calm and so so what what would you say to them like what would you take take me through that process as of like how you can help them\nWell first of all I Would passionately say that it's so awful yes because I have suffered from that yes All right um so\nThat it comes from the nerve roots in the low back region and it's an comes from about five different routes five different vertebrate where the vertebrate excuse me the ... the rules are all come together\nAnd they create one big nerve and they call it the ... addict nerves now any one of those nerves on either side of the spine at any level and have nerve interference on it and cause this phenomenon called ridiculous apathy\nNobody knows why it happens it just does it can even get a part of your leg and go down into your toes and you're like why does it my whole leg or how come my little toes are going down but not my big one well that's the L for nerve route they'll five is the big toe and then we can get into the other anatomy butts\nRegenerative medicine and what I Do think it's absolutely amazing when we when we take what I've done for so many years and now in the last two years we've had regenerative medicine to help to repair the ... and the cartilage of the joints that are supposed to be gliding smoothly\nAnd and function in the way they are designed versus kind of reading against each other and can rebuild and regenerate re lubricate that area for nice lose colliding motion and what I noticed with people who have\nA I had a gun is if we just stem cells and it's only about thirty percent effective but one in ... when they come in and they go through and Levi only chemical you start changing the body\nAnd we start re hydrate in that just naturally which they're special equipment that I used as Patton did they do this I don't own it I've another gentleman Dr Pettit bond designed it but I've been using it for ten years and we've been getting people better for the last eight years with this stuff but when we put\nThe regenerative medicine in there that blows my mind how quickly they get better MCI joins like Travis I only adjusted in twice\nWow and I can tell you that most of the time when I'm working with downside joints than we do I am the Arctic issue in regenerative medicine in the joints and we do the ...\nUm and we get 'em you know back to basically normal in about six weeks\nThat normally about you know a week or two into it I don't even have to adjust the U.S I joined anymore hardly at all it just naturally starts moving properly and freely and what happens when we start using this process the data from the lower back actually can start to diminish as well but only with bio mechanical correction now\nPat upon designed it but I've been using it for ten years and we've been getting people better for the last eight years with this stuff but when we put the regenerative medicine in there it blows my mind how quickly they get better MCI joins like Travis I only adjusted in twice\nWow and I can tell you that most of the time when I'm working with downside joins than we do I am the Arctic issue in regenerative medicine in the joints and we do the ...\nUm and we get them you know back to basically normal and about six weeks\nThat normally about a week or two into it I don't even have to adjust the U.S I joined anymore hardly at all it just naturally starts moving properly and freely and what happens when we start using this process\nThe data from the lower back actually can start to diminished as well but only with bio mechanical correction now ... you have such\nAn open ended loaded question I can go on and on and on I I I Love talking about this stuff you could have picked anything\nUm and uh the\nMost important thing I Want people to understand is\nThat I have not found that themselves alone will get rid of ... hardly at all maybe thirty percent like I said it's actually taken decompression and ... on a table special table for water and nutrients and\nAnd the special wobble chair that re hydrate sit there and adjusting that we actually started getting the correction we're slowly over time that ... starts to diminish and it starts to get functioning better so that you can get through your day hopefully without paying\n... we just had a call from one of our listeners and another tough question here for A L she's talking about me oh you got a lot of knee pain but they are how things go so it's not and\nI always there so we ... you know I Know you have to see here and all of that which I Want to remind everybody you've got another seminar coming up you know It's Tuesday I've\nHad a thirty yeah so oh and and there's this young lady wants to come in a U.S has got to do is called that there are two nine nine to ... to six five six six zero to nine nine to\nTwo to five six she can actually get a complementary visit with me where I ate all do a consultation find out what their goals are doing exam on that area and at least let her know if I can help or not if I Can't we'll find somebody who can but it's an interest to have a great story of sole reason if you look down at my left me I have this thing on\nHere yes fly on I've done that let's say you can jump I don't think yeah\nI Know who I'm looking forward to it's going to have\nTo be modeled um [laughter] so you know this is a really good question and because it comes and goes to remember when you're sixty percent dysfunction of a nerve that's when you're going to get the Simpson when it goes below that you're not going to get the symptoms but it doesn't mean the problem is not there are some of the day on my story I was looking forward to today\nAnd I know we don't have much time for six years ago I was in Tennessee and I was mountain\nI was not and biking by myself and it's a ten mile ride and if the remote areas so what I ended up doing was\nCrashing like three to four miles in\nAnd I thought I broke my leg and I didn't and I looked at and like oh it's just a humorous Houma yeah I Know that's the fancy word for like a blood bluster right but it was really big on the inside of my leg just above my knee and my muscular trip but my ... my my leg good function it didn't hurt it just it was kind of like an abrasion\nAnd I thought well what do I do go back or move forward well of course I rode the six to eight miles out in the set by the time I\nWas done I was black and blue all the way from the top of my leg down to a bottom of my calf I'm like I was really dumb and yet doctors do dumb things and so anyway for the last six years I just noticed that you know I have this sort of thing here and I had some lumps in there and I tried to get it out with some ultrasound do conservative things\nThe remote areas so what I ended up doing was crashing like three to four miles in\nAnd I thought I broke my leg and I didn't and I looked at and like oh it's just a huge Houma yeah I Know the the fancy word for like a blood bluster right but it was really big on the inside of my leg just above my knee and my muscular but my ... my my leg good function it didn't hurt it just it was kind of like an abrasion\nAnd I thought well what do I do go back or move forward well of course I rode the six to eight miles out in the set by the time I was done I was black and blue all the way from the top of my leg down to a bottom of my child I was really dumb and yup doctors do dumb things [laughter] so\nAnyway for the last six years I just noticed that you know I had this sort of in here and I have some lumps in there and I tried to get it out with some ultrasound do conservative things and I never really bothered me about two months ago my knee started bothering me I've never injured my knees and in my life I've been into martial arts and wrestling and running and everything\nAbout two weeks ago I could hardly step up on a step on so I came in at when it came and went and I noticed it you know here and there and I was like the typical person like maybe this young lady here and I\nWell I can get through life it's OK I'll just continue the strengths and I go to the gym you ignore it no I don't either knowledge that I disagree with you on that one but I knowledge did but I didn't go to somebody\nThat I should have and have proper extra so I had an MRI done last Thursday okay found out I had three torn muscles on the inside of my leg hopefully on the inside when it's because we're starting to fray Mm I think that was because for six years my muscular Cher was out of balance and started wearing on my next guests mhm so I'm not going to make you gifts or what I did and the next hour\nBut [laughter] I called surge addicts up and I said I Need to see these ... and that afternoon Dr Miller actually be happened to be in the clinic doing injections with themselves and I had an injected then I put this knee brace on an oh my gosh to unload the inside of the knee\nTo unload the inside of the ... with the proper biomechanics and getting things taken care of correctly makes all the difference in the world so I Am a recipient for those that have knee problems\nPlays color called six zero to nine nine to two six five six come shake my hand in my clinic let me see what I can do to help you and let's get you fix stopped suffering yeah get your life back it's not necessary\nAnd I want to remind everybody again for the free workshop that Dr phil Ross has coming up October twenty third next Tuesday at six thirty it's a again a free event you just come in and asked\nThe doctor some great question and that is that one six six zero north fortieth street a sweet cheap too and I was that your clinic so it wasn't that far away you\nKnow are we in my clinic how much how fast and then the next time that you're like in thirty seconds to say and also go to a zero Janet region med dot com saves the region\nNext year in thirty seconds and also do the easy Rachel we can come said\nMimicking disrupt our natural hormone production and so that's why we see with a lot of women especially in my clinical practice we see a lot of younger women with menstrual problems are much lower regularity youth\nUm or really really bad um hormonal acne or migraines so a lot of hormonal I'm imbalances that are happening and what the Astros and does is it helps the body manage a lot of these um hormones disruptor that were\nBeing exposed to 'em and it helps your body protests them a lot better\nTo help bring your hormones back into balance\nAnd um I I think that you know it's definitely an important thing to be doing\nFor um for women of all ages and I think if we can what I'm trying to do my practice is trying to educate the younger women especially you know when I see younger women coming in and they you know they have their hair died every six weeks and they get you know they're ...\nNails done then you know eyelash extensions are really big right now I'm so if you think about how many chemicals just in that you know women are exposing themselves on top of\nYou know makeup and body lotion and you know shampoos and ... and all those chemicals that works posing ourselves to so a lot of it is education on avoidance\nYou know and going to their local health food stores and trying to buy 'em you know natural I deodorant or natural makeup and there's some really really amazing lives that are out there now\nThere are um yeah I Know I have a lot of people that come in and some people do what is this estrogen dominance thing you know yeah you're talking a lot of us out here so [noise] yeah yeah and he's been with him so\nHe had even with hormone testing like I Do a lot of hormone testing in my practice and I often see\nThat estrogen dominance picture like too much estrogen versus projects drone um and so as I mentioned it can lead to a lot of those\nYou know most common women's health conditions that you know you're probably seeing in your store you know women that are coming in and they're like Harris thinning or they have like really really bad PMS or they you know have headaches every month and so they won't hormones are out of balance\nUm but they're not quite sure what to do about it [noise]\nMhm so which products would you recommend for a sin somebody in their mid fifties who um are kind of going through a mental pause but yet still have their cycle every month\nAnd yeah and he's been\nWith him so he had even with hormone testing like I Do a lot of hormone testing in my practice and I often see\nThat estrogen dominance picture like too much estrogen versus protest around um and so as I mentioned it can lead to a lot of those\nYou know most common women's health conditions that you know you're probably seeing in your store you know women that are coming in and they're like hairs thinning or they have like really really bad PMS or they you know have headaches every month and so they won't hormones are out of balance\nUm but they're not quite sure what to do about it [noise]\nMhm so which products would you recommend for a say somebody in their mid fifties who um are tired of going through a mental pause but yet still have their cycle every month which products because you know right now there\nAre again it's so it's a dream it'll be a it's a can't sleep they're moody um they don't know what's going on with their bodies right now so what would you recommend a which products or would you recommend\nYeah so that's that's a really um that's a tough days because a lot of times those women\nAnd also I have to be mindful of you know I don't want to I don't want to recommend you know for patients due to leave and say okay here I'm going to get you know like Fifteen pill that you need manager Perry ... and so\nOn one first and foremost I I always recommend the astro sense because I think that will really help to bring that as a protest drawback to balance and I think his theory\nIs is women always think oh I'm going very menopause\nAll my hormones must be like plummeting but that's not always the case a lot of women that are in that area matter puzzle face off in our estrogen dominant because their protest on levels have been declining\n... for a long time prior to protest wrong usually start declining when we're in our thirties and then you already started getting that estrogen dominance back then and then when we hit ... it's much more dramatic usually when women hitting ... usually that's in their fifth\nLike late forties or fifties that's when estrogen eventually dropped off but that there's that whole preliminary start where there's actually that asked you to nominate is happening so I usually will recommend the Astros then and then um we haven't talked to lie about their journals yet but I\nThink a supporting Israel function is absolutely important to you in that prevent appalled will face to help prepare the body for 'em and applies\nThe adrenal have a huge contributing factor to helping the hormones stay healthy um especially that balance between estrogen and protests around help with sleep help with energy\nHelp with um the will help your serotonin production and help with cravings so that adrenal I'm a a adrenal support is really important as well\nAs a doctor um how do you identify adrenal fatigue\n[noise] yeah so there's a couple of different ways you can you can do 'em do that one was in the ... the advantage to that I had worked in a clinical practice is that you know I'm spending an hour to an hour and a half with some of the ... and doing was held in ...\nBut I Know I'm working I'm In my health food stores have have you only get a small I'm a small amount of time to chit chat with with your customers and so usually I I'm I look at like obvious signs and symptoms of adrenal fatigue um and one thing that and I'm pretty sure you probably have\nOne or two of my books but you know there's the adrenal stress connection books that I co op\nA a adrenal support is really important as well\nAs a doctor um how do you identify adrenal fatigue\n[noise] yeah so there's a couple of different ways you can you can do 'em do that one was in the ... the advantage of that I had worked in a clinical practice is that you know I'm spending an hour to an hour and a half with some of the ... and doing held in because of her\nBut I Know I'm working I'm In my health food store ... ... you only get a small I'm a small amount of time to chit chat with with your customers and so usually I I'm I look at like obvious signs and symptoms of adrenal fatigue um and one thing that I'm pretty sure you probably have\nOne or two of my books but you know there's the adrenal stress connection books that I co authored with Dr Karen Jensen a few years back and then I have my making sense a women's health book which is the purple book\nAnd so in those books there's actually a little questionnaires on\nYou know rate your adrenal Strasser adrenal fatigue and I find that those are great um [noise]\nUh resources for your customers and I always find that it's a great resource for my patients as well and I often you know\nSend them home with the questionnaire and I'll say you know fill this out bring it back on the very next deployment so that's probably the easiest way you know there are other fertile has that you can have done there's cortisol testing that you can have done through saliva testing um that's specifically\nLabs\nI'm so that when I got another test there and testing that you can have done to you but I think probably the easiest way for us to merge and people coming into the whole I Would be kind of look and watch the ... and ... and looking at the um the questionnaire\nGreat in and where can they find this questionnaire is it only in your book or can we find it on your Web site\nThat's a good question I just really did my whole website so I don't know if it's still on there\nUm but I'll make a note to my Web designer that we should do a little blurb about having the questionnaire on there again um but the books for sure and um yeah so I'll I'll add that to on my list of things to do that to my website\nAs well [laughter] that's another thing women like to do is that this to do [laughter] yeah\nI can look under and longer so I'm I wanted to talk a little bit too um\n... which is you're right you know here on the floor it healthy habit we just have like five minutes to just assess really quick of what's going on you know and if it is hormones or if it is a sigh Roy 'cause I Know right now\nEverybody's on high road medication and everybody's complaining to their doctors about you know hair falling now lack of sleep just what's going on and I'm just seen over and over you know what do you have for ... and I have to ask them you know\nThe question again and to make sure that really side right but as you were saying to with the hormones I mean it's cortisol it's adrenal it's your thyroid if one is off its pulling from the other to correct what would you recommend\nThat you know absolutely nothing wrong connection between low adrenal chronic stress affecting how the fire is going to her\nPerform at home mom with normal\nPace if somebody's coming in already ... with a preexisting low thyroid so that that medication for you know ten plus years\n... and there aren't taking any adrenal support that one of the first ... ... you know the woman says okay nine times out of ten there is a call goes oh no I'm picture that I'm lying\nCy rights but as you were saying to with the hormones I mean it's cortisol it's adrenal it's your side writes this one is off its pulling from the other to correct what would you recommend that you\nKnow absolutely nothing wrong connection between lower adrenal chronic stress affecting how the fire is going to perform\nPerform and so the ... case\nIf somebody is coming in already ... with a preexisting low thyroid so they've been on medication for you know ten plus years\nI'm ... and they're not taking any adrenal support that's one of the first inning are all you know the woman says okay nine times out of ten there is a code was all snow um picture that I'm lying for finals this one from\nA town of my customers students that triangle right is that what you're yeah they yeah OK yeah absolutely\nAnd civil that would be um I don't know if we mentioned adrenal sense but that would be you know looking at the adrenal sense formula that you know it's been sort of a ... day adrenal formula in my practice for years and then\nIf they're like um [noise] the the follow up a little bit of extra help because sometimes you can you can provide support and the thyroid will just fall back on its owner will just start functioning a lot better\nSometimes people being a little a little extra thyroid support as well especially if they say hey you know what I've been taking Israel or for years and my I still feel like my ... a little bit off\nThen um you have the final sense formula\nWhich is essentially provides the body with all of the co factors I'm forest fibroid hormone production so we've got you know I ... and ... which is a really nice out of ...

I don't know if we can do anything with that\nOh hey are you back\nYou're saying welcome Dan and Dan's on here\nJust go because if you don't any weight weight then you're going to be story if you're paying a quarter percent higher or if you have to be a discount point meaning let's say if you wanted to get\nToday's rate and the rate had gone up a quarter an eight in the you're on a two hundred and eighty thousand if a ... a point would be an additional uh two thousand seven hundred and forty two dollars that maybe if you like when you wouldn't have to pay\nRight you're talking about towards towards costs to get along at all on the other on the other side of that this was kind of talking about in the open we're seeing a little more softness in general in the market\nMight be a chance to hopefully negotiate from closing costs credit with the seller maybe a little bit of a discount on price it's more of a fifty fifty market\nSo you have that on the other side\nI Do I'm seeing more and more Delhi's agreed to pay costs and more and more lifting agents preparing the salaries that you're probably going to have to pay some cause if you want to sell your property because unless you've got a real hot property aggressively price may be a different story\nSure and you find that out in the first couple of weeks you lift your property first week\nYou'll see you'll see right off the bat what the what the activity level is and you're like whoa I enterprise it than overpriced it you know a lot of times when people get the pricing of the properties and they get five offers to thinking oh my God I under price of my house not necessarily\nOur own little stable listings we've we've certainly seen some reductions and it's it's generating activity so it's just a symptom of the ebb and flow of markers\nWhat would you think about the psyche of the buyer right now then would you would you say that the buyer is more apt to want to rush in in lock in by property or would you say that\nUh they're sitting on the sidelines waiting um is it knocking a lot of people out of a of properties that they were thinking about wanting to buy and now they have to find a little bit less expensive property and they're not finding anything appealing what is your what is your take\nI'm planning that people are getting out there trying to secure property because they're afraid rates are going to grow up because the feds they're saying they're going to raise them again so [noise]\nYes and make sure that if you are pre qualified somewhere that you check with your loan officer and find out where rates are because that can definitely a deter like if you wanted to go to Rudy\nAnd the rates than a quarter or three eight or a half and she got pre qualified you may want to bring your your thought process down to two sixty because you know what somebody can qualify doesn't necessarily mean that what they want to pay on a monthly basis\nExactly and not only that but if you think about it prices are going to kind of prices in real estate are going to come down a lot slower than rates will go up so if you're looking at two eighty and now you've got to go to to sixty you're not going to be happy probably as to what's up for two sixty and until prices start to come down\nA that's a great point and or the other thing is um what about people that are in New bill situations like right now they they they got into their new build safe three months ago\nAnd the property is getting its got three more months to go and uh they got qualified the very beginning on a rate that was going to be at say five percent or foreign three A's or foreign Seventy four and a half four and a half now why\nDid you did a ... because I Would imagine some of them are real close to qualifying knock qualifying or ... and you know not to mention builders cut builders contracts or non refundable\nSo if you can't qualify at the end because the rates went up you lose Ernest you lose your earn it um in general yeah\nThey're not all that but yeah a desert there's probably a finance contingency some of these things but burns money still actually there is no your answers\nSixty nine until prices start to come down\nA that's a great point and or the other thing is uh what about people that are in New build situations like right now they they they got into their new build safe three months ago\nAnd the property is get it got three more months to go and uh they got qualified the very beginning on a rate that was going to be at say five percent or foreign three eighths of foreign Seventy four and a half four and a half now why\nDid you did a ... because I Would imagine some of them are real close to qualifying knock qualifying uh and and you know not to mention builders cut builders contracts or non refundable\nSo if you can't qualify at the end because the rates went up\nYou lose Ernest you lose your um in general you know not in a maybe they're not all that\nBut yeah a desert there's probably a finance contingency some of these things but burns money still\nActually there is no answers do finance contingency in a new bill you you you put your money up you get qualified within thirty days or Fifteen days and you're you're on your way they're building that house based on your money\nSo ... H ... each contractors different by if you're doing a new building right now get out there find out what the rates are and see what your ah you know see what your variances\n[noise] well and plan for at least an additional point\nWould be my advice to the buyer you know um when I qualify for me though I always qualified at least a half above\n... percent above what the going rate is and I have one right now that it's supposed to close this month it's a small they'll they're it's taking them over six months\nYou know when we first started the process where in the low for and I find that convinced them to like a four point eight seven five he kept thinking that the rates are going to come down and I said I mean they could afford it didn't matter\nBut at the large alone alone or fifty three one their record ever present you know you're looking at eighty Ninety dollars a month for the next Thirty years so he finally locked in\nAnd he kept holding out hope that it was going to go down and now he's very grateful that he not locked him when he did\nWould be looking at five and a quarter I mean a lot of times you're you're dealing with using builders are a lot of times I've incentives like that could be a you know\nAllocated toward you know buying down your rate which which may be an option for some of you out there if you have run into that situation where rape spiked you didn't have enough leeway in your lock what have you uh look at the builder incentives or because you may have to do you have to look at buying down the rate\nUh okay yeah so we have and again if you have any questions about new bill financing or or any of the things we're talking about today in rising her direct line of suburban mortgage six to six six\nSixty seven twenty eight six six six sixty seven twenty eight let's see where are we with rate today do you want to start off ha\nYeah and it's oj good credit\nTwo hundred and eighty thousand cells praised the interest rate though hanging in there they're live five percent than NPR if I point it when to only payment Eighteen forty two thirty\nEighteen forty two now include mortgage insurance taxes insurance all of that each away an allowance\n... yes it's estimated in of course taxes are very all over the valley so you know it's something that you want to watch how about da\nDa da da di di di di ... to Ninety two\nAlright Seventeen twenty three still five percent VA how about a conventional at the end\nAnd then you know twenty percent then good credit where by plane to side with any of your five point three sticks or own fourteen twenty four forty four\nAlright fourteen twenty four the conventional financing based on two two eighty twenty percent down get your payment of fourteen\nOr just stay in it I mean you know some people have some equity in their house they only they don't want to capture the equity um and they they want to wait till prices fluctuate what have you\nIf you think that this market has topped and at your house is that is that they are upper end of its value why not try to sell it now live in it for a year in in ... in the market possibly gifts\nYou know well we actually I was talking to somebody after the show last week who says you know I Need to do a lot of work on my house but I really don't have the capital available to do that\nAnd that might be an option if this this seems to fit that price point in their model they will consider an offer a competitive market offer just give us a call we can get it to you\nFor into four or five one three three one eight four ... four or five one three three one eighty go on Elton brothers dot com and you can sign in an e mail us a your address and we can look it up and get you a competitive market offer on your home\n[noise] so that's something to consider a and so and so's works through two ways we work with a lot of investors obviously and I was just surprised to see Peoria at the top of the\nThe list the biggest regional increase Peoria wow that's like Gilbert was last week and that and by the way this is between September of twenty Seventeen and September twenty Eighteen\n\nTammy Gilbert and to and just to put a button on that\nPiece the uh\nThe average rent in Peoria eleven hundred and fourteen dollars which was a nine point five percent increase over last year or does\nIt say the dwelling on anything having to do that\nDot com you can sign in an e mail us a your address and we can look it up and get you a competitive market offer on your home\n[noise] so that's something to consider a and so and so's works through two ways we work with a lot of investors obviously and I was just surprised to see Peoria at the top of the\nThe list the biggest regional increase Peoria wow that's like Gilbert was last week and that and by the way this is between September twenty Seventeen and September twenty Eighteen\n...

school on a bulletin board they were using it\nYeah we have that today too so amazing let me tell you\nAlso didn't um there was this hill about a on a hill piece about John James he's West Point grad

again\nI mean for crying out loud it was in a school on a bulletin board they were using it as a lesson\nPeople chill the hell out and so now you have all of these idiotic media people who are lecturing him I don't think of us combat that going to need your all lecturing on fighting oppression so maybe just stop for a little bit\nOf we have more on the way we have that coming up we have also the latest with the hand what is that what he does he princesses\nHe is everything that a Democrat Claire McCaskill would fear Josh Hawley he Holly very much support the Trump Administration and he very much is is in line with\nThe immigration with the tax reform with the trade manufacturing et cetera\nBut he is very uh he'd law and order right he's super serious and I almost think that's a negative for him he's just not shrill and over the top he's not he's he's pretty laid back I mean he'll he'll get bought when he needs to but he's just lay back and he wants to get it done\nWhile people are running around waving their arms trying to distract from one identity politics tactic to the next he just gets it done\nAnd that almost kind of goes against him because a lot of people view that\nAs and mistakenly I think there's a lack of charisma and it's not that he doesn't have charisma it's just that he is\nVery serious when I'm not making the comparison either but I'm just saying no one would sit here and be like John Wayne is a charismatic he just says no charisma\nBecause he says periods no one would ever say that just people have different demeanor and that's his demeanor and I seriously doubt that he would have at all a had the time or be had been interested in participating in something like that\nGet real to my knowledge I don't even think he even knows\nJames's crew\nAnd while people are running around waving their arms trying to distract from one identity politics tactic to the next he didn't get that done\nAnd that almost kind of goes against him because a lot of people view that\nAs and mistakenly I think is a lack of charisma and it's not that he doesn't have charisma it's just that he is\nVery serious when I'm not making the comparison either but I'm just saying no one would sit here and be like John Wayne is a charismatic he didn't says no charisma\nBecause he says Syria no one would ever say that just people have different demeanor is and that's his demeanor and I seriously doubt that he would have at all a had the time or be had been interested in participating in something like that\nGet real ... to my knowledge I don't even think he even knows James's crew now there are people in Missouri who do because Missouri back in the day when I Lived there was a the hot that for activism uh but I think that was before a hall even came on the scene\nSo the I I think that was just a she lied that was a lie that she said\nShe lied again\nAnd she desperate to spin that says oh no this isn't so much an issue of me lying to voters about how moderate I Am and my staff telling voters that I'm going to I'm totally onboard with impeaching Trump or if the house and Senate somehow change hands to Democrat\nAnd we're just going to tell those moderate voters that supported me to get over it I mean that was literally the quote from her staff or they have to get over it and her staff or say well she supports should a of a ban on same item attic rifles\nNow McCaskill what's weird when she was talking to that reporter she wasn't than anything that was already not publicly known everyone knows that she ... she supports an assault weapons ban but here's the difference\nShe kinda got caught because when you're talking about an assault weapons ban you and I both know that a lot of people on the left used that as the term to mean all semi automatic rifle but they know that stain or semi automatic rifles will scare the crap out of you\nSo they don't say all of a semi automatic rifles they say a salt weapons\nSo active to suggest that they actually only the poor banning just a couple of kinds of semi automatic rifle but that really it but that's not what it is they're talking about going after I mean if you look and I have them easily pulled out the two thousand and two wells are all the way through two thousand and sixteen FBI uniformed crime reports which was the last\nCollection available and they'll have others coming up I think there's one singular twenty Seventeen report that's been published there is nothing for twenty Eighteen yet\nBut the two thousand and twelve and twenty sixteen report when you look at the breakdown and these are murder victims these are not people who are\nA suicide et cetera uh the vast majority if you're comparing quote unquote assault weapons with I don't know maybe the automobile accidents are hands feet and sets those are two and three times\nA deadlier than just quote unquote assault weapons and that is according to the FBI zone statistic which is easily available on line by Googling for FBI uniformed crime report UCR twenty twelve to twenty sixteen they also have it available in a PDF format\nHe'd like to save and keep it you know just for granting Google\nBut the bottom line is that it's it's not even at ... ... there's so many other things that are way deadlier but that's why they don't want to say that they say assault weapons they don't want to say semi automatic rifles\nBecause then you when you go after some automatic rifles and you're going to go after some automatic handgun and then you're just going to go after whatever else was left and that's the goal is incremental and they want to change the language which is why they made up these terms that when she gets out there and she says that you know before an assault weapons ban okay so semi automatic rifles\nAnd when she won't clarify that\nQuote unquote assault weapons and that's according to the FBI zone statistic which is easily available on line by Googling for FBI uniformed crime report do you see ours twenty twelve to twenty sixteen they also have it available in the PDF format\nHe'd like to save and keep it you know just for grants and go gold\nBut the bottom line is that it's it's not even at it and there's so many other things that are way deadlier but that's why they don't want to say they they say assault weapons they don't want to states them a semi automatic rifles\nBecause then you when you go after some automatic rifles and you're going to go after some automatic handgun and then he's going to go after whatever else is left and that's the goal is incremental and they want to change the language which is why they made up these terms but when she gets out there and she says that you know for an assault weapons ban okay so semi automatic rifles\nAnd when she won't clarify that well what what do you what are you what\nConclusion do you come to win a politician will not publically say no that's not true I don't do that and they're just quite from it and they run and hide from it what conclusion do you usually ... what do you usually think about an issue where a politician act like that which sounds like they're being a little\nDisingenuous sounds like they support it doesn't it yeah yeah I'm trying to make you believe otherwise yeah exactly\nThat's exactly it\nAnd so she knows very well is that how silly it was that she's sitting here accusing Josh Hawley\nIt's just silly\nAnd we've asked her on this program numerous times\nUm I've always been incredibly civil but I'm I'm going to disagree with you and I'm going to question you she looks at that as an act of incivility which is why at one press conference I asked her question and she began screaming at me\nShe was yelling at me in front of all of this media she was yelling at me she falsely accused me of working on her opponent's campaign and all of this stuff I'm like I've never ever worked on a campaign\nEver I have never worked on a campaign\nEver\nI'll support issues never worked on a campaign not since I was in college and it was for a Bill Clinton\nAnd I was just a little lowly volunteer don't hold it against me and said this is a reelection but\nYeah so um that's you know\nIt it was silly for her to say that the the thing is though is the press in Missouri seriously it's always been kind of weird\nBut they've got to\nI think it's media malpractice from Missouri press and I ask her where and and ... because isn't that the whole purpose of media\nI mean you are supposed to\nYou're you're you're supposed to get information and share it with people\nRight I mean she was asked about you know the stuff and it looks like she's really really are trying to hide her her full\nI'm really trying to hide what her positions are for moderate voters not in Missouri debate I think the Senate betas tonight\nSo mhm\nThat ... that Senate debate is uh from what I understand this evening now she is already demanded that there'll be a special prosecutor brought in to investigate the fraud she says\nWhat do you mean fraud\nWhen the hell was fraudulent\nBecause if you want to I mean we let's first defined what the fraud was what was the fraud the frogs seems is I mean when I look at it I see the front of you not being up front with your position senator\nI I see you trying to have it both ways\nHer full I'm really trying to hide what her positions are from moderate voters\n\nNot in Missouri debate I think the Senate betas tonight\nSo mhm\nThat's in ... that Senate debate is ah from what I understand this evening now she is already demanded that there'll be a special prosecutor brought in to investigate the fraud she says\nWhat do you mean fraud when the hell was fraudulent\nBecause if you want to I mean we let's first defined what the fraud was what was the fraud the frog seems\nIs I mean when I look at it I see the front of you not being up front with your position senator\nI I see you trying to have it both ways\n\nAnd a video showing where are you truly stand how has a video showing the truth fraud\nI Would love for that to be defined please just sign that where is that fraud\n[laughter]

passive income because it allows us to live where we want\nAnd invest where we want and we spent the first segment talking about the little bit about Laurie Ann and her history and moving around for jobs and never really being able to be where you want to be because something is dragging you elsewhere in order to make money\nAnd if you can create passive income that that cash flow that it's coming in every month without you working in that business or working very little in that business\nIt gives you tremendous freedom to live wherever in the country you want to live close to the people that you love and the things that you liked to do and invest where it makes sense to invest in Laurie\nWe've been working with a variety of as national uh folks people from across the United states and some from out of the country who are investing all over the United states\nAnd helping them with this concept and we've been doing this for years now we we launch our national program a couple of years ago but it's it's really been\nAbout six or seven years we've been diligently working with people across the country in this process can you tell us a little bit about how it all works and and talk about the national program and how people can actually make this happen in their lives\nSure well you had mentioned in the last segment we don't expect people if they are in a market not conducive for cash flow property\nAnd for investment by an old\nDo and invest where it makes sense to invest in Laurie we've been working with a variety of of national ah folks people from across the United states and some from out of the country who are investing all over the United states\nAnd helping them with this concept and we've been doing this for years now we we launched or national program a couple of years ago but it's it's really been\nAbout six or seven years we've been diligently working with people across the country in this process can you tell us a little bit about how it all works in and talk about the national program and how people can actually make this happen in their lives\n[noise] sure well you had mentioned in the last segment how we don't expect people if they are in a market but it's not conducive for cash flow properties\nAnd for investments by an whole property we don't expect them to give up their life and their job and move away from family pseudo moved to a an area of the country that that that meet the model\nAnd so that's why we teach people that you can do the model in any city that makes sense in any market that makes sense and so we we teach them the price point you've got to do two things in order to invest outside of your market and to analyze whether or not your market is a good one to invest in or not\nSo I'm going to pick on California for instance because their prices they're home prices are out of the ... out of the sky high and they go through the roof they're with their home prices and in order to get a Nineteen fifties or Nineteen sixties little bungalow you could pay half a million dollars for that\nAnd if you read price and went market doesn't support being able to pay for the expenses on a home of you that ah that that cost than it doesn't make sense to actually invested in that area\nThat that that's pretty simple and what would normally do we look at the average eye of the house what it's going to appraised for on the market\nAnd we can generally ballpark look at that and say well rent would probably in order for this to make a good investment property would need to be about one percent of the ... house so if you've got a hundred and Seventy thousand dollar house but you're going to purchase for an acquisition\nBy on hold for cash flow\nYou'd want to consider that you need at least Seventeen hundred dollars a month for rent\nAnd if people in that area aren't paying that amount well then that means that that house too high priced for the model\nSo what we do as we look for areas it's great if it happens in your own backyard because that gives us an advantage or more familiar with the neighborhoods we're familiar with ah which which areas are good and bad so to speak\nBut the thing is is that we can always if it's not in our backyard and if it's in another city or another state for that matter we can always go and look at that particular market and see what the rents are\nAre we can look at rental comp you couldn't even find that if you use search just a normal website like real for dot com or or something like that to be what rental homes or ... or in the area\nAnd then look at what prices at home or selling for and then you can put that one percent rule and see whether or not it makes sense\nSo um do you do your due diligence in the area because if you're not familiar with the area you'd want to look at crime statistics\nYou might want to contact your insurance agent or get an insurance person on your team that that's in the area and see what the insurance rates are going for so you can start calculating what expenses would be a for that property\nTo see how much that would be expenses on that property you're going to come out of the rent check the tenant will be paying the once you apply the same principles to any market you can find a good markets and invested\nSearch just a normal website like real for dot com or or something like that the what rental homes or ... or in the area and then look at what prices at home or selling for and then you can put that one percent will and see whether or not it makes that\nSo um do you do your due diligence in the area because if you're not familiar with the area you'd want to look at crime statistics you might want to contact your insurance agent or get an insurance person on your team that that's in the area\nAnd see what the insurance rates are going for that you can start calculating what benefits would be a for that property\nTo see how much that the expenses on that property you're going to come out of the rent check the attendant will be paying the once you apply the same principle to any market you can find a good markets and investing\nAnd if you can't find um something you know lots of times people get stuck because they want to invest in their own area\nAnd is so many many people are living in areas like you say where the the numbers really don't work out well for rental property which is why many of us live in areas that don't have a lot of renters in the area\nAnd but as they expand out from from where they live they can find many markets usually in a variety of states across the U.S\nWhere it makes sense and maybe there's some on the east coast in the west coast where your numbers are just so high that when you're charging for five thousand dollars a month for rent you're you're into a dynamic in the market that's that's difficult as a landlord it takes you longer find tenants even though people may have higher incomes\nThey also have higher higher expenses and so\nThey they get into a situation where you have the traditional tents taxes\nAnd and toilets where they're really looking at appreciation to maybe talk a little bit about our model and how we look at appreciation of as being the cherry on top instead of the foundation of the investment strategy\nExactly well what we all know that real estate is and appreciating asset so appreciation though is icing on the cake you don't want to go into a a a deal [noise] thinking that it's going to appreciate because that that other speculative nature\nThat we don't want to speculate on anything we want to run good from numbers and I'll tell you as long as there are properties in the price point cute to ah to afford\nTo to make a profit off of rent than appreciation shouldn't shouldn't have come into play that's just simply what you what you get into buying hold so for instance if you work you are if you if you go into a a market and it happened to be\nUm let's say a hundred and under two hundred thousand dollars and you look at that mark and will say well you know prices are going up at a rate of you know what they're really accelerating\nA ... and and so you would want to still not go in for initiation because that's mostly people are just going to speculate on that and then they they run the risk of getting burned you run the numbers the same on every deal no matter which markets\nAnd that's the the fundamentals that allow you to go through the market cycles and I think that's\nPart of what people don't understand about real estate because they've heard the stories about people losing a tremendous amount in real estate during a different bubbles and especially during the the most recent recession which is is fading into history at the moment but I'm causing us to forget\nThat mark off they well I think they are going up at a rate of you know what they're really accelerating or\nAn uncle who would want to still not going for ... that mostly people are just going to speculate on that they they run the risk of getting burned you run the numbers the same on every meal no matter which markets\nAnd that's the the fundamentals that allow you to go through the market cycles and I think that's\nPart of what people don't understand about real estate because they've heard the stories about people losing a tremendous amount in real estate during a different bubbles and especially during the the most recent recession which is is fading into history at the moment but I'm causing us to forget\nThen you also want to establish a a a team of people who can actually funneling find properties or you whether that be a team of of local realtor is in the area it might even be a\nConnecting up with an on line of what some of the real estate investing group leader in the area and you want to be able to put your property\nBut then you can run the numbers on each deal to ... to see if it makes sense but that's not enough just to\nFind the property and do that you've got to be prepared to take action once you do find a good deal because if it's a deal it's going to go pretty quick so you have to make sure that you've got everybody they're happier financing lined up made sure that it's a lender that lens in that area because\nThey're going to want to end and appraiser out to the property to make sure the value these are all checks and balances that we can use to make sure that acquisition it's going to be a good solid sound investment and we're not going to lose money on it\nYou know we look for these property we get our ... and we start being our due diligence as I had mentioned earlier ...\nWe'd want to make sure of the insurance costs on on that particular area a there are there are instances right here in the DFW metroplex where you will do from Dallas County to parents and the insurance rate is hard because parents county happens to have more uh more tornadoes and hail damage\nThan we did in Dallas County that each specific area you're going to want to hone in on those particular\nAspect of the property the once you've got your team you got a lender you're going to need if it's going to be a rehab property you're going to need a good to be a general contractor\nOr maybe you're going to go in with something that's not quite so are the fixed up and yelled at all you need a handyman you'll need to check out for things that are common in that area and these are all done by people for the two\nYou can see if it's common for foundation problems in that area that might be someone that you want on your team because they\nAll their all their instances like here in ... where you will do for ... to ... ... but the heart because ... county happens to have more uh more tornadoes and hail damage\nThan we do ... ... each area you're going to want to hold on and on those particular\nAspect of the property but once you've got your team you've got a lender you're going to need it going to be a we have ... what are you going to need a good to be a general contractor\nOr maybe you're going to go in with them will not quite so arguing with fixed up and you'll you won't need a handyman you'll need to check out for schools that are common in that area and these are all done by people who are just\nEqual the air it's common for foundation problems in that area that might be on one or two that they will go out and all that that people they can be your ... your ... on the ground floor you actually\nNeed eyes on the property need someone able to go out there for you so we have all the all white and our own ... in our area\nThe thing is you put in a little bit more ... to establish that came before you get into a property\nAnd that's I Know that's that's a powerful concept yeah and and ah I I to share and I get puzzled that a lone wolf\nA reputation that real estate investors have because we require such big teams in order to succeed you know you've got you've got your lenders your insurance agents you've got your contractors your handy man the trades you reverse your foundation folks your\nPlumbers and your electricians and it sounds like a big team to put together but it is not that difficult to put that team together\nAnd holding them together if you do what what we learn to do from Dell right which is to treat people while you pay your bills you have good communication you're educated and so you know what you want to do and you can speak with them and an educated way than they enjoy being part of your team they enjoyed the transitions they see you making\nIn your own business and in each property I should go whether that single family or multifamily and\nYou know you you talk about time getting to know the market at you and I went through an exercise in Las Vegas where we looked at property and in\nAbout an hour we got a handle on the market we learned some things that just delighted us and we we actually had a lot of fun together and evaluating property and we found out wow you know insurance is a lot less in Las Vegas than it is in Texas cities\nAnd you know every area has different things you know Phoenix has been a really fun market to evaluate I've enjoyed learning about Kentucky\nAnd um you know we're looking at different areas in St Louis and Kansas City and of course it Lana we've been\nThat members who have been investing in land for quite some time and I'm In Detroit since the recovery have been some amazing opportunities as well and each one of those markets has its own its own flavor and so you may have a

purely educational\nThis special edition episode is brought to you by killer Williams International\nK W labs in gateway mortgage group\nAnd what makes this show so special is that we have Mickey camera in here in the studio with us today from gateway mortgage group how you doing this morning Mickey attack that carry on doing excellent and you know I just wanted to let you know as the listener\nSome of the topics of today are unusual as usual\nAnd disruptive to the financial sector and if you don't allow yourself to slow down and listen to this whole show these topics may become disruptive to your personal finances and families\nSome of the topics we will be covering will be information that will change your life and secure your family's future\nSo anyway basically in a in a nutshell\nYou know I have Mickey camera in here today and she has been so immersed with in the back end of financial matters in mortgage real estate everything that has to do with the most important purchase that you possibly can make within your life\nThis show is disruptive enough\nOkay but I can tell you right now when you have real individuals and you know I I've been trying to get Mickey to tell you guys exactly how long she's been in the business and you know without you know wanting to date herself\nYou know I said over Thirty years [laughter] [laughter] well I have ... more years I came\nFrom one of the major banking lenders I won't say name but I tell you what they were so many rules and regulations and overlay that I thought that's the way life was\nBut ... years they're like dog years I'm like a hundred and sixty years old [laughter] I like good they think they have to wait you can't the listeners but I I'm not a I'm not worried\nFor sure Mickey and so I'm just glad I really wanted\nRight now when you have real individuals and you know I I've been trying to get Mickey to tell you guys exactly how long she's been in the business and you know without you know wanting to date herself\nYou know I said over Thirty years [laughter] [laughter] well I have two more years I came\nFrom one of the major banking lenders I won't say name but I tell you what they were so many rules and regulations and overlays and I thought that's the way life was\nThat ... years they're like dog years I'm like a hundred and sixty years old [laughter] I like that they think they just can't see less married but I I'm not a I'm not worried about yeah for\nSure Mickey and so I'm just glad I really wanted to drive home again you guys and you know I did mention you know kind of like how disruptive this can be because I Know which a lot of people get really really really\nJust caught up with the pace of life through the holidays in the holidays coming in you know my favorite holiday is ride around the corner\nAnd when we come into the holidays with the feds meeting two more times to raise interest rates what has taken place is that actually refinances have increased one point seven percent just within this month\nAnd when you look closely at kind of what the but the time versus money concept is technology doesn't care about that\nWe can use technology as a tool but we can't use technology in order to really get into the core matters of time versus money\nAnd you know these are some topics that aren't necessarily you know\nGoing to be covered within this particular special episode of the future of finance but that's kind of where this is heading organically\nIs time versus money and it's not to create a sense of urgency for you to pick up the phone like I said before this is purely educational for you to decide when you want to pick up the phone or when it's going to be the most important time\nFor you to pick up the phone and have a conversation with Mickey\nI think at that time is now and I don't ever think of anything as a waste of time\nSo you may be feeling like well you know I'm really not quite ready to buy into the spring or maybe in the summer but I've had so many people over the years that have come to me and we just talked about what it's going to look like and get that comfort level as yeah wow this is what the payments going to be\nThis is where I'd like to be then you get into that area which what hope\nAnd then I bring into reality but it's not good because it's better to know how to time than to go in blind so I always say the time now\nAnd you know that's a good point make it in that you know that's you know\nKind of it you know brings me to the fact that you know you you guys have heard Mickey speak directly to you about you know wanting a south facing driveway you know regarding you know the state of Colorado and I just want to make this very clear to you guys we have literally chosen\nCertain markets to really really assist with and the influx of what's coming in and out of the state of Colorado number one first and foremost from Colorado to Arizona and we all know the traveling back and forth\nAnd then I bring into reality but it's not bad because it's that it can never had a time and get going blind so I always say the title now\nAnd you know that's a good point Mickey and that you know that's you know\nTired of it you know brings me to the fact that you know you you guys have heard Mickey speak directly to you about you know wanting a south facing driveway you know regarding you know the state of Colorado and I just wanted to make this very clear to you guys we have literally chosen\nCertain markets to really really obsessed with and the influx of what's coming in and out of the state of Colorado number one first and foremost from Colorado to Arizona and we all know the traveling back and forth of the snow bird\nThe reason why that's important is that a lot of people do not understand that December is the most busiest time of the year with in real estate\nA lot of real estate agents don't even know that and they kind of just set their whole calendar up to say okay well I'm just going to take this next two to three weeks off\nWhile I can assure you with Keller Williams international and then also how gateway mortgage group had to position themselves\nAnd make the camera and as a host with myself Christopher bread well on the future of finance this December is going to be by far\nHow it's going to have more closings within the state of Colorado just because I have foresight within technology and what killer Williams has decided to do as far as purchasing certain bits and pieces of technology on the back end of even Zillow\nOkay in order and I all you have to do is watch\nYou know you know basically watch the news even on that topic that I'm bringing up to you within talk radio is that\nZillow stock is down there's there's certain companies out there\nToday that are even technology companies themselves that are being very very pressured and whether in because of disruptive technology\nAnd you know that's why I'm bringing the real human being to you giving you the access of eight four four yes gate the way to your future so you actually have the opportunity to pick up the phone right now\nAnd speak directly to Mickey camera and and this is an opportunity for you guys that's not going to always be there\nYou know and I just I Want to be honest with you so you don't get discouraged if you wait until December to pick up the phone and you can't even get a hold of Mickey camera and\nOh well well well well I have a strong team you will always be able to get a hold of me\nThat's what I Want to hear because I care more about you as the listener than anything that has to do with necessarily even the future of finance and because of the history of the future of finance you know that to be a fact\nI mean when it comes down to rhino philosophy when it comes down to home life balance\nTo be honest with you this is just a tool in order for me to connect you with somebody who really cares and you know Mickey\nThat brings us to a real for main topic which is compassion within the financial in banking industry which those two words because of my history with it\nMickey camera and oh well well well well\nI have a strong team you will always be able to get a hold of me well that's what I Want to hear because I care more about you as the listener\nThan anything that has to do with necessarily even the future of finance and because of the history of the future of finance you know that to be a fact\nI mean when it comes down to rhino philosophy when it comes down to home life balance\nTo be honest with you this is just a tool in order for me to connect you with somebody who really cares and you know Mickey\nThat brings us to a real for main topic which is compassion within the financial and banking industry which those two words because of my history within the business as far as being an asset manager dealing with the secondary market\nYou know working for some of the largest banks in the United states and you know\nJust compassion and financial banking industry\nAltogether it just like how do those words even how does that match how if you whether as being a woman of compassion\nOh you're kidding me it's not easy not every day there's the intent structure red tape Babylon\nCorporate sometimes my new shed that can make someone feel like they can't um uh-huh\nAnd that is what I feel in important to let everyone know that you can also no baseball\nHotdog apple pie and owning your own home\nIt's a big part of being in this country it's your opportunity and sometimes it may be not right now but it will be and that is really a big piece of mine moved to gateway gateway is very passionate about empowering families\nAnd they have a very strong work ethic and environment and to me a big part of mortgage is accountability and integrity\nSome things are outside of our control sometimes things get a little high plains on an inspection or value or whatever but I'm not going to turn tail and hide I'm right there up front and center with you negotiating\nI just you know as you're talking and I'm hearing that there's a real human being that is\nOn mass media that's physically reaching the airwaves as a host on the future of finance it gives me chills right now because you know and the fact that you can call one\nEight four four yes gate the way to your future is\nAbsolute it it just blows me away you guys ... and I'll tell you why\nIt really comes down to\nThree things you know and you know actually I'm not going to even tell you why I'm gonna let Mickey tell you why what that experience is going to be like when you actually pick up the phone and you know before we go there I Want to just you know think\nReal human being that is on mass media that's physically reaching the airwaves as a host on the future a finance it gives me chills right now because you know and the fact that you can call one\nEight four four yes gate the way to your future is\nAbsolute it it just blows me away you guys ... and I'll tell you why\nIt really comes down to basically three things\nYou know and you know actually I'm not going to even tell you why I'm gonna let Mickey tell you why\nWhat that experience is going to be like when you actually pick up the phone and you know before we go there\nI Want to just you know think every single every single one of my listeners [laughter] you know to you know to be sitting and listening closely why and I know why\nLike freedom you have now in order to really help like say for instance somebody who just graduated college and they're paying let's say\nThree thousand dollars a month downtown Denver for a one bedroom loft like ... you know and they don't even know they can afford a home to purchase a home like what are some of the tools that you have in your school box\nIn order to be able to let them know that hey you know what you're not going to have to resign that leaves you really\nGo ahead I Would say could send the first part of your question where I came from and the net a major lender\nLarge banking institution I never realized all the rules and overlay that I had and I think over the years as what I can do now like gateway that it couldn't be then all of them are people I could've helped\nSeriously when I came to gateway and I saw our minimal amount of overlays or in other words in the mortgage eats land that means extra both\nGuide kind of happy tears because they knew and I had so much more flexibility\nAnd the support\nOf a team that strong and underwriters that are compassionate it's a together in one big family up gateway\nAnd you know that's really neat because from my understanding and just so you guys you know yeah I Do I Am on the tax side I Do wear the tech guy and a lot of things I Want to provide technical information on it's just the way I'm wired\nYou know and it does have to do with the rhino philosophy of being able to rally around and you know [noise]\nGrant that mean extra herbal kite kind of happened to tears because they knew and I had so much more flexibility and support\nAs a team that strong and underwriters that are compassionate if a together in one big family gave way\nAnd you know that's really neat because from my understanding and just so you guys know yeah I Do I Am on the tax side I Do wear the tech guy and a lot of things I Want to provide technical information on it's just the way I'm wired\nYou know and it does have to do with the rhino philosophy of being able to rally around\nAnd you know just to recap you know just kind of just to you know let those who may not know what the rhino philosophy is is in a lot of people don't know this but in Africa if there is a fire\nUp to like a hundred million I mean\nTo me it would be a hundred million miles away because I wouldn't be able to even make it probably five miles in the middle of the desert of Africa but up to a hundred miles away a rhino if it smells a fire in the jungle\n... some of the fastest moving animals and they will\nThe whole herd won't run to where it sounds like an earthquake toward that fires that and they will run in a circle\nBefore intel suffocate the fire and puts the fire\nOut so that's really basically instead of this being you know a round table we're going to have gas coming on the show and you know instead of having it be a round table you guys have no idea how many rhinos\nThat are behind what we're doing here on the airwaves today there are so many rhinos that are running already\nBeing proactive instead of reactive and circling around where they are already see this little tiny tiny fire that's going to start in the jungle which I'm basically using it as an analogy for Wall Street\nGay because there are I'm not being negative by saying that there are going to be times that are changing because of technology because of the millennial generation who haven't been given the\nThe tools needed in ... and the education and knowledge like Mickey was saying of power the knowledge is power to be able to be calm homeowners become stable within their lives a lot of them have literally\nDriven themselves into debt to get the best possible education possible\nAnd\nThey think that they're stuck leasing at three thousand dollars a month you follow what I'm saying you guys so it's just really important you know and that's one of the things you know when I was actually going through the process of of you know through rhinos giving suggestions and\nI mean I'm not going to go into bragging on what you know who these people are and the type of backing that we have in order to make sure that hopefully every single person in the United states\nGet here what type of options they really do have to become a homeowner\nAnd also be able to position themselves to be able to weather the storm\nBut I'm telling you right now the first step is picking up the phone and not eight four four yes gate\nTo get the best possible education possible\nAnd they think that they're stuck leasing at three thousand dollars a month you follow what I'm saying you guys so it's just really important you know and that's one of the things you know when I was actually going through the process of of you know through rhinos giving suggestions and\nI mean I'm not going to go into bragging on what you know who these people are and the type of backing that we have in order to make sure that hopefully every single person in the United states get here what type of options they really do have to become a homeowner\nAnd also be able to position themselves to be able to weather the storm\nBut I'm telling you right now the first step is picking up the phone\nAnd not eight four four yes gate the way to your future again that a four four yes gate the wage here future and Mickey you know your heart for the millennials for as you say the young groups\nSay it's something that before this episode and I really want you to kind of speak to them directly and make sure that they understand that they're not dealing with somebody who is detached from exactly where they're at\nOh absolutely absolutely it just so much potential in every moment in New and infinite potential\nAnd I know my parents my creativity and stream I truly profound and I can achieve anything\nYou want you wake up in the morning at ... ... ... ... you can accomplish and with tried even more so\nAnd you know what's interesting is is that basically you know one of the reasons why Mickey camera and and this particular episode is so special because we are actually taking tons of resources\nAnd all the tools that we have to make sure that this generation that's coming up that's we're gonna have to give a major responsibility to\nThat they're well equipped better equipped than we ever were and that's by picking up the phone and calling a four four yes gate the way to your future again that aid for four yes gate the way to your future\nAnd we are not leaving the baby boomers behind\nThere are so many tools as far as on the remark reverse mortgage type of thing that Mickey I Know has but that's not what this particular episode of the future of finances about what it's about is making sure say for instance my identical twin boys look annoy just turned Eighteen\nOkay they both have had the best education\nTheir college has already paid for thank God\nBut the reality as they have no clue\nThat they could own a home right now I don't know why Mickey they don't teach with in like mainstream education even at the best universities unless someone is going to go to education specifically for finance and one of the things that I'm not saying this about any particular\nYou know educational institution but for some reason it's like it's kinda like top secret private information on what\nBut that's not what this particular episode of the future of finances about what it's about is making sure say for instance my identical twin boys Luke annoy just turned Eighteen okay they both have had the best education their college has already paid for thank God\nBut the reality as they have no clue\nThat they could own a home right now I

real estate it's still kind of leading thing telling everybody can be fun [laughter] [laughter] you\nDon't tell exactly you know so you guys pick up the phone at a four four yes gate the way to your future again that eight four four yes get the way to your future and there's so many more topics\nThat we're going to be equipping the millennials with especially within shows to come and ask this rose you know the San Francisco region\nOr I is a really really important region to us it's almost I mean literally connected to the hip with Boulder\nColorado and we see so many people comment\nInto Colorado from Silicon Valley with like they're like a deer in the headlights they're like oh my gosh\nWe can't believe property value is is where it's hot and and you know they're having to share one bedroom loss downtown and you know to where like say for instance you think oh well I can only afford like Seventeen fifty a month\nSo I'm going to split this last time I'm going to have to have a

I remember it was an August and I'm thinking of a two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on and talking about\nHow people were losing trust in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was the only two groups in and this was before Ferguson by the way some remember that part of it so whatever that you know few months before that so they re\n... there were only two institutions that more than half the people in this country had faith in one of which was the military at Seventy seven percent and the other was cops at about fifty two percent\nAnd one of the points I made was and again this was pretty Ferguson is you know there was a lot of pressure already be put on kind of people's views of cops and that may not be holding given that it was only fifty two percent back then and that would have very important implications\nI have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives are going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very ...\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people are predicting that I don't know if they're right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just 'cause I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the class I'm going to be teaching is before the crash and the idea of this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is\nBefore the market goes down you gotta know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up\nBut the average retail trade or will never make money and the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I just want a thought too about you know people keep coming in and told me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors will define investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realize that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble they put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong\nAnd again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is that when the market turns down can turn down very quickly if you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of games think about this from it Thirteen Years of games in a year and a half okay\nIf you want Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now\nHow is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down and you can on the move up so getting class we're gonna talk about all these ideas we're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people will focus on what's called technical analysis they using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked with are like four okay you know you have your ... to camp to extend your are your uh see the eyes and you know there's a vote for thousands or hundreds of these things right\nSo how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one and within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\nThere are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the bats they've got a I won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of the guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that\nSeveral thousands or hundreds of these things right so how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one and within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\nThere are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got a I won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecast is really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now\nAnd the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes [laughter] and that's a lot of this is that people use something because it's the best they think they've got but it's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things are really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market to supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make there's a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but we always make sure that when we're wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing\nAs opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do so again if you want to come out to a class I'm going to be teaching

I've taught this class before it's always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those would be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThey the world has changed in my opinion from a marketing arena manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you can always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at a charge than looking it indicators which are the wrong thing there's a fundamental we'd better approach again that I was teaching a class so if you want to come out you can get to free tickets free tablet plus we'll feed you launch\nBe one of the next dozen callers at eighty four forty eight trader that's T.

Street Journal today that of the companies that are going public this year eighty three percent of them are losing money\nNow that is the highest in recorded history anytime they've tracked that this is the biggest number of it's ever been in his now eclipse what was happening in the year two thousand or eighty one percent of the companies were not profitable\nWhen companies are going public and then the stocks are going up which many of these stocks are where there are these ridiculous evaluation\nThere would've known as unicorn stock these companies that have no profits that are worth a billion dollars or more\nThat is a sign of a bubble and that is a sign that we are closer to the end than we are to the beginning of this Ron\nThere's another story I just read that\nCharles Schwab investors which a classic retail traders are now sitting on less cash than they've been at any time in history so they're becoming quote unquote fully invested well that is a lot of implications what drives the market it's supply and demand if you've taken away the demand\nAnd there isn't more money on the sidelines to kind of come in and then what's going to take the market up to the next level\nNow what's been taking it up is companies buying back to their own stock and companies are buying back a record amount of stock this year they've never bought so much and that constrains supply and that could drive this market higher again\nThis is it I don't want to be giving you some big doom and gloom thing this market can keep going higher\nThan the repatriation of all that money coming back from overseas is a huge part of what's driving this market higher now it's a one time deal but some of the people aren't spending the money this year that could spend it next year so maybe you got a little bit left in the tank next year but at some point it has to come down\nAnd again we need to be prepared for that before it happens\nWe got to have the fundamental skills to be able to benefit from this happens\nBecause you can actually make more money faster on the downside than the upside but at a minimum we've got to know how to protect what we've got so again the classroom and to be teaching on before the crash what do you do and also what we're going to cover his what if he keeps going up what should we be doing\nThere's always a way to make money in this market but we always have to start with risk management\nAgain be one of the next dozen callers you can get to free tickets free tablet when you come out the number to call is eight for for eight eight seven twenty

the trade right side of the trade is brought you buy online training academy Phoenix deliberating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education All right this week we've been talking about\nThe ... kind of the state of the market and why I think we're closer to the top than the bottom at this point by a very long way and in fact why you may see a top in this market pretty soon\nYou know early this year I said I thought you'd see the top this year and we don't we haven't really gone much above where we were in January kind of gone back and forth around there\nYou know I said we could have one more run this year and you could look anything's possible you could even get a bit of a run next year but what's going to keep taking this market higher and in the last segment I told you a little bit about what I see an evidence of the top and the market\nOne is the fact that more companies are going public selling shares initial public offering to ... cattle more companies that have no profits than ever in history so Wall Street journal today to the eighty three percent of the company's going public right now have an earnings are gone public the last twelve months no earnings\nIn two thousand the height of the dot com it was eighty one percent\nSo that again is kind of a big bubble each time\nNext big bubbly sign that the fact that you go to a place like Charles Schwab where it's retail traders not professionals\nOkay they have their customers have less cash sitting on the sidelines then they've had an ad I think at any time in history if I remember correct but they don't have a lot of extra money now you combine that with something else we've talked about before on the show which is what's called margin debt\nRight now in this country people are barred about six hundred and sixty billion dollars to buy stocks that's about three and a quarter percent of gross domestic product the entire US Economy so what's happening is is people are taking the money they have been buying stock because most people are massively behind the eight ball you know and trust and the other day\nThat if you look at people even in their sixties\nThe average person had something like a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and assets okay hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars is going to get you anywhere with all due respect and retirement\nTo really get to where most people need to be you're talking millions which means most people aren't going to get where they need to be you can still do better but you know most people are going to be in the hole on that but a hundred and Seventy five not close\nBut what's amazing about it it's almost all equity in houses now part of what's driving the equity in houses is\nThe root for real estate the mortgage rates are so low but they're going up and here's kind of again of big key in the top when\nHave this much margin debt what happens is is that as people borrow more and more money to buy stock so like when you buy stock you don't have to put up all the money just put up half of it\nPart of what's driving the equity in houses is the root for real estate the mortgage rates are so low\nBut there are going up and here's kind of again a big key in the top when you have this much margin debt", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cave Creek", "day": "18"}
