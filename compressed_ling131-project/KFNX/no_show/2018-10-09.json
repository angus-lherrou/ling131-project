own city in your lifetime\nThey've toned down the name of Columbus they want to go after all the founding fathers\nI Want to tell you that before we talk about Christopher Columbus per se before anyone talks about any explorer or scientists artist the politician we need to understand the subjects motivation background than environment\nAgain as a part time best selling novelist\nI can tell you that one of the greatest jokes in modern socio political propaganda is that the kind of basic detail every read of demands in fiction\nSuch as why is that sea captain chasing them white whale or why is Dorothy so unhappy in Kansas somehow this was not required to make president in real life in the ... of the left and right in other words fiction has to be more real than reality\nAnd that's not surprising if the mainstream media had looked carefully and objectively at the back story of Iraq\nAnd Michelle Obama the Obamas never would have lived in the White House and if we give Columbus the courtesy do any historical subject it would not be possible to manipulate gullible\nSocial justice warriors into up ending his statue or that a robbery or anyone else and I'm going to talk about

decreed that within four months all Jews had to leave Spain those who I converted to Catholicism the converse of steak the eight hundred thousand Jews are not converted we're out\nOf course an unknown number of the converse shows or attending mass but still secretly practicing Judaism these people these human beings are known as ... swine\nAnd I've used this word ... to describe conservatives who continue to be conservative in secret in this country\nYou understand where that came from\nLet me continue there is good evidence that Columbus was Spanish name was Cristobal cologne was Jewish probably or possibly um around all the evidence is found in the will he signed on march Nineteen fifty no sex in it he honored the Jewish custom of leaving a portion of his wealth to the needy\nHe's specifically named Elizabeth ... as the beneficiary of a portion of the state\nColumbus also earmarked part of his estate\nTo go to a group that was charged with retaking Jerusalem for its Muslim occupiers and finally he signed a document with a triangle of marks that appeared on Jewish headstones those dots and characters were intended to represent the ... the Jewish prayer for the deceased\nI'm going to continue in a few minutes reading about\nThe real history of\nChristopher Columbus one of the greatest explorers in the history of the world and the sadness that we should all feel today that we permitted the communists and the fascist of our time to the famed this great explorer and to rip down\nHis name across America and it's all found\nIn a book that you must have even

the Jews and the fifteenth century\nIn order to twenty Seventeen just days after a terror attack in Barcelona kill fourteen and injured more than one hundred others the chief rabbi of that city gave an interview in which he won that Spain had become an extra for Islamic terror\nThe Spanish rabbi said I tell my congregants don't think we're here for good\nAnd I encourage them to buy property in Israel this place is lost don't repeat the mistake of Algerian Jews or Venezuelan Jews Europe is lost he described the Muslim community in Europe as harboring radicals and terrorists and one is very difficult to get rid of them they only get stronger\nAnd I'll let you read for yourself\nThe book mass hysteria this is one example\nOf what I'm trying to do before it might be too late if it's not too late already and I don't think it's ever too late by the way so Columbus Day is no longer a holiday for the namesake Ohio capital\nWhy is Christopher Columbus been turned into the most evil person\nWas he that he will a person\nAnd by the way what was life like for most of the indigenous peoples\nIn the areas that he landed on what what would they liked to each other where they kind of loving\nWhere they ... some kind of at the end of the angels as you would have the as they would have you believe all of these uh lecturers of ethnic studies whatever you believe that the Native American was living in peace and harmony with each other and with nature nothing could be further from the truth\nI have studied this issue since Nineteen Seventy the Nineteen seventies if you look at

and replace them with their own I'm surprised in a caller Carl Marx day because that's coming next\nI mean if you think that this is a joke you're mistaken\nThe radical left has no infiltrated every

was shot and years ago in Arizona a Scott Kelly a hero right astronaut served his country but he's a man of the left over the weekend after Kavanaugh gets sworn in\nAnd everybody on the ride and all the Kavanaugh supporters are you know a\nA high five in each other and drinking beer and chug getting beer and and and just and and people on the left for complaining that the the Kavanaugh supporters were acting like bad winters they were like shoving it in the face\nOf people on the left so Scott Kelly tweets out a quote from certain Winston Churchill\nOne of the greatest or leaders of modern times by the way sir Winston Churchill a Scott Kelly tweets out a a quote from Churchill\nIn victory magnanimity I guess those days are over Churchill quote in victory um be a good winter right\nJust like you don't want to be a bad news or ... or ... be a good winter be respectful don't in in in the end and we'd be chip right\nBe magnanimous be big\nSo Scott Kelly sends out that tweet south that quote from Churchill and with in about oh I don't\nKnow two hours Scott\nKelly tweets out an apology\nShore to God did not mean here it is here's his tweet his apology did not mean to offend anybody by quoting Churchill\nMy apologies I Will go and educate myself further on his atrocities his racist views which I Do not support\nMy point was that we need to come together as one nation we are all Americans that should transcend partisan\nPolitics\nWhat happened in two hours well you know what happened\nThe crazy nut so mob on the left all tweeted right back\nAt Scott Kelly how dare you quote Winston Churchill he was a bad guy\nHe's a horrible guy he committed a lot of uh of atrocities he starved three million Indians to death he advocated in used chemical weapons he betrayed Poland or he sold half of Europe to stall and you can't be quoting Winston Churchill\nOne of the greatest leaders of modern times\n\nSo the left went after Kelly their own because he quoted Winston Churchill\nAnd look I ah I expect that kind of thing from the left\nJefferson was nothing but a racist slave owner George Washington was nothing but a racist slave owner\nBack at Scott Kelly how dare you quote Winston Churchill he was a bad guy\nHe was a horrible guy he committed a lot of uh of atrocities he starved three million Indians to death he advocated in used chemical weapons he betrayed Poland or he sold half of Europe stalling you can't be quoting Winston Churchill\nOne of the greatest leaders of modern times\n\nSo the left went after Kelly their own because he quoted Winston Churchill\nAnd look I ah I expect that kind of thing from the left\nThomas Jefferson was nothing but a racist slave owner George Washington was nothing but a racist slave owner I get that right Winston Churchill ah I guess the left believes that Winston freaking Churchill is no different than styling\nJust some old dead white guy who oppressed people\nBut what's what's so sad is what so weak is Scott Kelly tweeted out an apology key cow town to this left to smile\n\nWinston Churchill or you you you could argue\nOr was the greatest public figure of the twentieth century\n[noise] in fact all of these uh liberal twists\nIn America who are who jumped all over Scott Kelly 'cause he tweeted out of Winston Churchill quote all of these there's there is a good chance that all these leftist twists are right now would be speaking German\nIf not for the actions of one Winston Churchill but they don't know their history\nThey don't know their history and so he apologizes\n\nOr author Paul Reed who co wrote the final volume of the Churchill biography last lion well he tweeted Scott Kelly\nAnd he said Scott Kelly please read a good biography of Churchill before making pronouncements on his atrocities and racist views he committed no atrocities and his views on race a hundred years ago cannot be judged by today's standards\n\nAnd furthermore sir read tweeted Kelly by saying you're going to further educate yourself on Churchill's atrocities implies the fixes in I humbly request that you read the last Ryan which I co wrote with William Manchester\n\nThe left is nuts and they're dangerous they want to whitewash and rewrite history\n\nThey want Thomas Jefferson to be bad and evil they want and George Washington to be bad and evil and son of a gun I didn't see this one comment but after this

that back and says men to what has been broken\nIf something's broken God gave you the knowledge and the wisdom how to fix it you should go in and fix it\nBecause he's flesh and blood just like you just once you've messed up and did something that was wrong he's your brother and Christ you should go there and help him that's right because God of look at you and say that's my boy\nThat's right

break off a person\nThat one person says you know that the what the first of all of them is to them then\nYou love me it's the person who cares about me as for his first is the true man of God I Want that and that's when you see the change in person when you show them that you have changed that's right he tell them look I did the same thing you're doing right now I went down to save pat you're on

I did too much\nAnd you don't want to go read pat you don't want to experience that feeling you want to experience the love God the grace of God to the mercy of God you want to know that God loves me and wants to help me you don't want to get into the darkness that hurts and that you feel alone and you're not in the God does not even looking at you\nSo all you gotta do is tell someone you love them and if you messed up in any of these one areas these two areas I mean what are you condemn yourself from what you've done was wrong or you condemning others will just solution is the description that we're going to go to as he was twelve to\n\nAnd it it talks about faith and you might look at it why is this guy mentioned the faith well I'll tell you guys the reason why I mentioned the faith because at one point\nThere was so much I used to conduct myself so much Wednesday that I didn't believe God could take the sit down in my life there you go when I used to do the same thing over and over and over and over every day seven eight times a day probably ten times a day\nI got to the point that I didn't believe that my God that could do anything to take this out of my life I mean it came to the point that I ... I had no belief no I didn't think I Would change I didn't think that this would have been out of my life\nAnd the Bible says\nAnd ah you know what let's leave it rents good or read a twelve one therefore since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses to the life of faith\nLet us slip off every weight that slows down especially if it's in there so easily tripped up and let us run with it and during the race of God has said before as we do this hold on\nWe do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus the shame in men in ... uh author and professor of our faith because of the joy of waiting him endured across this discarding shame now he said it and the place of honor besides God's throne\nAnd bless you I I even search what does the word often a million and Greek and the ones that come and get the word author in Greek I mean and it's\nOne that takes the lead in anything right and that's what I searched what's the word author the Bible is just told us that Jesus is the fact that basically it was\nHe's the he's the one that finishes as we don't do it that's right so we have to do is run to God what\nHold on we do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus the shame in men in ... uh author and professor of our faith because of the joy of waiting him endured across this discarding shame now he said it\nAnd the place of honor besides God's throne and bless you I I even search what does the word often a million and Greek\nAnd the ones that are going to get\nThe word author in Greek I mean and the ...\nThe\nOne that takes the lead in anything right and that's what I searched what's the word author\nThe Bible is just told us that Jesus is the effect that basically it was\nHe's the he's the one that finishes as we don't do it that's right so we have to do is run to God what everything that we've got the Bible says slip off every cent especially the one that slipped off so we go to him\nGo to him what to sit and let him slipping offer you let them take the send away from you you're struggling with condemning others you're struggling with condemning yourself whatever the struggle that may be the ...

the left wing in action\nLast week in a way that was so naked\nThat it would take a real dummy not to see how evil they actually are not how they became\nThey reversed all the rules of law at of ethics and if they should say\nAnd the only question is will this reflect\nIn November ah at the ballot box and I don't know I think it I think it will because women\nIn particular who are deciding factor in many elections who are the reason Trump is president never forget that it was late surge of white\nMiddle class suburban women\nThat slung over to Trump at the end of the election last time that that put them over the finish line and the question is will they come over again and large enough numbers to save America from the communist jogging or or where we start the in the same

organizations literally overnight with a letter\nAnd their funding will dry up\nAnd it has to be done it's as simple as that there are ways that a non violent\nWhere you could face these violent people without violence\nAnd I'm afraid that if we don't we're going to have another catch they probably in this country I sent it to someone over the weekend I don't know if any of your old enough to remember Nineteen Seventy I saved a newspaper from that time because uh\nIt was a significant year for many many ways\nI'll never forget what happened at Kent State university\nAnd the killings at Kent State changed the course of American politics\nYou see the radicals were agitated\nIt's an intergenerational group of agitator incident with the old hippies of that time are still alive\nAnd they've cultivated an entire generation of new hippies if you want to call them that and the old hippies got them onto the streets against the Vietnam War against LBJ and they started rioting on the college campus called Kent State\nWell the governor of a state called out the national guard they fixed bayonets and they faced off against the rabble the long haired rabbit was threatened to take down take down the whole campus\nOr the riders didn't stop no one had ever stop them before\nUnfortunately the rest is historically factual\nSomebody amongst the national guard open fire on them and then others that the little form of mass hysteria by the way and the number of students were shot dead on that campus\nOne of the results of it in addition to the tragedy of the students being shot\nWas that the entire student movement came to a grinding halt suddenly they cut their hair and went home to mommy\nAnd took a job and McDonald's\nThere were no longer out there in the streets rioting because they were afraid that they could get shot dead by the national guard\nAnd I'm afraid that this was going to happen if they keep taunting the police if they keep taunting senators if they keep harassing people in restaurants how long is it going to be until a senator\nWho is armed and license to carry\nFeel threatened enough to pull a gun on one of them you think it can happen I

and he he gave me a personal tour of Congress\nShowed me a group of marble stairs aback staircase into into the house of representatives that still has blood on the steps and he told me that there was actually a shootout\nBetween a journalist and a congressman\nBecause the journalist has smeared the congressmen over and over and over again\nTaunted them over and over and over again you think it's new today there's in the Eighteen eighties well it turns out that the journalists came to\nCongress with a gun in his hand I don't remember his name and shot the congressman dead on the steps and the blood is still there in the steps now I'll give you another example you may not notice but it's it's history this oil and mass hysteria again those you know the history of those who do not know they're strict condemned to repeat it I Hope you learn the history of you're not condemned to repeat it do you know that in the early Nineteen fifties\nA group of Puerto Rican nationalist broke into the gallery in the U.S Congress and opened fire on congressman below and killed a number of them did you know that and so when you see the pain cats or the women screaming and yelling it's not amusing to me\nIt's a form of violence that must be stopped\nAnd the only way to stop them is by passing much stricter laws about who can enter Congress stop at the people's house garbage already without living in the in the early days of the founding here where we're now infiltrated\nWere infiltrated they're everywhere they're running the television shows they've infiltrated the university's they've infiltrated the ... the peaceful front groups\nAnd it's only a matter of time until one of these lunatics\nShoots a senator or congressman and I think that we need to take preemptive action to prevent another massacre in Congress as occurred in the early fifties when a group of Puerto Rican national ... open fire from the galleries on Congress below now what am I the only person in America remembers that story yes\nAm I the only author in America who knows that story I Can't be am I the only broadcaster who knows that story probably\nAnd here I Am would stop mass hysteria having to tell

the United states on every flag waving national anthem\nSaluting veteran respecting police honoring founding fathers cherishing patriotic American the conservative side\nDid not realize that we are at war until the last two weeks and I believe that this upcoming election and America's future is on the ballot people are going to vote for in America where you are guilty until proven innocent or in America where you are innocent until proven guilty\nBruce you do you think that Republicans have the guts to make that argument because you make the argument easily that this really is about whether or not the presumption is there and if not what does it mean but I think I get the feeling that while the left seemingly will do almost anything to win\nThat there are a lot of conservatives who are afraid to see something now we've had pleasant surprises from\nPeople like Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham who was a riot are bug do the rest of the Republican ... have the you know the the backbone to say this is what we're up against and do you want that kind of America where the ... we are\nWell and this question has a\nTwo layer to answer on the political side of the elected officials I think after\nWatching Lindsey Graham become a rock star overnight I think what what team did last week made him to start at the met met it defined him through his political career and I think really the you know what if you develop a backbone if you speak passionately it will resonate with the people\nBecause what Lindsey Graham dead is he echoed the voice of president Donald Trump for the last two years and the way he spoke the courage to display the moral clarity you spoke the authority he spoke with\nAnd that touched a nerve and the American public so I Hope that the other elected officials who are running this election thinking well if I Want my spot them the lights mind day in the sunshine I Need to start speaking more boldly la Donald Trump and Lindsey Graham on the ground fruit side\nYou know a lot of conservatives are not emotional people there are logical people so we are not that people are going to show up on the side of the road demonstrate I break glass break buildings that create a riot block\nHighways it's not in our nature this is not what we do but go set up to this point thought well if I just go out and vote you know that that will be it I'm going to make my voice known but what what we saw in the last two weeks so conservative that\nActivism goes far beyond just the voting every two years there are a lot of things you can do between the two years and I hope that that I chose conservatives how much the left is organized and they need to be involved in grassroots movements that are fighting on behalf of our country\nI'll give you a perfect example with my organization ad for America we saw a spike because of the cabinet where people came because they wanted to know what they can do as a citizen and that's what I lay out in my book rise I wrote my book rise in defense of American values and freedom because\nI wanted to give people ideas and tips as to what they can do to make a difference\nFor example at the end of every chapter I have a section titled rise up and act or I'd do people three things you can do\nThat the activism both far beyond just voting every two years there are a lot of things you can do between the two years and I hope that that I chose conservative how much the left as organized and they need to be involved in grassroots movements that are fighting on behalf of our country\nI'll give you a perfect example my organization at for America we saw a spike because of the cabinet where people came because they wanted to know what they can do as a citizen and that's what I lay out in my book I wrote my book rise in defense of American values and freedom because\nI wanted to give people ideas and tips as to what they can do to make a difference\nFor example at the end of every chapter I have a section titled rise up and act or I Do people three things you can do under ten minutes and you can do them while sipping your cup of coffee in the morning\nAnd get the job was sitting in front of your computer\nThat's a great way to do it now will there also be some suggestions in there for elected officials because Bridgette I Would love to see citizens turn up at public meetings and I would apply this to Republicans he rose Democrats and Republicans especially\nThere are so many Republicans who won't say something even though it seems very apparent that they want to lead you to believe they are in favor of something but they don't want to see it out loud they don't want to say the words where you just said saying\nIf you believe in the presumption of innocence you have to support what we just did and if you don't then you ought to be prepared to explain to your fellow citizens while you're willing to throw somebody under the bus and what are you going to say when they come and do it to your friends or your family members\nI Need I Need the citizens to go to to elected officials and demand that they speak the truth plainly\nExactly and I and and he said perfect words because we know they did it together now next they're coming to you know they're coming up to your sons that coming after your family and and this was on display in Washington DC the last two weeks it's not going to end with Kevin Oh\nI Know it's interesting you mentioned the town hall meetings in the last\nChapter of my book arise I have a whole chapter is dedicated how citizens rich people like you and me who need to get that voice out\nHow to show up to a thousand hold meetings and how to ask questions to your elected officials I even lay out a plan how to make friends help set across the audience helps to have a pre within questions how to stand up and ask these questions how to set up your elected official to understand that you represent the majority in your community you know\nThe left wrote books on how to mobilize the grassroots or whether it was organizing for action by President Obama weather now indivisible resist look I signed up to get all these leftist organizations um\nEmails by the way right now in law says you and I are speaking there are eighty five left is the grassroots movements operating in the country and mobilizing on the right side people are asleep\nSo what I Hope to do and that book rise and I encourage single person who is listening to end this interview right now to go out they get the book because it's a road map not\nOnly to how you can call your elected officials on hold their feet to the fire but also how globalize in your community to show up the city council meetings to show up to I I liked it official town hall meetings\nTo elected official on the spot and record their answers how to use your cell phones as a tool to spread messages on your social media we on the right you need to understand that and the tools that make us powerful grassroots citizens participating in the future about what country\nLast year when they are speaking there are five states the grassroots movements operating the country and mobilizing on sleep so how did you end up book wise\nAnd I encourage a single person in the center here right now to go out and get the book because it's so not only do you can call fission was on hold their feet to the fire\nBut oh well my wife and your community to show the city council meetings\nTo show to get official meetings I like to play so I don't record the answer is how to use your cell phones to spread messages on your social media we understand that to\nMake a whole grassroots citizens in the future of our country\nAnd that decision or may not be have an effect and killed four generations to come\nAnd I I get frustrated when people I agree with politically will show up at a meeting they'll get the opportunity to ask you questions and then they either want to stand up and give a speech before the sequester not ... and good sometimes\nThe simplest questions are you going to ask you will you support new gun control will you do something about building a wall and and then just to amplify by saying and I want a simple answer that we all understand a yes or no not something that allows you to skate out either side\nMake the question less than two sentences long preferably one is less than one sentence long long because otherwise politicians are used to the non answer the question they don't want to answer\nExactly the way you phrase it because that's exactly what they need to do you ask your question\nAnd stop speaking to go back and forth to the elected official and giving you that what they stand on so I'd be like that that is very clear\nCannot beat around but what they said the question I'm sure that your friends who are you at that town hall meeting that you don't get that meeting I stand there with a cell phone running\nFor the official looking at the audience to know that he had to answer to be shared on social media these human needs to stand as a conservative how how about life in your community because this is exactly what you need to do the same thing\nOr new book is the New York times best seller it's called ... she has received Gabriel terrorism expert in Sherman of act for America retreated it's always a pleasure thanks for the time\nSaid to my friend great to be with you here and now today it's Columbus Day said again happy Columbus Day we'll talk about a great celebration of what a mirror makes America great or worse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor religious liberty for 'em to pursue commercial success and in more than one case because they needed to get out of town wherever they were from and they needed some place where they could just start over under a new name and no one would ask them the best yup\nBut we have we have had continuous cycle of this\nUm you know it it it it you know and the Spanish wants to certain parts of North America and the French wants to certain parts of the record math and English and the Dutch\nWent to a certain parts are different than that and then we had you know various and sundry wars and some people stopped coming and some people move and some people laugh\nAnd then pretty much we had you know this this geographic area for 'em up that became known as the Thirteen colonies and then the Thirteen original states the United states of America\nAnd then we had more people from England and then we had lots of Germans and they only has lots of Irish and then we had lots of eastern Europeans and then we have lots of southern Europeans and we had lots of Jews come over mixed in with that and he had Muslims come other next in with that and when everybody got here\nYes it did hit Haiti everybody go through some level of unpleasantness yeah probably all of them but just about shovel all so everybody has the opportunity to pursue\nAnd excel and and and that she\nGreatness and you know now we

in your resume from history and rates in from the public square literally a New York city and Columbus Circle to be able to honor other people who came here why aren't there aren't very many

through channels\nUm without 'em and and make it they come here underground they become a sub culture and they cease to assimilate and that's one one of the important things about the American

I don't don't react yet we've got a new administration coming in that you would have seen that whether there was\nCooperation between the Trump team and the Russians for the election you might have seen that just because well for the same reason that a President Obama said on an on a hot and Mike\nUh ... I'll have more flexibility after the election well he did have more flexibility to me\nIt's interesting that if it were just sort of run of the mill ordinary signaling between a pending administration and a foreign government yeah why would why did Flynn and go to such lengths to lie about it he lied to the vice president\nThey lied to Sean Spicer lied to the FBI have you figure that one has board that is one of the puzzles of as if it's all above board why is there such effort across the Trump Administration to service suppressed aids fact tonight effects it's similarly to Trump's initial explanation of the Trump Tower meeting obviously as I live on so many revisions\nIf there's nothing to hide why are they doing so much hiding\nI think that's a legitimate question but\nI I I I've been ... politically confused on this and obviously Greg as the author of The Apprentice soon as a man who covers national security you're much more ... than in this than I Am I still don't understand why one Flint agreed to talk to the FBI\nAnd then when it became clear that they were asking about conversations he had that you would think would be intercepted I mean as\nAs an essay wouldn't he have known that everything he said on the phone line to the Russian ambassadors people or to the Russian ambassador himself\nWas going to be on a transcript somewhere and that the FBI was trying to say we want to see if you will tell us what we already know and what we already have so it makes me wonder whether the FBI had deliberately set out to say we know every word he says let's see if we can get them to tell a different version then we've got 'em in a process cry\nHey there's a lot of\nDetail in the book that has not surfaced publicly because I've ... I was involved in breaking the ... story for the Washington Post and gone over that sweet sequence of events in detail with dozens of additional interviews for the book it's not only that\nMike Flynn should have known having been director of the defense intelligence agency what a sort of surveillance exists of\nA foreign adversaries here in the United states but in fact they were people inside the Trump transition course\nThe Russian ambassadors people or to the Russian ambassador himself was going to be on a transcript somewhere and the FBI was trying to say we want to see if you will tell us what we already know and what we already have\nSo it makes you wonder whether the FBI had deliberately set out to say we know every word he says let's see if we can get him to tell a different version then we've got 'em in a process crime\nHey there's a lot of\nDetail in the book that has not surfaced publicly because I've ... I was involved in breaking the ... story for the Washington Post and gone over that sweet sequence of events in detail of dozens of additional interviews for the book it's not only that Mike Flynn should have known having then director of the defense intelligence agency what\nA sort of surveillance exists of\nA foreign adversaries here in the United states but in fact they were people inside the Trump transition\nWho are so alarmed about the Trump\nInner circle sort of teams interactions with Russia signals about Russia that they tried to stage an intervention with planned after a meeting in which he talked about needing to have a conversation with the Russian ambassador there were people who are trying to get to see a profile of the Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak and Mike Flynn's hands and telling him\nYou gotta be careful what you're doing here and he ignored all of it\nListen graves level of determination terms of their actions here that's just astonishing\nI'm Talking to Greg Miller who's the author most recently The Apprentice let me ask you a question that has ... me and I I Do see it through a partisan lens but I I'm willing to say that of Republicans have broken the law if we're ... Republicans have done things that are not good for America than than they should be you know they should be appropriately punished\nFor it but here's the Russia collusion that I don't understand why it has become more of the public discussion and I have to think it's because of the mainstream media\nWe know that the Russian officials who told Christopher Steele a whole big pack of stories most of which turns out seemed to be\nUntrue unpredictable and almost ridiculous or in the Steele dossier he he is he puts together a document with information from Russian government officials for Hillary Clinton and the DNC had there'll be has and paid for by them\nWhich is then used in what could only be a an attempt to change the outcome of the election what other purpose would there be of trying to push this documented so many news people and it's so many officials\nIf not to change the outcome of the election when that didn't happen they used it to try to take apart the Trump presidency once the election was over\n... why isn't that seen as a collusion between the other side with Russian government officials true paid intermediaries to create a different outcome for the ...\nWell I think if you look at the you know what steel was hired to do and how he was hired and how he was not told who the client was and how initially fusion GPS has hired in fact by Republican or a neutral operatives to look at\nTrump and to sort of look into his background and then they turn and get funding from the Democrats only after\nAfter Trump is one of the primary and they think that they're on to such fascinating material they think somebody ought to be willing to pay for it and of course they do find that the DNC is willing to pay for it um but still you know as a by all accounts a pretty straight up\nA former British Intelligence official a nobody accuses him I don't think of things sort of a political hitman here and it's we don't know a whole lot yet about the sources of his material for the steel ... but I guess I Would argue that you know although some of it is unproven it certainly seems\nPlausible that Trump would be interacting it would be conducting themselves in in a Moscow that the way he conducted himself\nA a neutral operatives to look at\nTrump and his sort of look into his background and then they turn and get funding from the Democrats only after after Trump is one of the primary and they think that they're on to such fascinating material they think somebody ought to be willing to pay for it and of course they do find\nThat the DNC is willing to pay

don't know a whole lot yet about the sources\nOf his material for the Steele dossier but I guess I Would argue that you know although some of it is unproven it certainly seems\nPlausible that Trump would be interacting it would be conducting themselves in in a Moscow is the way he conducted himself in Lake Tahoe with Stormy Daniels I'm not sure why that would be so astonishing if that were to be true\nImmigrants who are here unlawfully and those numbers as they're padded um give them an easier way to relative to other just strict should be able to pass some of these policies or elected congressional members\nPractically mean the the representation of some people in this country is being diluted by the president so these are legals\nPulled out the entire debate our system is based on one person one vote and to the commentary as being written in these lawsuits are\nAre now being created it's a matter of challenging does this question of\nReally is a one person one vote when some districts have an easier way of passing things or electing representative because there are so many just qualified voters in their district\nLet me ask you a straight ahead a constitutional question since your constitutional attorney um are people who are here in the country illegally are they in title to representation in Congress would say you were in the state legislature\nUh even though they're here in the country illegally as is has there been a definitive answer to them\nNo uh and people will say yes there has about what they're doing is looking at a loss that that went to the Supreme Court where the Supreme Court looked at the issue of just strict day so that's a matter of how the lines are drawn and they said that these\nPeople count as far as the drawing of the lines but the question has never been answered when it comes to apportion that and that means how we figure out or the four hundred and thirty five\nCongressional districts and that's a fixed number so it's very much as there are some game and\nSo when it comes to those districts and how many people count in those districts and whether they are citizens and eligible to vote that question has never been answered and it does all go back to kind of an arcane issue because the fact that\nWhen our country was founded it was a matter of the state's looking at people who are eligible to vote in just different states we all have different policies back\nThen as to what was what a ... created eligibility and and the wording habits and which carried with it a legal status was used to qualify that people who were here and eligible to vote\nSo now it's a matter of looking back at that language in the original and ... and and understanding was that person and inhabitants when it came to the way that our founding fathers originally looked at\nThis um inhabitant meant somebody who was here lawfully and who was qualified to\nBut does it help moves will do that we now have another originalist thank God on the U.S Supreme Court to sing come record\nIt very well may help when it comes to exactly this kind of an issue which is what with we are interpreting our constitution and the way that it was meant to be interpreted in the spirit of the time and what the\nFounders intended and yet it than we are looking for people that would be faithful to that original and to\nRome looking forward to that who would have standing to bring peace in this I've only got about twenty seconds but how could somebody who will hit\nFears losing a seat and so there is a harmless demonstrable so states like Alabama where they're looking at the shift that has been happening and certainly as California picks up for other states\nThe court it very well now how when it comes to exactly this kind of an issue\nWhich is what we are interpreting our constitution and the way that it was meant to be interpreted in the spirit of the time and what the\nFounders intended and yet it than we are looking for people that would be faithful to that original and test\nWell I'm looking forward to that who would have standing to bring a case in this I've only got about twenty seconds but how could somebody go

Sarah are you there I Am okay thank you I go right ahead and ask Dr phil Ross are your concerns the modern era\nWhen I was actually calling like aren't they just perk you're talking about who really first I had for you was about the hype out\nOh you've you've hurt me in the past ... yeah okay if I tell you about that so [laughter] okay [laughter] yeah that was the one show wasn't it it was designed yeah well actually in the south I mean I did OK\nYeah put it on and I know you have to leave I thought that right away what's the uprising but then I have another question in regards to how it could actually help them up and I don't\nKnow that I Know that yeah the timing is perfect because we're talking about the neurology um and uh you know I appreciate it says that that you you called in today so the anti belt actually supports a ligaments on the backside of where you're glued saw some people called there but their muscles um\nAnd a disjointed can go on for let's say to do a standing position but it's also key and just doing slight bending forward motion such as doing dishes and vacuuming\nAnd when this thing gets damaged um it's very difficult to get a better without some assistance and so the outside bell\nActually is wrapped around the pelvis at a strategic traditional a place to help to heighten that thing up and over about six week period of time we find that people can do that that's going from it\nWhat's the uprising but then I haven't quite got how it actually helping or hurting\nYou know the yeah the timing is perfect because we're talking about the neurology um and ah you know I appreciate it says that that you you called in today so the ... actually supports a ligaments on the back right away you're glued saw some people called there but they're but muscles um\nAnd I just joined it can go on for them to say to do a standing position but it's also key and just doing slight bending forward motion such as doing dishes and vacuuming\nAnd when this thing gets damage um it's very difficult to get a better without some assistance and so the five bell\nActually is wrapped around the pelvis at a strategic traditional a place to help that heightened that thing up\nAnd over about six week period of time we find that people can do the test going from ... to do a standing position again without a problem now I've been doing that for almost Thirty years now 'cause I have that problem when I was thrown by a black belt in judo which I mentioned earlier on the show is going to talk a little bit about\nAnd I landed wrong and it was in practice and and after that I Am about two and a half months later I couldn't put your shoveled tried to get myself through pre med anymore\nAnd I ended up having to go on World Cup and I was six and a half percent body fat now if you saw me today you would say really\nBut I I was and I was in shape so it's not about being overweight folks being overweight is just carrying extra weight it's about the tone in the balance of the body and the neurological system functioning properly so when we take this felt CERN will use it\nWe actually can tighten up the or that area and over time the brain starts thinking oh this is the normal this is the norm on the best way for me to do people as you know a gymnast will stretch to become limber and that they don't stretch what ends up happening is that they tighten up\nAnd say I have to constantly stretch but when somebody like me you know lambs wrong or falls downstairs off of gasoline or picking something up\nAnd we we damaged that ligament when it's healing it's always stretching it's never type because we're trying to get in and out of cars getting up and down a off of chairs and helping kids and that kind of stuff and so it stays laps and stays stretched out\nThat belt actually changes it and it does a permanent correction and I'm a witness to this over Thirty years now what we're doing is when I talk about permanence you also talked about a high percentage of permanent the so now what we're doing is we're using regenerative meant a issue which we haven't talked about this morning but regenerative issue in those joints\nAnd that has the highest probability of being able to regenerate and restore back to normal so that we can take that take that joint in that issue and get it to be rebuilt and functioning properly again so there's only one way you are going to do\nA if you have this problem uh almost ten outta ten people there that\nCame to me at the show have an anti instability if they have chronic low back pain they can come in with hip pain and and find pain and ... but almost ten outta ten people\nThat go through this dance to actually fail it and those are the ones I Know within a short gee\nI can fix an emphatic and passionate about it because you all don't need to be suffering with low back pain that's something that I'm going to be teaching I'm hoping in Vegas through a bunch of doctors\nThat I even though I learnt from others I don't know if there's so many health care professionals that don't know how to do this just so if you have low back pain there or whether it's you or or friends or family out there is a community please call six zero to nine Ninety two to six five six\nGet your complimentary visit let me get this quick temps on you I can tell you immediately\nIf it is part of the issues you're having for low back pain and the second thing you're asking me if there was what second question\nThe question I think it's going to require\nAnd and supplying pain and ... but almost ten outta ten people\nThat go through this past actually fail it and those are the ones I Know within a short T\nI can fix an emphatic and passionate about it because you all don't need to be suffering with low back pain this was something that I'm going to be teaching I'm hoping in Vegas to a bunch of doctors\nThat I even though I learned from others I don't know if there's so many health care professionals that don't know how to do this just so if you have low back pain Sarah whether it's you or or friends or family out there or the community please call six zero to nine nine to two six five six\nGet your complimentary visit let me get this quick temps on you I can tell you immediately\nIf it is part of the issues you're having for low back pain and the second thing you're asking me if there was what second question\nAnd asked the question I think it's hard to recant it it it that's a problem that you're referring to\nUh yes it can be solved that found sales or what you're made of and we use antibiotics issue that have stem cells in it along with growth factors\nAnd we have found that the company we're using locally here has third party studies and and the highest viability of the issues that do the best job I've worked with quite a few labs\nAre and what I've learned as they're not all the same they don't have all the same processes and you you all have to make sure that you asked for certain things asked for the study is\nAsk if there's red blood cells are red blood cell particularly in this issue because the FDA actually states that you shouldn't be putting that\nIn your joints it's only to be used in other applications but the issues that we used don't have\nAnd so you don't have to worry about DNA getting in there\nAnd this it has the highest amount of\nI Want to say collective growth factors in stem cells that have given the maximum benefits over the last two years of me doing this\nOn the F ... joint knees hips shoulders I mean we've been doing hands and so when we talk about this this is rebuilding your body but when we talk about permanence these sanctions you sound like you're kind of combining that thought\nProcess that through your life with my pregnancy and and the use of that rock okay\nShe has a very active lifestyle and she likes to maintain that Dr ... okay [laughter]\nClimbing up on\nOh I'm like okay you know what this is the deal when it comes to surgery on these you've got to make it a point you got to get in let me take a look at that at least get a second opinion there's no commitment to come in accept your for your paying attention\nAnd just your time so that I can tell you what I think and if they're wanting to do surgery on you do everything you can to find a solution that you don't have to have that until the last resort I even have people come and join me right now that are bone on bone\nAnd if they're born on bones is themselves cannot go in and rebuild on something that's not their\nHowever what we're learning as people just don't want to have that surgery especially if you're forty or fifty or even six because once you have a surgery it's most likely you're going to have another one on a need within about ten years is my understanding\nAnd you can only have so many of those before it's not gonna work for you anymore so if you can avoid that that'd be based on what people are doing is they're using the embryonic issue and they're now incorporating across the United states P. R. P. which has played ... rich plasma that's drawn out of you\nThat's when the blood drawn out of you they spin it down in a centrifuge vending machine and they only take the growth factors out of you and they put it back in that helps to drive\nThemselves to do their job and also puts in their more college in and more protein to help rebuild that area so we have folks that we've been doing injections with bone on bone on and we're trying to do everything we can in order to help them avoid\nPeople just don't want to have that surgery especially if you're forty or fifty or even six because once you have a surgery it's most likely you're going to have another one on a need within about ten years is my understanding\nAnd you can only have so many of those before it's not gonna work for you anymore so if you can avoid that that'd be great to what people are doing is they're using the embryonic issue and they're now incorporating across the United states P. R. P. which has played ... rich plasma that's drawn out of you\nThat's when the blood drawn out of you they spin it down in a centrifuge vending machine and they only take the growth factors out of you and they put it back in that helps to drive\nThemselves to do their job and also puts in their more college in and more protein to help rebuild that area so we have folks that we've been doing injections with bone on bone on and we're trying to do everything we can in order to help them avoid\nSurgery sooner rather are avoided surgery sooner so they're gonna have it given the longest life span as they can do enjoy their active lifestyle because once they do is cut once they cut and they do surgery they can't don't cut\nAnd it's never going to be the same so if you can avoid that it is the smartest I in my opinion it's the wisest thing to do so I said if you don't have an appointment in the clinic please call and get one at six to nine nine to ... six five six and if we didn't have enough time to be able to talk about this that the show\nPlease and sign up tonight called a clinic tonight there sign up and uh see me tonight for the seminar we're going to be having the workshop\nAnd we're just we're going to go over this when they give you the pros and cons were going to give you the good the bad we're going to give you the laws in the FDA regulations will teach you how to find the right solution for you you have any other questions while you're on the phone with me\nIf I get them um how come before I go back for like tennis and\nThose are uh I only have a minute or so to answer that so let me be real brief everybody is different in nutrition matters your weight matters to damage if you just you matters is the very that's there what you do after that there's really no downside you can go ahead and\nDo your everyday activities of daily living you know bathing and going to you know a grocery shopping and stuff like that\nThen the next two weeks of monitoring regulate and get you back as soon as possible some people want to get back in the day after don't do it let me regulate and monitor what the experience that I have to get you the best benefits some people are you know six weeks some people are three months\nIt just depends on your condition thank you so much I appreciate the calls today and I hope that helps everybody out there who wanted to call in and out the same question\nYou know Dr ... is no hard core rehab correct\nNo there's no hard core rehab there is no you're laying in bed and now and we're not going to put you on a stretching machine and and and no pain no gain I don't believe in that as a sideline doctor for the Arizona football they for seven years and it's one of those that\nIf you're in pain we want to reduce that we want to get you better out of paying because when you have paying your body is telling you something could be wrong and we don't want you to exacerbate that\nThat if you're in pain we want to reduce that we want to get you better out of pain because when you have in your body is telling you something could be wrong and we don't want you to exacerbate that\nNormal for me and I I don't have any more pain in there but I wanted to I'm bringing into the car crash thing right so look if you've got a car crash your elbows in shoulders knees and how about if you're holding onto the steering wheel\nI Know a gal I Love her dearly she's my wife\nAnd she was holding onto this genuine when she got in a car crash before we met and she was a massage therapist probably the best I've ever known and her\nCould no longer get you know the muscle tissue was awful okay and so\nYou look don't don't just think it's a whiplash situation or a headache situation when you go to the doctor to get checked out I mean the chiropractor the by all mechanical expert I Want you to really tell them all the things that are wrong with you not just your neck because they are educated in the whole\nAnd if they need to send you to a medical doctor for medicine or something like that a surgeon you know they're qualified to do that as well the one I liked it kind of turned that into a conversation about a gentleman that came in recently and\nHe was really having a lot of hip pain in this other had been\nAlready surgically replaced okay and this wasn't a very old man I mean he wasn't in the seventies or eighties\nAnd he didn't want to have a hip replacement on the other one\nOkay and so with that hit the on the other side\nI said look I Need to see an MRI hips are very complicated there's a lot of muscle tissue in there I can test it all I Want but I really don't have extra vision I'm not Superman regardless of what this s on my shirt says Hi I [noise] um but you know so we did an MRI and the results came back to the other day\nAnd I learned that there was a previous\nMRI that have been done about four years ago okay and the results on their said he had mild to moderate arthritis he had mild bone spurs which of those little things that stick out because of a malfunction over time that the body creates as an adapter process and that it really was still had joint space in there and the cartilage was good\nAnd I looked at the MRI he just did recently four years later\nAnd it made me sick to my stomach I just I I I I really did um and what ended up happening was over time he didn't take care of it with that said that he was with necessary by all mechanical corrections is my guest or maybe didn't go to the right doctors\nBut now his MRI that he had severe arthritis in severe bone spurs and he had bone on bone and the bone on bonus\nPrevious MRI that have been done about four years ago okay and the results on their said he hadn't mild to moderate arthritis he had mild bone spurs which of those little things that stick out because of a malfunction over time that the body creates as an adapter process okay\nAnd that it really was a joint space in there and the cartilage was good\nAnd I looked at the MRI he just did recently four years later\nAnd it made me sick to my stomach I just I I I I really did um and what ended up happening was over time he\nDidn't take care of it is with that said that he was with necessary by all mechanical corrections is my guest or maybe didn't go to the right doctors but now his MRI said he had severe arthritis in severe bone spurs\nAnd he had bone on bone and the bone on bone is what made me sick because I Know when we deal with bone on bone I Am limited at how well I can get people now we can help them we're gonna be able to help them All right but\nNot as much as if he had come in when he first felt the discomfort maybe four years ago\nA lot of people out there Dr frost are are going to the drugstore getting medication to treat the symptoms when they get aches and pains and they do that in many cases for months or in some cases years and that causes them to become\nThe stain in sickness I Want to say that again to stand in sickness and taking medication causes more ... than the condition needs to be addressed right away before absolutely before continue to get worse\nAnd it does it gets worse over time folks look five dangerous words in the English language quote me and everybody ever say to me\nMaybe it will go away I guess in the you know maybe the symptoms will go

I think you have a comment to share with the audience as well\nWell we have um [noise] let's go back to the woman's health expo a Dr frost because there's so many things that you maybe had touched down with some of the people that visited your booth and one of those things would be hormone yeah and then how does hormones relate to weight loss can you tell us a correlation there\nWhile my goodness so you're when you're a complete whole being we don't just focus on one thing and that was like one thing that I kept telling the patient you know they would come up to me and say well I'm going to be getting you know cord blood stem cells in my hip for ... I'm going to get surgery or\nI Need to lose weight what should I Do and a lot of people have opinions and and opinions are good as long as you collectively gather the information\nAnd explain to you what's really going on before you develop beyond that stage where you can't be helped naturally and I'll tell you what a cherry I think you have a comment to share with the audience as well\nWell we have um [noise] just go back to the woman's health expo a Dr frost because there's so many things that you maybe had touched down with some of the people that visited your booth and one of those things would be hormone yeah and then how does hormones relate to weight loss can you tell us a correlation there\nWhile my goodness so you're when you're a complete whole being we don't just focus on one thing and that was like one thing that I kept telling the patient you know they would come up to me and say well I'm going to be getting you know cord blood stem cells in my hip for ... I'm I'm going to get surgery or\nI Need to lose weight what should I Do and a lot of people have opinions and anti opinions are good as long as you collectively gather the information\nAnd take that council and find the food down there um but with him and women's health expo at the hormones I got a lot of questions about balancing out hormones and do we do that in the clinic and we do and Dr Miller is is a phenomenal\nA clinician my nature path the medical doctors work with me for two years now about balancing hormones and\nWhen we talk about hormones which can also talk about the weight loss as you were asking these all go together and then when we talk about the weight loss we talk about the knees and hips and the vial mechanical stresses so let's start with\nThe most important things in our logical system first of all you want to make sure that's functioning properly so your organs get and your endocrine system which is your uh\nYour organs that actually produce hormones such as your adrenal pituitary\nGland et cetera thyroid you want to make sure the nervous system is communicating properties of the brain in the body can talk to each other right otherwise it's going to be misinformation and they're not going to function right number one number two\nAh we gotta do blood tests we we can't gas well we can guess we don't want to hear about what's going on in the blood is right but if we do proper blood testing and I the proper let me say\nCapital P. um proper blood testing\nYou've got to have the right person reading it so when you guys go and get blood testing from an endocrinologist that's that's the hormone doctor\nThat they don't always use all of a hormone testing that's the day to find out how your adrenal are doing in a relationship to your thyroid and draw the complete picture with Dr Miller is able to do that so when you deal with hormones you have to deal with thyroid and sleep cycles and that she can\nIf we can balance those out it's going to be a lot easier to lose weight\nWe can get on a diet all day all week all year long we can change our foods we can run I Know you've done it for years and still don't lose that weight right\nOftentimes it has to do with the chemistry not balanced properly and trying to respond to all their efforts\nAnd that's gotta be frustrating that every absolutely I mean I like you know trying to gain muscle mass you in the gym every day but you're the same size every day that's right you know for years and and and that would just that could be really discouraging so we want to take the discouragement yeah out of the equation by going after the hormones\nYou're getting the facts you're solving the case right absolutely getting right to the ... the problem you've got to hand physicians and clinicians\nAnd a team of doctors that work together for a for your common goal and that's why when you come into the clinic and I sit down with you we do a thirty minute consultation an examination on that area\nAnd we find out what your goal is and then I give you the targeted solutions and steps over the\nThat's a women's health expo I had constantly women asking me for the end result give me the heart give me what the bag you know I don't like that was all good and fine but I said look I look\nI work in boxes yeah I'm a man [laughter] and I work in boxes so look my ... starts with come in let's find out what's going on the next box is what's the next step the next box as well\nSo we want to take the discouragement yeah out of the equation by going after the hormones\nYou're getting the facts you're solving the case right\nAbsolutely getting right to the common problem you've got to hand physicians and clinicians and a team of doctors that work together for a for your common goal and that's why when you come into the clinic and I sit down with you we do a thirty minute consultation and examination on that area\nAnd we find out what your goal is and then I give you the targeted solutions and steps over the\nThat's a women's health expo I had constantly women asking me for the end result give me the cart give me what the bag you know I I don't like that was all good and fine but I said look I look\nI work in boxes yeah I'm a man [laughter] and I work in boxes so look my box starts with come in and let's find out what's going on the next box is what's the next step the next boxers what were the result the next box is\nWhat's the plan of attack right let's solutions and the most important is\nHow do you want to handle it so in my clinic\nWe just want to give you the solutions that allow you the freedom to be able to decide how you want to fix you and get your life by\nThen you need to have your patients uh have compliance too and that right Dr frost\nAsked her about that a little bit yeah you know one of the things that I won't tell you I Will not accept you as a patient if we cannot agree on the work that's going to take to get the results that you want I have patients who want to build a Ferrari and they want a Ferrari might then you got to work for a Ferrari and that's no problem\nAnd I'll tell you if we are going to give you a Nineteen sixty three for more we're going to give you on a two thousand and eight teams for arrives right you know some things change to the point that we actually can't get you back to a two thousand and eight teams that get the Nineteen sixty three raised in the track against against other nights you take the three ... are you going\nTo happen but if you if you're gonna work for a

good\nAnyway so um\nWe talk a little bit and then I was going over with the young person yesterday about trading talk to them last night again about trading so we're going over a strategy now by the way here's my disclaimer I'm not as a financial advisor we don't have a theory six or seven white and we don't I don't do any of that security is we're not doing security\nSeriously this is so easy anybody can do this okay\nThere is no such thing my mother used to tell me that is all the time there's no such thing as getting rich quick\nThen she would say listen this eighty Biddy ... unless if you position\nYourself right his timing is rarely perfect you position yourself right that you could get wealthy really fast\nIt's MORNING it's all good anyway\nSo um we talk a little bit and then I was going over with a young person yesterday about trading talk to them last night again\nAbout trading so we're going over a strategy now by the way here's my disclaimer I'm not as a financial advisor we don't have a serious six or seven licence we don't I don't do any of that security is we're not doing security is\nSeriously this is so easy anybody can do this okay\nThere's no such thing my mother used to tell me this all the time there's no such thing as getting rich quick\nThen she would say listen this eighty Biddy ... ... less if you\nPosition yourself right his timing is rarely perfect if you position yourself right that you can get wealthy really fast okay you got to pay attention so that I was talking yesterday and I've been talking about it for a while\nAbout the first phase of buyers are the bitcoin like myself early on when it was pennies that phase is over now we're at a new face this is the buyer investor type base where you buy it and hold it hold links days\nH. O. D. L. E. R. H. O. D. L. are ... or ... or ... is the whole Earth Day why do you want to hold\nAll [laughter] this is I had a guy last night he uh when I was telling them about and I got a call coming up with a professional athlete right after the show about why would you hold something that has the potential to reach a trillion\nTrillion want to say that again a trillion let's do the math yeah All right so in our world\nEconomy two hundred and eighty three hundred trillion a year but the the ... on trillion with a T\nH bitcoin one bitcoin I'm writing this down as you're riding one bitcoin as one hundred million into CNN one hundred million so Toshi okay it has one million bet\nSo there's one million bit there's a hundreds of Toshi her bed one hundred million and Toshi so let's just talk about the bit so the beginning potential the beginning\nPotential and this is why it's a store value is if you don't sleep tonight you can blame it on the fat little Indian blame it on me it's okay to big shelters [laughter] I listen one million ballots per bitcoin\n... so the potential values a hundred million to start the price today that sixty five hundred and Seventy ... went up a little bit sixty five Seventy two somebody fix that happened you guys need to get religion or whatever you wanna do pay attention it's been straight across the board moving a hundred two hundred dollars one way or the other but very little movement\nGame at sixty five hundred dollar mark for two weeks now something's gonna happen I'm is we're gonna take a big debt or it's gonna bump so you want to be a strategically ready or liquid in either case if it goes down you want to incrementally by as it goes down\nAnd uh if it goes up you still want to buy you want to buy is always it's okay to buy at the high but listen you've got one million bits and the bitcoin so the potential for the the first one of the first potentials is one million\nDollars per bet when you break it down person tells you one hundred million ... would you be one hundred million dollars which is the next potential value of the bitcoin\nFrom their ... this is where it gets crazy [noise]\nThe other but very little movement game at sixty five hundred dollar mark for two weeks now something's gonna happen I'm is we're gonna take a big debt or it's going to bump so you want to be a strategically ready or liquid in either case if it goes down you want to incrementally by as it goes down\nAnd uh if it goes up you still want to buy you want to buy is always it's okay to buy at the high but listen you've got one million bits and the bitcoin so the potential for the the first one of the first potentials is one million\nDollars per bet when you break it down person tells you one hundred million ... would you be one hundred million dollars which is the next potential value of the bitcoin\nFrom their neck ... this is where it gets crazy [noise]\nWe're not going to talk much about inflation but those if you want to we can go there lighter path to pay grade of what I Want to talk about now\nLet's talk about deflation what causes deflation deflation is when there's no inflation so it's the opposite of inflation will leave the inflation offer now so that deflation part here there's no extra cost to the value\nSo those are the value of their listen to invest those you buy you ... out there and those of you who pay attention to your own portfolios and those of you listening to music or art savvy at buying or investing do yourself the biggest favor the world go by some\nYour forget her on but for the rest of us this is why this is important because some of you are on the fence a lot of you and most of them you don't even know what it is but some of your on the fence lake ... give me a swift kick in the you know where you're sitting\nIn knock you out the fans 'cause I Want to move you over to the other side the crypto side so here\nThe more money that is put into that coin though more valuable that one corn becomes let's just take one coin they're Twenty one million bitcoins ever going to be mined out there that's it Twenty one million\nBut here's the big deal out of all of this when you say look at the big picture\nOne of the big one of the potential is after bitcoin reaches that one hundred million for coin then it can be ... broken down into a tear up by\nA terabytes is one trillion so in one bitcoin there's one point let me see if I can give this up here right make sure I got it right\nThere one point two five eight to five write that down one million berets or one bitcoin equals one point two five eight to five Tara by one point two five ...\nBy Kay One point two five tear up by a terabytes is a trillion so instead of inflating it we're going to be played it and you divide it out so every four years old boy this gets exciting\nFour years bitcoin is not going to split have you had any er an apple you remember when it split then you've got two of them here it is desert split but it does what's called\nHaving had it you cut it in half and the having\nPart means that it becomes fifty percent more difficult to mine it which means what if you got something that was fifty percent harder to get more difficult to obtain then it was\nYesterday and it's never going back to yesterday ever it's never going back 'cause it had which means it's going to make it fifty percent more difficult to mine it it's going to make it more valuable so you put more money into that coin the value of that coin\nSo every four years hopefully this gets exciting every four years bitcoin is not going to split have you had any er an apple you remember when it split then you've got two of 'em here is desert split but it does what's called\nHaving had it ... you cut it in half\nThe having part means that it becomes fifty percent more difficult to mine it which means what if you got something that was fifty percent harder to get more difficult to obtain then it was yesterday\nIt's never going back to yesterday ever it's never going back 'cause it had which means you're going to make it fifty percent more difficult to mine it it's going to make it more valuable so you put more money into that coin the value of that coin goes up\nThe value of that coin goes up whatever dollars this is why I Can't wait till after the elections are over and and I've got a lot of stuff I've sent the securities and exchange treasury\nEt cetera they are asked the White House on my own ideas of how I Believe we can roll this out pay off our debt we can pay up at twenty trillion dollar debt and a couple of years I got a plan for it and I know what a work it\n... and it's all done through deflation and building a store a value to the bitcoin so the more money that goes in that bitcoin the more the value of that house becomes because it doesn't go anywhere and from in the here get this\nSo it doesn't you don't need more to make the value to pay the value you just divided\nAnd as you divided the more money you put in it the more you're able to divide isn't that something but the values still stays in that store\nIncredible what's gonna happen here\nCan you imagine having a truly is going to be the biggest shipped in wealth in history the biggest shipped in wealth in human history the biggest shift in wealth in human history for a zero\nFor six six one zero nine states this is why Mackey D's over those years joining me for the first time for a zero [laughter]\nFor eight zero for six six one zero nine six coming soon wacky dot com you can always go to be I teach the that bravo

C.\nTwenty one to one dot com that's aligning page\nI got other pages coming but you can look at all the stuff that's put out there by the treasury\nI have it on my landing page I had a bad asked me the other day and asked me\nSome questions I said why didn't you just say you were from the feds or just checking out [laughter]\nTalk to you guys all the time you don't have to be secretive about it [laughter] it was all good it was a good is good conversation anyway I'm just saying you've got to be about a minute we're going out to the bottom half of the hour\nI who do we have on the show after today generally give them a shout out today we got somebody successful aging signal successful aging I should know that by now we had him on the show I Love to give them back on the show again that was a great conversation that we had successful aging okay but\nAnyway we're right zero for six six one zero nine six you want to go in and rate up pay attention could you imagine\nThe more that money that goes into it the more the value it is and then you can just come and you can continue to fraction it out could you imagine listen to this two hundred and eighty three hundred trillion dollars runs the world a year worldwide\nSo after today generally give them a shout out today we got somebody successful aging ... successful I actually know that by now we had him on the show I'd love to get them back on the show again that was a great conversation that we have access to like OK\nBut anyway we're right zero for six six one zero and I think you want to go in and rate up pay attention could you imagine\nThe more that money that goes into it the more the value it is and then you can just can you can continue to fraction it out did you manage and listen to this two hundred and eighty three hundred trillion dollars runs the world a year\nAnd I just wait it out because it's\nDeflation airy so down the road every four years and I'm the only I was the very first crypto currency show bitcoin show in in America there's a whole bunch of now they ... they go down faster than they come up but we have some credibility\nWe've already been through some past with the beds were still around and we're baby business I mean literally a year in this business is like a decade that's what they're equating it to\nA year in this business like a decade in the stock market businesses just it's craziness it it's so good it moves so fast you got to be paying attention by the way we got some breaking news today I'm going to get to that but let me finish this part because it's so important I'm so glad I get a lot of calls valley\nI get a lot of calls and a lot of text messages a lot of emails every day and\nYou know I've seen this call come in and it went past the people who are looking at it and he got forwarded to me I see in command I'm like okay well with a forty let me look at it and I was listening to it as a man that is such a beautiful story I mean it really is\nToday though if you will position yourself because listen to every four years here's what happened Sally can tell us your grandkids hope they're listening to the show if not you can go back to eleven hundred\nK. F. in X. K. F. the letter\nIn like Nancy X. dot com click on podcast and you'll find the fly Mackey showing go back and listen to the show but every four years bitcoin as I was talking earlier when they mind that on the Internet it's digital\nSo you don't have to print it it gets mind how does mining work in mind when you do a transaction transactions done\nCauses the ... going to be mind here's what happens every four years it's going to split so to speak or half\nIn difficulty to get that coin\nImagine now just imagine a bit stuck at sixty five hundred and four years from now and they have when it has if it's twice as hard to get the the rationale is and this is a economics one on one\nK. F. the letter in like Nancy X. dot com click on podcasts and you'll find the fly Mackey showing go back and listen to the show but every four years bitcoin as I was talking earlier when they mind it on the Internet it's digital\nSo you don't have to print it it gets mind how does mining work in mind when you do a transaction transactions done it causes the ... going to be mind here's what happens every four years it's going to split so to speak or half\nIn difficulty to get that coin\nSo imagine now just imagine a bit stuck at sixty five hundred and four years from now and they have when it has if it's twice as hard to get the the rationale is and this is a economics one on one\nAnd I'm not an econ major I'm not a finance guy but I manage my own money but any finance guy will tell you if it's twice as hard to get there is a good chance the price is going to\nDouble and that would be like a minimum a double\nOn a minimum it's a no brainer twice starting to get I'm charging twice as much for it so you'd be looking at Thirteen thousand for the coin four years later what would that turned to Thirteen thousand twenty six thousand\nDo the math for years later so now we're talking twelve years later twenty six thousand that's fifty two thousand a coin that's in twelve years if it just has and continues on that price of having the doubling the money because it's not inflationary not printing more you're just dividing it out\nSo the more money that's put into that bitcoin imagine this sound like you're gonna wake up some day in your grandkids and great great great grandkids and great pass the time that you're onto the next world living with baby Jesus and the angels up there\nI Can't wait for that day I Hope I'm going I'm sure believing I Am but I can tell you this the day that you and I are long gone forty fifty a hundred years from now\nImagine the legacy you can leave when somebody wakes up and go you know what I think I'm gonna buy some grandma Sally bitcoin today yeah let's go let's get some of that today\nOr their relatives or their friends are the people in church or their people they know cetera list let's get this hunting turn to their wife or turned her husband hunting let's get some let's get some Sally bitcoin today\nBecause that's what happens is the more money that's put into the coin the more valuable it doesn't lose the dollars once it split it becomes more valuable in that crazy and here's a good thing about it I'm not talking about splitting once\nIt has become more difficult to get it becomes more valuable when you put the money in its automatic economics one oh one it doubles in the price minimum okay here's what's happening\nThen you could incrementally break it down and I I moved it passed a hundred million point to the trillion I had some people that could not sleep yeah the guy could not sleep he could not sleep I said stop bugging me [laughter]\nAbout by getting me to come on\nIts future potential but when you could break down one bitcoin one million beds one hundred million to Toshi into digits one Tara by\nOne point two trillion per bitcoin\nThere's Twenty one million bitcoins we only need three hundred of the bitcoins we only need three hundred to match the world economy now is it going to do away with money no\nIs it going to do away with dollars in court no that's going to be around probably forever and I hope so you need the two to balance out those of you are afraid that it's going to take a no\nGet past the hundred million point to the trillion I had some people they could not sleep yeah the guy could not sleep he could not sleep I said stop bugging me [laughter]\nNot by getting me to come on its future potential but when you could break down one bitcoin one million bet one hundred million to Toshi into digits one Tara by\nOne point two trillion per bitcoin\nThey're Twenty one million bitcoins we only need three hundred of the bitcoins when we need three hundred to match

those if you are afraid that it's going to take a no it's going to balance it out\nIt's like the credit and debit why do you have a credit why do you use the debit Wilson alternative to holding the cash in hand it's safer it's easier to use its quicker\nI could go on and on about that I don't think the odds ever going to go away and I hope it doesn't help it sticks around forever this right over

Patterson and the subject of antibiotic stewardship\nDr ... before the break we were talking\nAbout aging well in business doctors and pushing back you know asking questions\nDuring the break we talked about you know sometimes we used the patients we think that physicians are daughter next to God or or somewhere on the train just see God or something okay and um so we're kind of reluctant to you know to you know to question but he said some interesting things about\nThe the patient from a position relationship and how doctors really want to see like informed patient when you talk about that a couple of minutes but pushing back gently without getting thrown to the office\nWell you know the first thing I Want to see as part of the the myth we want to continue\nWe're talking with Dr ... Patterson and the subject of antibiotics stewardship\nThat compete before the break we were talking about um aging well in the business of doctors and pushing back you know asking questions\nDuring the break we'll talk about you know sometimes we use this patient's we think that physicians are God or next to God or or somewhere on the train to see God or something okay and um so we're kind of reluctant to you know to you know to question but he says some interesting things about\nThe patient I'm a physician relationship and how doctors we want to the lake uniform patients he talked about that a couple minutes but pushing back gently without getting thrown to the office\nWell you know the first thing I wanted to say is part of the ... the myth we want to continue all\nGood [laughter] so we want to get rid of that one [laughter]\nI get better early in the\nDays worlds or you know an informed patient is a good patient absolutely and that's and and the physicians nurses anybody in who does healthcare for Libyan really wants to have people that are\nVery well informed and and uh wanting to ask ask questions and ... things explain to them that well this is all all to the good and and people shouldn't feel that that they're making their positions uncomfortable or doing something that's\nAh against the grain very much with the green today I Would say\nI think too that um\nYou know you said earlier you get our bodies are temple and that kind of thing and being in touch with our body is I think as a physician they would want to have a patient that really understand what's going on and listened to what's going on in their body\nAs opposed to someone that just has absolutely no idea and you know whatever they're told they take as thoughtful kind of thing so\nExactly and it's it's a it's a learning thing you know like the uh for myself for example when I go to the gym a couple of times a week or two times a week now and a ... I always do a little routine when I'm going out there where I live my body said thank [laughter]\nReally I mean I spend\nTime with the ... you know EDS now I'm\nMuch more sensitive to overeating when I Do and I can you know immediate ... yeah and and and so I don't overeat or as much that you know a carelessly like insensitive ...\nRight like what's going on and that has that did that eating peace not doesn't apply just overeating also placed the quality of the things that you eat in order for you know home when we become\nSeems to be we ... eat a lot of fish right right and so like all of a sudden we don't have fish one day he said let's have we have a bad hamburger or something man you buddy screen that you know it really does fairly\nI asked about this labs just confession time last that was ... my wife and I had some bread sticks uh-huh like a like a the yeah the uh\nThe hot ones mhm and uh right away and when we were leaving I said you know I shouldn't have done\nThat [laughter] that's a good sign your in your body and it's all about you in touch with your body yeah and if you started doing the right things then when you do something wrong you buddy does talk to you then you better listen while you're able to listen to your ... your your ears are open\nEye or they weren't lately agree so just came back for a second to the antibiotics and last time we were talking about um people becoming resistant to antibiotics and it's still on the rise\n[laughter] you know it really does fairly\nI asked about this last just confession time out in science diet [laughter] last that ... that my wife and I had some bread sticks like a like a ... the yeah the uh the hot one mhm\nAnd uh right away when we were leaving I said you know I shouldn't have\nDone that [laughter] that's a good sign your in your body on the ... and it's all about you in touch with your body yeah and if you start doing the right things then when you do something wrong you buddy does talk\nTo you guys and then you better listen while you're able to listen yeah you're able to live your your ears are open\nYeah I think we agree so just came back for a second that antibiotics and last time we were talking about people becoming resistant to antibiotics and it's still on the rise or do you feel like it or making an impact\nWell we're making some impact and the ... ... ... antibiotic resistance is is still widespread in\nAnd one of the the myths about that really is that people become resistant to antibiotics which is not true it's the organisms that we all carry you know when you may know were seriously numbered by the bugs [laughter] you know we have five or ten times more\nBacterial cells in and on our bodies than human cells so were you know and just those resident bacteria you know the ... micro biome is the technical term mhm that become resistant after multiple courses of antibiotics so that's where the where the resistance it it's in the organ\nIn your area they become immune to what we have really feeling a little bit later\nThe good news about that is if you stop the repeated cycles of you know maybe a new antibiotics that that will a resistance will unwind\nYou that's the game I'm In I mean that's been my life is about Rudy is have you on the end we as a people as a human race ... need to get that lesson we need to start thinking about antibiotics differently than we then our culture\nTrained us like we aren't into something all of us here yes we were born into that we didn't invented ... you know so\nNow you're a perpetuated it we have yeah that's that's exactly right and then it seems like what's happened is our generation we come said we\nCome they become it's become such a fast world for us we want a fast fix okay yeah I remember growing up I didn't have a TV and you know so everything was it's kind of slow down now certainly speed it up\nAnd you wanted to get better as speed it up to right yes yeah yeah exactly\nAs you know in New ways of thinking then we need to learn\nOr the the best way that we used to think is that if you had a upper respiratory infection which is a low a viral illness yeah not a bacterial Dell has that taken an antibiotic will somehow delay or or make recovery faster is not true\nSo why did was some physicians to prescribe something for just to make you think better don't well I think you'd\nDo we have to appreciate that physicians are just like all of us or in the same culture ... you know\nWe were all trained that way right or you're exactly right and we were trained\nThat way and you know so it's not like they're doing something wrong about that when I tell people all the time it's not wrong\nWe just were trained that way now we have to you and in light of new knowledge and the situation that we're in which is we're at the edge of the clip hello if we go over the cliff into the post antibiotic era where you have no effective antibiotics it'll be hard to do the kind of modern medicine that we do mhm\nYou know you bring up an excellent point and it raises the question you talked about and I appreciate first of all it is good\nThere was some physicians to prescribe something for just to make you think better the old\nWell I think you'd do we have to appreciate that physicians are just like all of us or in the same culture ... you know we were all trained that way ... you're exactly right and we were trained that way and you know\nSo it's not like they're doing something wrong about that when I tell people all the time it's not wrong\nWe just were trained that way now we have to in light of new knowledge and the situation that we're in which is we're at the edge of the clip pillow if we go over the cliff into the post antibiotic era where you have no effective antibiotics it'll be hard to do the kind of modern medicine that we do mhm\nSo you know you bring up an excellent point and it raises the question you talked about and I appreciate first of all it is good for us to remember that physicians are just like we are yeah they are part of the same culture right right so did I did and you talked about retraining are we thinking issues\nAs part of that that that's not what I'm assuming that's not what they're taught in medical school but someone when they get out in the real world with patients said that the culture these kind of catch up to the ... is that a good assumption or not ...\nWell the the teachers in medical yeah who are in the culture to culture to that though I mean like it's been a tradition I mean when I was being trained I mean\nWhat else [laughter] well that long [laughter]\nYou know if it was the mark of a good clinician how quickly you could sniff out the earliest manifestations of infection yet that patients are by mhm okay I think that's part of what leads to get it early will get it early you know it's it's all part of what we need to rethink now\n... because those kinds of what opera waves of operating just won't get us out of the kind of ... now close to the edge of the cliff we get to move back from the edge of the ... rethinking how we deal with common situation\nI agree yeah I think how many friends that we have or people that we now especially in this industry and working like you just said a minute ago John that you know they'll just walk right in and say I need you pack your you know I I got to get\nMy dog when rioting\nAnd you know I ...\nI had to get over that I've got stuff I got to do and so they just go in and think you know they they can ask for and lots of time like Johns I thank God I found\nThat brings me actually the next question so since your last on the show what has happened in in our world in terms in the arena of maintaining and restoring the power of antibiotics\nWell of course that's the game of antibiotic stewardship to restore power as a friend of mine said at a meeting not too long ago make antibiotics great again\n[laughter] presidential candidate by by\nThe end of the room up as you said that [laughter]\nSo uh the fact is antibiotic stewardship now as a those programs are extended to really all domains of care now mhm uh started with an acute care are now in post acute care where where I Do most of my work mhm and are now out patient and doctors' offices have\nAn antibiotic stewardship programs in right behind that will be some regulations that like the\nStewardship programs are now required by federal state regulations in acute care mhm and a post acute care not yet in a lot of the doctor's offices but soon to come it's a different kind of place to try and regulate things right\nSo in addition to that there's all kinds of the national and a multinational alliances now between governments and professional organizations that are promoting stewardship and combating widespread antibiotic resistance\nYou know because you you if you're the government and ... in Norway the entire body of physicians or nurses by its big trouble for it yeah it's very political view it is it so\nYou say that as a group cloud is that when you try to say well you know they have to float\nThrough their patients like when managed care was a big thing ... you know bigger than it is today right\nIf they were the people were talking about how a it's a good thing that some physicians' offices are underwater you know financially it's the truth and then what then to push back\nCame from the patients you know who said that their representatives said look you know we can't have this ... you know you can't have a physician's underwater financially you know from\nRight you're right but I think it points a good point I think there's a great distinction to make is that did you see your physician they can only prescribe what's the if the if if he is approved anyway right right but in in ... in places where there's regulatory issues such as group homes and assisted living long term care\nThere there are compliance issues so that we have to monitor everything that is given so if you're over doing something or doing a desperate compliance comes in right yeah if you're a wise dad get in eighty seven pills a day here right or what's going on here he's walking like zombie\nRight exactly yeah and ... ... because of the regular regulations and long term care for example facilities have to employ one or more people whose job it is\nTo monitor compliance and pretty soon that starts to go through the whole organizational culture in a way that that leads to you know\nComplying with the regulations were done right you know instead of seeing the bigger picture that Rudy satisfaction resident family satisfaction his the big game\nAnd that's mine too I mean you gotta be compliance with regulatory but also residents satisfaction families right um 'cause every one is that everyone has their own physician\nThe thing that is given so if you're over doing something you're doing a desperate compliance comes in right yeah if you're a wise dad get in eighty seven pills a day here right or what's going on here he's walking like zombie\nRight exactly yeah and ... ... because of the regular regulations and long term care for example facilities have to employ one or more people whose job it is\nTo monitor compliance and pretty soon that starts to go through the whole organizational culture in a way that that leads to you know\nComplying with the regulations were done right you know they're seeing the bigger picture that Rudy satisfaction resident family satisfaction his the big game\nYeah and that's mine too I mean you gotta be compliance with regulatory but also resident satisfaction and families right um because everyone is everyone has their own physician al ... Web MD right\nThey can [laughter] sign [laughter]\nYeah well that I I think of it as they get to ask better questions you had guys from doing that kind of research yeah it's not like they become their own doctor now there's a saying or the person who ... his own lawyer has a pool or client\n[laughter] it seems to\nMe I Know a lot of families that seem to have gotten that informal degree yeah um\nBut that's a brief ... actually the next question is who you talk to the Internet and getting information off the Internet them before fan for me but what other kind of what kind of news stories publication other media communication exist only available to help people understand the importance of this whole antibiotics stewardship presidents ... topic\nWell as the first thing is is a lot of news stories you know a boat or antibiotic resistance and individual patients you know who had an illness that couldn't be treated in either became very ill or died because they couldn't find an antibiotic victims so there's plenty of those new stories around\nExcuse me is that a quiz that wasn't ... interesting point if somebody died because they couldn't find antibiotic is that it has that ever somehow been scientifically related back to this whole over dependence ... antibiotics in general so there there's nothing new that can replace something that somebody else has become immune to\nWell of course that part of it doesn't appear in the news story ... that's the that the the story behind the short answer would be that in the cases in pretty much every case that's been reported to someone who died because they had an infection with an organism that couldn't be treated with any known antibiotic\nIf you go back in the story a little bit you'll find that I guess what\nThey've been on antibiotics and having multiple courses ... right now they're ... and so they have resistant organisms that when they cause most infections that we get come from organisms we already have ... in our residents Laura they don't like come from outer space ... you know really the air\n[laughter] really I don't know that [laughter] that\nCome from first they're part of our resident organisms and then you know one thing or another happens and uh you know put a hole in the patient that's a good one you know surgery you know I don't but a whole page and then you get bacteria you know coming into the wound that kind of thing that's where it would actually come from\nSo so that's an example of of uh how you get into the situation of of multiple resistance there is a really good article that people can Google or in the New York times called tending the bodies microbial garden\nWhich is really all about the over seriously out numbered by the bugs mhm and we're learning there's this is the same techniques that unwound the human genome are now being a done to microorganisms called the micro biome project as a post\nPatterson unnecessary chicken antibiotic stewardship H in you know one of them\n\nAre you or someone you know in search of high quality senior services didn't do delay contact today at sixty three Ninety three Ninety nine four Seventy five Blue Cross the finish this you are you in with independent or assisted living healthy as well as nursing and don't we called cross your living today\nAt sixty three Ninety nine Ninety four Seventy five or ... online it ducked G.

can't be civil she's telling people to not be civil\nThat remember how mad people got at me when I did a show promo and I used in our glass to know when the show would start and how everyone including the New York times and Clinton surrogate screech from the rafters oh my gosh it's so violent\nHere she's telling people to stop being civil with other individual simply because they think differently from them and yet that's not a call the violence Maxine Waters isn't a call the violence I mean if you really want to have that conversation\n\nI just think that's incredibly irresponsible you cannot be civil with the political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\nShe's\nEverything that she everything that she does and everything and what she believes it's completely manufactured because see she says that since she cops this attitude after the fact Hillary Clinton is always a day late in the dollar short I mean days late last month's deadly\nBut now now she's copy nuts I just find that fascinating\nI mean it's just it's just manufactured in Seoul is you can't be civil with people well your party has already stopped being civil they've been doing that ... that that's been happening for a long time\nI I I Do think it's it's really\nFunny that she's saying that she's looking at what her party is doing and she's trying to speak to them in a way to still remain relevant because of the base of the Democrat Party they believe in these tactics as a way to campaign they believe in these tactics as a way\nTo um to to\nTry to when when they lose at the ballot box let me share with you this headline\nThis is from Robert Costa over Washington Post I find it really funny it says an angry mob Republicans work to recast democratic protest I out of control anarchy\nSo this column in order to be honest would have to ignore all of the antifa violence and all of the other progressive protests and all of the stuff from this weekend they would have to do all of that\nUm Republicans don't have to work to recast Democrat protests as anything I've you know I think burning buildings in punching people in the face and doing all of that stuff they do a good enough job of that they're by themselves\n\nTo win when they lose at the ballot box let me share with you this headline this is from Robert Costa over Washington Post I\nFind it really funny it says an angry mob Republicans work to recast democratic protest I out of control anarchy\nSo this column in order to be honest would have to ignore all of the antifa violence and all of the other progressive protests and all of the stuff from this weekend they would have to do all of that\nUh Republicans don't have to work to recast Democrat protests as anything I've you know I think burning buildings and punching people in the face and doing all of that stuff uh they do a good enough job of that they're by themselves\nThey do they do a good enough job of that all by themselves\n\nAnd they work and like for instance with the cabinet situation I have seen and this is the left is really stepped up their attempts to try to dehumanize people with whom they disagree\nI've seen them tried to cast the cat's Kavanaugh and and everything else as well he's you know he is a uh he's guilty as he rape is she is that they're making statements about him that have been no proof there's more proof of big foot then there is that the any of these accusations are true\nThere's more proof that the abominable snowman exists and there are that any of these accusations are true there is more prove hell and global warming than there is that any of these accusations are true\n\nThere's more proof of the last man than there is that any of these accusations are true more proof of Santa more proof of the tooth fairy and more proof of the Easter Bunny than there are any accusation then they're then there was any proof that these accusations are true\nBottom line\nBut it hasn't stopped the left from still trying to cast you want to talk about working to cast their working to cast\nThe now justice and trying to they they they want to up in the Supreme Court now and that's not me just saying is I was looking at Lawrence O'Donnell they want to be Shakespeare MSNBC who was saying well this you know we really are going to have to uh we're gonna you know we have to rethink\nYou know talking about the Supreme Court and and and maybe uh maybe you know in the number of senators you know ... maybe we shouldn't have just X amount of senators et cetera so see this is this is there\nThis was their standard if you lose an election a democratic lose an election it's not then and it's not their candidate and it's not their messaging\nIt's the electoral college we have to bend it if they\nLose a Supreme Court nomination it's not the fact that they're out there ambushing people in restaurants or or ambushing them at their homes are screaming at the airport\nIt to the Senate that's the problem this is why they don't win because they don't get it\nThey don't\nRepublicans don't have to work to cast him as anything they've they've done that themselves they have done it themselves and now I'm looking at polling\nAnd it is well it's not going good for them they may have hurt themselves in terms of being able to try to flip the house I looked at the point I mean literally at Huffington Post they have twelve self care tips if you're struggling to deal with everything today\nPractice deep breathing recognize your emotions and allow yourself to feel them take a social media\nAmbushing them at their homes are screaming at them in the airport\nIt to the Senate that's the problem this is why they don't win because they don't get it\nThey don't\nRepublicans don't have to work to cast him as

it's all just they did it themselves they did it themselves now\nTaylor Swift I Know\nI think she finally about to the mob and decided well if I'm going to come out I'm just going to do it with with

don't think she wrote that I don't think that she didn't I just think that she's uninformed\nAnd I do think that you can find that to be ignorant but she's just uninformed and that's the other shoe to prove it but showed the money she did not road like he's on record for opposing the things that she was like sitting here saying that she doesn't want a candidate to oppose and if she doesn't endorses them I'm like have you did you\nLike research that's at all [noise] did you research at all so I think she's totally you can completely mock her for that you can totally mock her for that so no I think\nThat she did I think that I think that she I think she probably voted off roof it but I don't know if she got now I think she probably I think she probably did but the thing is when you have that when you play that many people maybe just double check and have one of them be like okay do they do all the stuff I'm staying here they had the same position to right\nOtherwise it's just weird you know I mean it's just otherwise it's just silly\nI now I don't know so I'm I wanted to\nMove on to this as well I mean I have a lot of windows open here uh anymore monitors but\nSo pollsters are

conventional wisdom that you bring the men on a mission to retire America One at a time when I go\nBack to the radio show with me here today is mark ... investor out of hundreds of Beach California or the first segment mark was go uh sharing with us how he jumped into the business on his own uh had a couple of properties it accumulated with his wife and mother and that will change the subject of over ... how'd you find does\nAnd what were the the process you went through to get involved with us\nI think back at the time I was trying to learn what I could about managing the single family homes and the ... like we had and so I was\nLooking on I think I tuned in one day and looking for pod cast than I\nCame upon the lifestyles unlimited podcast and I started listening to that I have about a\nTwenty five minute commute to school in the morning and rather than listening to music I always enjoy something that's going to teach me and I started listening to lifestyles and eventually after listening for quite a while I I joined um as an F F the member and\nUm was able to access the online\nCourses including the two days seminar and so sort of went from there\nSo when you took the two days ago you took it over the Internet I assume the first time around and what did you get out of it the first time around that was a different than what you thought what you know what was the aha moments where does it\nYeah I think there were there were two main things is that out for me ah one was that uh I had heard on the podcast that if you properly learn how to screen your tenants that Ninety eight percent or somewhere around there have you had a problem can be avoided altogether [noise] and so I've\nListening to music I always enjoy something that's going to teach me and if I started listening to lifestyles and eventually after listening for quite a while I I joined um as an F F team member and um was able to access the online\nCourses including the two days seminar and so sort of went from there\nSo when you took the two day seminar you took it over the Internet I assume the first time around and what did you get out of the first time around that was a different to what you thought what you know what was the aha moments where like I said\nYeah I think there were there were two main things is that it out for me um one was that uh I had heard on the podcast that if you properly learn how to screen your tenants that Ninety eight percent or somewhere around there have you attended problems can be avoided altogether\nAnd so I've managed to property for probably about Fifteen Years now and and for the most part I've done a pretty good job of that after learning\nHow to properly screened tennis but I you know my one nightmare tennis that I had a I have to take responsibility for was really the fact that I did not screened correctly and I got somebody in there that you would refer to as a purple Martian and with a created a lot of stress and tension during the time that that time it was in there\nWas that was one of the ... and then I think really the second aha the first time I took it on line was just the whole idea of lifestyles um creating\nUm best product of price and so\nIn our four Plex that we had when we had a tenant move out we would totally redo the unit and get it back to you know top notch um condition and three of the four units in that building have been totally redone now the fourth unit of had attended in there for so long that we haven't had to\nHave the ability to turn it over yet but I think those were the two main things that that I learned that was back in two thousand Thirteen\nOr what she started taking actions and then it was all your two two thousand Eighteen to you upgrade your membership let's walk through the process\nThat you went through that I think it was like three steps you went to this into this than it is the kind of change your mind that you wanted to do more once you step is through that process\nOkay uh well I think the first thing I did is I I wanted my wife to be on board with this and so she and I went out to Palm Springs I think it was back in January and they had a meat del event and we had a chance to meet you and to hear from Brian deferred and I wanted her to sort of understand what lifestyles unlimited was all about and then the following month\nI we went back to the two day in Palm Springs and uh she came with me along with my father in law and are really going through the two day in person I had a couple of other\nAha moments and one of the biggest one was that you know I had these homes in Southern California that we're starting to build up a fair amount of equity because\nI don't want them for Fifteen Years but that equity wasn't a helping me in any way it was just sitting there I wasn't getting any kind of a benefit or any kind of cash flow out of that\nSo one of the biggest a ha moment for me is I Know that you have a lot of people do the calculation where you look at your net worth and you figure out you know what percent are you making off of your net worth and uh when I figured that out it wasn't\nYou know it wasn't that great so I thought there needs to be something I can do to change and I figured if I figured out a way to unlock some of the equity in these properties and read a play at that I can probably shave I'm thinking maybe seven or so years off the end of my teaching career\nUm and so that was probably my biggest ahah going to be\nA two day in person yeah excuse me in that situation when you look at it that how about the second day you know now that you took\nHelping me in any way it was just sitting there I wasn't getting any kind of a benefit or any kind of cash flow out of that so one of the biggest a ha moment for me is I Know that you have a lot of people do the calculation where you look at your network and you figure out you know what percent are you making off of your network and uh when I figured that out it wasn't\nYou know it wasn't that great so I thought there needs to be something I can do to change and I figured if I figured out a way to unlock some of the equity in these properties and redeploy at that I can probably shave I'm thinking maybe seven or so years off the end of my teaching career\nUm and so that was probably my biggest ... going to be\nA two day in person yeah [noise] excuse me in that situation when you look at it that\nHow about the second day you know now you took it live you took what support on the Internet now you took it live ... what a humble she opened the second biggest you hadn't been mentioning that so much you writing and went\n... things are right there are a couple of things um one is that when I took the seminar live I had the opportunity to actually meet people that were invested in deals and so when you hear something on the radio sometimes\nYou know you haven't talked to somebody flesh and blood that's actually doing these um deals and so one of the first people I met in Palm Springs with Steve Anderson who is our Southern California ambassador that I'm working with\nAnd lifestyles and he was just a real easy to get to know person reached out to me answer questions um he was in I think seven multifamily deals at the time so I said oh I'm actually talking to somebody that's in in these multi family deals that I'm hearing about I'm\nAlso had the opportunity to meet caring and Dan Tucker who are are ambassadors in Southern California well but I think looking at the multi family the second day as I've heard a lot of people say I'm you know you realize that you can actually have forced appreciation when you get a multi family property so you can buy a property that is\nMaybe a little down and out how some room for improvement you can infuse them capital into that you can\nI'm really fix it up Redskin rise the ah occupancy can rise and then because the value of that building is gonna be a a multiple of the net operating income you can basically create value there and the idea of being a passive investor for me in a property like that where I could\nPotentially create a a bigger return or be a part of somebody else creating this return\nUm that was very very appealing to me\nWhile I wanted to ask you this question and ever since I knew that's going to interview a trick question but what about the ban your math teacher did the math not just blow you away when you looked at the fact that the the\nLarger about uh back when you had to lower the rate of return that refinancing actually raised the rate of return that the ability to refinance or pull all your money awkward infinite rates of return uh what about all that math is a math teacher did that not just blow your mind it down to the holy or intuitive ...\nYes it is and in fact it's it's funny because the properties that we held I never actually took the time to do the math on some of them I didn't really look at it that way I said well I have this property and makes me X amount per month and that sort of the end of it and I didn't really look at well there's this much and the property and this is the ... percent return I'm getting\nA which I probably you know it wasn't that I can do the math but I probably\nDidn't know the correct way to approach or thinking about that\nUh what about all that mad as a math teacher did that not just blow your mind to do that at least that's what we are into it\nYes it is and in fact it's it's funny because the properties that we held I never actually took the time to do the math on some of them I didn't really look at it that way I said well I have this property and makes me X amount per month and that sort of the end of it and I didn't really look at well there's this much and the property and this was the percent return I'm getting\nA which I probably you know whether that I can do the math but I\nDidn't know the correct way to approach or thinking about that\nA maple trail with proper Martinez and um you know I think he carved out a spot for me as a new investor which I really appreciate it and I I told him as much and so that was the first deal I got into and and the second deal I also made a contact through the expo and was able to um get into my next feel that way as well\nIt's interesting that um I think a lot of people believe the same thing a mark and it's going to be difficult to get into these deals and I know that when I decided to go passive or just earlier this couple of months ago\nA bit out of nowhere\nHard like eight or ten deals right on my plate just boom boom boom boom boom there they're out there they're all over the place was just a matter of getting involved with it um\nSince you started I Know there's no mostly students don't pay off in the first couple of months so we won't go into returns let's talk about your plan into the future what do you see and how do you see your plan developing here\nWell I'm I guess that I could be if I worked until I was sixty five I could be teaching for another you know nine years and I'm thinking that uh as I mentioned earlier maybe I can shave seven years or so off of that so I'm thinking I may work for another year or two in my really my plan in the meantime has to\nRead the play as much money as I can out of these other properties that we have an addiction to the house we just fold we also or refinanced our other single family home um about three or four months ago and I was able to already take that money and that's part of what allowed me to get into some of these other deals\nAnd so I really my goal is to get\nAs much money working for me as possible and the multi family um arena and try to create a passive income that's going to\nSort of sit on top of a what I get from my state teachers' retirement so I've been teaching Thirty years so I Will get some kind of a retirement I'm from doing that and then I'm I'm hoping that once I get all this set up then I'll be able to you know keep and maybe even increase my standard of living compared to what I've been doing um as a full time\nWorker okay\nUh well I looked at it\nOut of these other properties that we have so in addition to the house we just sold we also are refinanced our other single family home um about three or four months ago and I was able to already take that money and that's part of what allowed me to get into some of these other deals and so I really my goal is to get\nAs much money working for me as possible in the multi family um arena and try to create a path of income that's going to\nSort of sit on top of a what I get from my state teachers' retirement so I've been teaching Thirty years so I Will get some kind of a retirement I'm from doing that and then I'm I'm hoping that once I get\nAll this set up and I'll be able to you know keep and maybe even increase my standard of living compared to what I've been doing um as a full time worker okay\nUh well I looked at it and I thought you know if I have already always says well if I would've knowing what I Know now Twenty years ago Thirty years ago you know I Know lifestyles\nOne of their Montrose as you know retiring five years or less than I I Believe that's totally possible and so I look at uh my kids who are both in middle school I have a sixth grade boy and an eighth grade girl and I want them to have options as they're growing up and so I thought well how can I sort of start to introduce the idea of real estate investing to them\nAnd one of the things that I did as a teacher is I sort of created a a two\nPage sheet that had properties specifications and just all the important information that somebody would need to know pretty basic information about um apartment complexes in the first of all I got in with a rod Herman Cain has had both my daughter Katie and my son Josh\nFill out a forum that included you know what was the purchase price how much cash where they raising what year it was a building bill what are the humanities and all that kind of thing and then we took a look at they actually went through the ... pm I did they didn't we'd all be beyond that they had certain pages where they would find out what are the returns supposed to be in the first couple of years and what their\nUm you know expectation down the line as far as doing a refinance or a or you know a sale in the future and I I actually took and my mother when\nMy kids were born at given them each two thousand dollars um to go toward their college fund and I was supposed to put it in a five twenty nine plan or something like that and I never got around to that and they finally hit me a\nFew months back that you know let me let them get into my deals and so the deal that I invested with Robert Martinez had each in my kids um invest a thousand dollars into that deal unofficially of course they're not official owners and uh so\nThey're they're tracking that with me I'm Robert turns out nice um video showing what they've done on the rehab on the property we got so I watched that with the kids and we discuss\nUm just the different aspects of the deal and they're sort of excited because they're actually in the deal and I said as long as you're interested and you know you can remain in this and we'll keep learning if you've ever say I don't want to do this any more than I'll give you a thousand dollars back that we invested in this deal and and we'll just go from there but my daughter has\nYou know she's learned quite a bit she's pretty smart girl and she's learned about depreciation in Texas I'm covering the income better than it does in California so she knows that and she's been talking about that and my son Josh asking me questions like so if we get if they do a

hypnotic the number one dot com\nYou don't want I Want to work with a lot of people it's just not one thing that you fix and then move on it's the idea that your attitude because it's really the attitude of the person what makes certain people seemed like there always successful and it always happens easy for them\nOr maybe they're thinking different and that's what they really are they're thinking different so that's what I Do with people\nI have them focus on their solutions and not their problem\nWhen I ask people which you focus on your problem one of the solution Ninety nine percent um say the problem I said that's why you still have it focus on your solution and then go while I don't know what that is or\nYou know when we get them to go with doing that because you got a solution for every situation so why not put it into actions because of your failing already how much worse can again\nNow you can call on direct again that number six oh two five four seven zero for for six you're going to get a free sixty minute consultation that comes along with the MP three or the CD whatever works for you\nAgain we're going to talk about the customized program and what that means he won't let you fail it's a lifetime guarantee basically let me tell you something if you're not picking up the phone and calling doc\nThat's the only reason why you're feeling\nYeah that's because you don't know how to say or don't know how to succeed there's two reasons people fail it anything first they don't know how to succeed seconds they don't want to bad enough so if you're listening to me and you think well you know wanted works for everybody else now call from my husband recall for my kids but I'll I'll see how it works for them but I won't do it yet\nUh that's how you keep feeley is keep doing the same thing over and over again waiting to see somebody else successful and then trying yourself successful you really are well\nI don't know about any of you out there but I Know this year of all of the years has been pretty strange I don't know what it is it's really strange here I think a lot\nOf people are dealing with more now than ever seems like\nOf the people come in for weight loss or stop smoking or alcohol or drugs and and I've had a lot of alcohol and drugs this year coming in um most of the really the underlying cause is not the drug is they're depressed they're they're practicing depression\nThey took stress and put it into depression because they keep practicing they wake up depressed they work\nAnd I'll call from my husband recall for my kids but I'll I'll see how it works for them but I won't do it yet um that's how you keep failing is keep doing the same thing over and over again waiting to see somebody else successful and then trying yourself successful you really are\nWell I don't know about any of you out there but I Know this year of all the years has been pretty strange I don't know what it is it's really strange here I think a lot of people are dealing with more now than ever seems like\nMost of the people who come in for weight loss or stop smoking or alcohol or drugs and and I've had a lot of alcohol and drugs to this year coming in um most of the really the underlying cause is not the drug it's they're depressed they're they're practicing depression\nThey took stress and put it into depression because they keep practicing they wake up depressed they will walk through the whole day depressed that go to bed depressed\nAnd nobody wants to be around them because they're so depressing but that makes the depression even worse so they got to get him out of the depression before you can actually work on a lot of the other thing\nIt's really going into the underlying cause\nAnd that's it we fix the problem we don't deal with symptoms symptoms might be drugs or smoking or that that's a symptom we go back and find a problem solve the problem and get rid of the problem the symptoms disappeared\nLeaving messages on the air right now but leave a message she wants to hear from you and I think everyone wants to feel better sit there to fight for seven zero for for sex let's talk about some of these other things that we've done before I Love doing this with you so obviously let's talk about when we talk about all of this stuff it really comes down to one thing to fears\nFears and and it really is a fear in lack of motivation but\nFear will stop you from doing anything fear of failure some people have fears success or it's getting rid of those fears Ninety nine percent of your fears that you have will never really happened unless you make them happen so we get rid of the fears and put you in control again\nOf your thoughts and your situations and your emotions panic attack panic attacks another fear it just comes on you know ... be beyond the fear part and it will lock you up they'll make you ... you know why we got to get rid of those\nI've worked with drivers a lot of drivers and they get so scared of driving they can't drive anymore\nNow they got to have people take them to work and pick 'em up taking the grocery store and pick them up and they're thirty and forty years old we get him out of that because the longer you practice they fear the deeper seeded it becomes\nNow how many how people would sleep\nSleep is so natural it's a natural thing that you are born with is one of the few natural things it's almost like breathing but all of a sudden people start thinking and they keep their self awake at night and they start thinking on what they did that day and what they what they messed up and and how they should have done it\nTheir mind is always working on full speed and what we do is just slow it down and have him automatically go to sleep a usually on the people after they listen to my CD when I talk to him one on one you'll see 'em start closing the rise down because it's out of my voice I guess gets do him\nWell again that number to call directed six so two five four seven zero for for six it's hypnotic the number one dot com he's been doing it for over Thirty years he\nHas a Ninety eight percent success rate you're going to get that CD at it you're going to be able to take that home and you're going to be able to do this you're all on your own basically it's a customized pro ramp to meet your needs he won't let you fail and\nIt's a lifetime guarantee you can't get any more than that\nThe difference between a successful person and a failure successful people will do it failures refused do won't do or can't do and I never\nSpeed and what we do is just slow it down and have him automatically go to sleep a usually on the people after they listened my CD when I talk to him one on one you'll see 'em start closing the rise down because it's out of my voice I guess gets do him\nWell again that number to call directed six so two five four seven zero for for six it's hypnotic the number one dot com he's been doing it for over Thirty years he\nHas a Ninety eight percent success rate you're going to get that CD at if you're going to be able to take that home and you're going to be able to do this you're all on your own basically it's a customized pro ramp to meet your needs he won't let you fail and it's a lifetime guarantee you can't get any more than that\nThe difference between a successful person and a failure successful people will do it failures refused do won't do or can't do and I never ask a plan to do something that's very hard difficult or they can't do is usually something very easy and all of a sudden they become successful\nAnd when you feel that you want to even do more you'll feel better\nYeah if they if they all of a sudden double their income now they want to double again I Want to double it again\nThey all of a sudden find out that there are the ones that's been holding themselves back they are the ones that's making excuses of ... ah yeah it's easy for everybody else but it's the wrong time of year it's wrong economy it's wrong this I've got the wrong has been wrong why for the wrong kids in the wrong school\nAnd I want work with what you've got and make it successful\nAgain that number to call leave a message at six so two five four seven zero for for six how about this we all need a little bit more self confidence\nBecause if you don't have confidence you probably won't think you'll succeed so why do it if you don't succeed and the thing is we give you a self confidence they may start small and all of a sudden he gets bigger and bigger and bigger and stronger and stronger\nAnd then all of a sudden you have self discipline and then your self esteem raises and then you're all of a sudden looking at things that you haven't done the past\nYou would like to do and how you doing here and I've got to tell you one today when I was over in Thailand this year\nI I stopped and I saw this place for learning scuba diving and I thought well you know what I'm old but you don't want 'em a drive and see if they'll if each scuba diving was green fantastic he says you're your age you want to do it I says yeah\nSo next year when I go back much your typical this coming year when I go back I Want to get my deep water license so that I'm going to do the barrier reef\nHa isn't that neat and you had a great time when you're there all I Do and you know and and the people around me seemed to have a good time to do what you do everywhere you know you'd almost anywhere that\nThat's it that's it and I'm going to work a little bit in Australia next year like I did before and I just have a good time and help people out\nBecause you really that's what you're doing you're all about getting people to their goals and what they want to me\nThat said you don't want I I Can't reach it through the radio waves them getting off the couch but the thing is or through the phone lines but the thing is once they come in it's very relaxed atmosphere I\nAnswer all their questions and I answered a lot of questions they didn't even have an all of a sudden they said well yeah I can do that if somebody else I can do that and I show them a couple of film clips and says yeah that's me I can be that person\nDoc I Want you to talk a little bit about what makes you different 'cause there's people that you know what you do not like you know no one

what's really important is to have him reviewed as well so what do you have one or not listen up everyone because this is important information out there so it will good enough or does does somebody need a trust [noise]\nYeah I think that's a that's probably one of the most common questions people ask is a after we give you a little bit of education they say well what do you think is a well going to be good enough for my situation or do I need to trust and\nThat the answer really is it depends um it depends on lots of factors that depends on um I think ultimately it boils down to the kind of control that you want to have for your assets if you pass away\nOkay really bought what it boils down to is let me tell you how important that is [laughter] anyone that has a parents that have passed and they're both gone now all know the importance of what that is\nThat's right I think that that uh I think that back if people's mind I think that that yeah you think that everybody's going to get

and you can also call in here and I'll get you connect with him I loved working with them sick so to to seven seven five three six nine okay [noise] we're down here\nSo you told me that a trust might be useful but in ... if there is a blended family situation\nYeah I think that if you have a a maybe a relationship later in life or maybe a late in life marriage and you you have adult children maybe on both sides of the fence\nUm I think there there's a need to protect each other rights to protect your ah your significant other maybe you want to make sure that uh if you pass away that your significant other can live in the house\nOr without having the house be sold and um you may want to protect somebody in that way um and you want to make sure that your adult children are protected at the same time so that we can try to reduce the conflict specially of it that first death\nIf there's a conference a confrontation in regular families which they happen all the time it means that when there's a blended family it's got to be that much worse\nI think it's harder especially if you if you have a late in life relationship and you you already have adult children um I think that it makes it tougher um so having a clear plan that everybody understands that uh your significant other and your kids all all can see the plan laid out I think it does make things a little bit easier\nNow okay can you think of any major control factors that would require a trust or versus a well\nSure I think that um I think that if you own a business you might have an aloe sea of your own or a corporation interest a that's a good reason to make sure that\nYou have all your uh eyes and cheese are taken care of their and and that you your trust talks about those businesses and the businesses to talk about your trust so we we walk you through\nAre the types of documents you need to consider 'em but anybody that had brought ownership of interest you know property accounts retirement stocks those are all reasons as you have more broader um broader assets uh to get it to maybe you need more control over the the distribution of your state\nNow when people talk with you this is a free

want to talk to you a little bit about how great it is by doing it with you with desert financial because\nOf what they can actually have all of the documents and everything on hand there at the ... bank that they keep it there so nobody would ever ever really lose anything there's rock little bit about\nThat is right we always we always prepared to touch of documents than we sign two sets of documents so there's two live copies and obviously you would take one with you when you set up your documents in we retain alive copy\nWe sort of that ad or corporate office for safety keeping and we

if something happened so\nUm that's that that's always the start of a [laughter] as soon as we as you start a conversation that's right\nSo but but by naming guardians I think if you're a young couple that certainly inappropriate document to have in place and an needed one if there's an accident um also maybe if you're a widow with some simple assets maybe you just have a simple bank account maybe a a property\nUm you can you can do a well what's been officially designations and including a deed on your home to avoid probate and make sure your assets go to your adult beneficiaries I'm so those are those are some examples of the world will is certainly appropriate\nWhat happens when things could appropriate probate\nSo probative the the legal process that the loved one time to go through and it's it's essentially paperwork through the court it's filing the appropriate paperwork it's filing fees it's getting permission from the judge to carry out\nUm ah the wishes of of the deceased and so it's generally a delay it the cost is stress\nI'm so sometimes probate can go on for a year more longer and sometimes those fees rack up and a lot of times people don't want to mess up the paperwork so they get an attorney\nTo guide them through the process which is expensive a little bit more cost right so and and it's I think ultimately it's not really about the time or the or the cost is really about the stress\nAnd it's it's if if you prepare your documents you're helping alleviate that stretch from it all up\nI've said this many times there's documents and then there's documents that work much right and I've said this before why you are on a before that that I've had my father had documents and he had the will and the trust yet everything right but one not down right I mean that was the one thing is once silly little thing that was just\nThat's what makes it a problem and you guys I implore everybody out there listening\nGive them a call it's it's it gets it's just a free consultation and you'll find out what is it that you need and by the way you don't need to have a lot I don't have a lot at all\nYou know it's not even about that it's about what are your wishes right you know I've even told my ex husband who was I told them to call who you know you it's not about what you have what do you want when you when you pass away\nIt's if if you prepare your documents you're helping alleviate that stretch from it all up\nI've said this many times there's documents and then there's documents that work much right and I've said this before why you were on a before that that\nI've had my father had documents and he had the will and the trust yet everything right but what not done right I mean that was the one thing is once silly little thing that was just\nThat's what makes it a problem and you guys I implore everybody out there listening\nGive them a call it's it's it gets it's just a free consultation and you'll find out what it is that you need and by the way you don't need to have a lot I don't have a lot at all\nYou know it's not even about that it's about what are your wishes right you know I've even told my ex husband who was I told them to call who you know you it's not about what you have what do you want when you when you pass away what do you want to have happen\nYeah and I am at any given it goes back to that let your family grave when he passed away don't let them stress about those details right have those details handled so that they can focus on you know celebrating your life and getting through the grieving

entail plant of the apple ... apple plant in the in the east valley\nThese are plants go in and they they start ramping up well there's going to be small auxiliary businesses that are grow up around there there'll be contractor so many people who will you know maybe provide parts maybe subcontractors for the plant all of a sudden this one plant or a large plant goes in it just spreads out over the entire\nState or at least Maricopa County and ah so these things are starting to happen we're starting to see it um [noise] the west valley or we're starting to see Microsoft is building a large data center in Goodyear\nA data center what's the data center well they're large warehouse is of course but what the data center as it was interesting I was at a brokers meeting luncheon today and

way but ah they're just you know full of computers and that's where all this data comes running through and there's data centers all over all over the world but you know all over the United states\nAnd so they're building or a Microsoft\nTo maybe be subcontractors for the plant all of a sudden this one plant or a large plant goes in it just spreads out over the entire state or at least Maricopa County\nAnd uh so these things are starting to happen we're starting to see it um [noise] the west valley or we're starting to see Microsoft is building a large data center in Goodyear\nA data center what's the data center well they're large warehouse is of course but what the data center as it was interesting I was at her broker's many lunch and today we're talking about it one guy said\nThat's the cloud so a data center is the cloud so when you put something in the clouds these large buildings they use a tremendous amount of electricity by the way but uh they're just you know

Microsoft is really a data center in good you're there's another data center that's a supposedly going to go up out there there's four hundred acres in escrow in the south west valley right now and industrial real estate\nSo it's it's amazing what's happening this this new dynamic that's coming in also up in the in the north west valley and surprise we have one of the first new railroad parks\nGoing in in the city a surprise and uh you know river park but what what\nWhat exactly is when you love it I can just sit back as I as true true train what the heck is he talking about [laughter]\nBut anyway um so rail is is a uh it's very important part of industrial real estate was railroad for railroad is is removing heavy materials steel coal\nAh you know plastic pellets for a plastic manufacturing so both products so that's what real is four and uh so we don't we really haven't had any expansion of railroad in this state for I don't know twenty twenty five years maybe\nAnd actually they've you know the railroad has kind of shrunk into a certain degree but this is a new park and there's a large manufacturing company that's going to be going in there so it's going to be a large I Believe it to steal a steel fabrication facility is going to go into right on that new rail line so in New ... going in is really\nYou know it's a game changer it'll be a game changer for that or for a surprise and and that North West valley area\nSo we're seeing that uh and it's real interesting I have a I Am working with a couple of large projects in that market\nAnd I'm seeing some
