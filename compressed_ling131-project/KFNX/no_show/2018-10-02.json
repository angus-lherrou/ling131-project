they were the judge jury and a hangman\nBut it was not unanimous there are those who said no don't crucified Jesus it's a repeat of history in some ways it's crazy\nI Would never make it through a hearing why should I be why would I Want to be on the Supreme Court to sit in the black robe all day long with a gamble who would want to ensure that you're doing you know I don't even understand why anybody wants that job\nHow to even take a job being a judge what Hoover's it takes to be a judge but nevertheless\nWe have a Supreme Court which by the way\nIs so overpowered it's beyond belief whoever made them the the be all and end all of human existence\nThese individuals are going to determine the out the outcome of our nation\nYou know that's a whole topic for another day\nMy consult in said that ... was two hundred and twenty nine years old and Seventeen eighty nine George Washington signed into law the Jewish reactive Seventeen eighty nine\nWhich is the average the federal court system including the Supreme Court of the United states\nYou don't know there's a number of justices has changed over the over time\nCongress increased the number\nTo a seven\nIt was originally for they increase it to seven in Eighteen oh seven they increased it to nine\nJudges Nineteen thirty seven they increase it to ten judges Nineteen sixty three\nAnd then listen to this to show you how malleable plastic the number of people on the Supreme Court really is\nAnd then in order to prevent president Andrew Johnson\nWho was shown to be impeached\nFrom naming any new Supreme Court justices Congress pass the judicial circuits act\nOf Eighteen sixty six\nAnd that act reduced the number from ten to seven\nThe decrease was to take effect as the seats became vacant that's something that Dianne Feinstein would like to do right now which is reduced the number of seats to prevent Trump from appointing either when you get it\nSo if you think this is something new in American society are mistaken the viciousness may be different\nBut the message is the same it's all about power\nOnly two seats were freed up by Eighteen sixty nine so there were eight justices\nCongress added back one Supreme and decided there should be nine justices\nSo the judiciary act of Eighteen sixty nine officially sat the number that we have an out of nine and there's not budge since\nThat leads me to the next question of the day\nAnd it's not a facetious question which is should the number of Supreme Court justices immediately be increased I think it should why nine it was once for then it was six than it was seven\nNow it's nine has been nine since the Eighteen sixties right\nWhy don't we increase the number of justices while Trump is in power [laughter]\nWouldn't that be fun I also think there should be age limits on a Supreme Court justices there was no question in my mind it should be age limits on people\nOnly two seats were freed up by Eighteen sixty nine so there were eight justices\nCongress added back one Supreme and decided there should be nine justices\nSo the judiciary act of Eighteen sixty nine officially set the number that we have now um nine and there's not budge since\nThat leads me to the next question of the day\nAnd it's not a facetious question which is should the number of Supreme Court justices immediately be increased I think it should why nine it was once for then it was six than it was seven\nNow it's nine it's been nine since the Eighteen sixties right\nWhy don't we increase the number of justices while Trump is in power [laughter]\nWouldn't that be fun I also think there should be age limits on a Supreme Court justices there was no question in my mind that should be age limits on people in Congress\nAnd age limits on people are on the Supreme Court there was no question in my mind that Dianne Feinstein should have been aged out a long time ago forget her left the psychotic politics\nBut age age limits on Supreme Court justices age limits\nOn judges in in general and also age limits in Congress for sure a hundred percent right be right back\nEnjoying the Savage Nation Coleman oh eight five four hundred Savage

to the NFL I said this was a this was a deal that cut across political winds so and\nAnd the NFL which hasn't exactly been a big fan of Donald Trump's up to now is that going to be able to uh sell advertising in Canada which it previously prior to disagreement the NFL could only show ads that it had\nShown in the United states and Canada so lost a big revenue opportunity that's going to be gone they're going to be able to make money up there so it's really a benefit for a broad swath of the American business community and an American workers\nSandy we're going to have most in most most of the male ads running in during NFL games or something along those lines\nOr didn't surprise me at all I mean if the games are popular up there I'm\nSure that the um the the the products that are most popular with Canadians will not want to buy at space or during NFL games and that's a that's a benefit to the NFL I said this was a this was a deal that cut across the political lines are in in Mexico the unions love the deal in Mexico because it's requiring\nThat I think it's twenty five percent of every ... built by people that are making at least sixteen dollars an hour and it opened up the um opportunities for Mexicans to unionize so is this is a I I I you know nobody should be criticizing the steel this was a great deal that it\nMeets a commitment that President Trump made that certainly absolutely shows as many of us have been saying that he wasn't trying to impose terrorists to destroy free trade he was trying to make a make a trade free or by making it fairer and in this deal does\nThat look in the in the ... part of the afternoon of Monday right after the deal's been done they said the steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place you'd expect those to go away or at least to be substantially modified or is there a reason they're still in place and they didn't go away automatically when this was done\nI I wouldn't be surprised if ah if there were some exceptions made for Canadian steel obviously Canada doesn't doesn't uh pose a national security threat to the United states now there may be some qualifications put in that with respect to whether or not they could sell steal but they imported as opposed\nTo seal their manufacturing in Canada but I I wouldn't be surprised to see that but\nThis agreement does not contemplate that a candidate was in a quarter in negotiating disagreement and\nUh I think the president got just about everything he wanted a from the Canadians and from the Mexican says well orange just answering a strong negotiating position something that I don't think other presidents either perceived or we're willing to take the risk the political risks of abusing that power they had in these negotiations\nI'm Talking to Andy ... who's who was the first nominee to head the U.S department of labor and author of the capital's comeback can you talk at all about the increased intellectual property protections in this because as I understand that's one of those details that may not be as sexy to people but but it's\nTremendously important when it comes to dealing not only with our allies like Mexico and Canada but dealing with some real antagonistic folks like the Chinese\nWell it's it's it it was important to with respect to Mexico and Canada we always want to make sure that our intellectual property is protected as well outside the United states as it is inside the United states but with Canada and Mexico that wasn't as big a problem\nWith Canada and Mexico I think the bigger deal was updating\nOr the IT laws when it came to to digital sales are things that have developed since the early Nineteen nineties uh when when after was originally passed with China this is a huge issue China\nDoes everything it possibly can to steal American technology I'm done that it is it on that for many many years there was a study by an independent commission here in the United states a congressional commission\nThat determined that they've done everything they can espionage wise and a ... to seal or intellectual property we did the company I used to run the business in China even a fast food restaurant company like ours too\nPort with respect to Mexico and Canada we always want to make sure that our intellectual property is protected as well outside the United states as it is inside the United states but with Canada and Mexico that wasn't as big a problem with Canada and Mexico I think the bigger deal was updating\nOr the IT laws when it came to to digital sales are things that have developed since the early Nineteen nineties out when when after was originally passed with China this is a huge issue China\nDoes everything it possibly can to steal American technology I'm done that it's on that for many many years there was a study by an independent commission here in the United states a congressional commission\nThat determined that they've done everything they can espionage wise and uh I'd write theft wise to seal or intellectual property we did the company I used to run the business in China and even a fast food restaurant company like ours to open franchise restaurants in and say in Shanghai we had to get\nA Chinese partner and you know you have a partner there they're exposed to everything you know no we didn't have\nBig trade secrets that the Chinese would have wanted but any country any company that went in to try and I had to bring in a Chinese partners and often was required to disclose intellectual property I'm just to do business in China which is grossly unfair and one of the things that I Am absolutely confident after the election\nOf President Trump will be able to resolve I don't think we're going to see any progress with Europe and China pending the election because there's no outside for China in Europe to negotiate a deal before the election they think the president may may lose some power after the election if the Republicans were unable to hold the house are unable to hold the Senate\nAnd if they canceled either one of them is going to be spending more time arguing with a with the Democrats about impeachment than he is negotiating better trade deals which would be a tragedy for the United states in American workers so I'm hoping Republicans will\nStay in power and then after the election I think will get better trade deals\nYou know you would think Andy this is one of those things that Democrats and Republicans from time to time so this is a bipartisan issue like national security is bipartisan but the different sides see different\nSolutions to different problems why do you suppose it is the Republicans are so much more concerned about say protecting things like intellectual property then the Democrats seem to be because it does happen to agree to dramatic effect\nOn uh on on jobs I remember there was one company that had it's a a software technology for controllers for windmills ripped off\nAnd they had a thousand people working for them in the United states and they almost one out of business so festive intellectual property could have put a thousand people on the bricks that that should be something that transcends ideological barriers in the United states shouldn't it\n... it it should and to some extent it does we had Chuck Schumer um and and Elizabeth Warren both actually\nI have been somewhat supportive of the president on this and make a warrant told CNN\nThat she thought president from putting terrorists on the table with respect to China was a good idea and should be part of the trade policy uh humor to a tumor was very operator but he said China takes total advantage of the United states steel or electoral property using ... cyber theft he's\nThe ... they are more aligned with President Trump on this issue than they are with others but I I tell you what I can uh I'd be very surprised if either of them at anything good to say about anything he negotiates I'm sure they look for whatever vulnerability they could find in the agreement because\nAh we're we're to the point where anything President Trump wants to do even if it's things that Schumer and warn and other Democrats support they're going to criticize it just because it's President Trump\nA day which is one of the reasons we're having such a hard time moving forward in this country with things that have to go through Congress up at the president seems to be getting a lot done despite that opposition so I I think we'll see continued progress\nShould be part of the trade policy a short cello was very operated by you said China takes total advantage of the United states steel or electrical properties using ... cyber theft these\n... they are more aligned with President Trump on this issue than they are with others but I I tell you what I can uh\nI'd be very surprised if ... or ... anything good to say about anything he negotiates I'm sure they look for whatever vulnerability they could find in the agreement because ah we're we're to the point where anything that President Trump wants to do even if it's things they show learn one and other Democrats support they're going to criticize it just because it's President Trump\nA day which is one of the reasons rapping such a hard time moving forward in this country with things that have to go through Congress but the president seems to be getting a lot done despite that opposition so I I think we'll see continued progress\nTwo masters a bachelor's degree but she can't remember how much oil was crap you know that was required to pass the testing a thought to get all those degrees you can't remember jak\nBut she can ... camp or the specifics for the most devastating events she ever had in her lifetime she can't remember how she got there you know how she got home I mean it's like\nThere's a lot of holes in this woman's case that anything I could ever imagine I cannot help but feel that I think if you and that's the gay\n... the series of how she probably was coached going into last everything this find out that this was completely uh scammed by the Democrats which leads to my second point\nWhy are they not held to civil and criminal criminal penalties for smearing the good name a judge Kavanaugh\nWell first of all there is no criminal penalty for smearing somebody that I Know of\nAlthough I guess you could say the so called hate crimes are at a an effort to do it at a very low level where if you use certain kinds of words you could be charged with a crime on the civil side somebody could sue Dianne Feinstein or Feinstein is the president likes to color or they could sewer for\nDefamation the problem is when you're suing somebody who's a public figure and if you happen to be a public figure as well\nAnd I think that Christine forwarded this point would be judged a public figure it becomes exceedingly hard\nTo bring any kind of a lawsuit you'd have to prove that a sort of Brett Kavanaugh I wanted to bring a suit against Dianne Feinstein he'd have to prove that what she said was untrue number one number two that she knew it was untrue when she said it because he is a public figure and number three\nSomebody that I Know of although I guess you could say the so called hate crimes are an effort\nTo do it at a very low level where if you use certain kinds of words you could be charged with a crime on the civil side somebody could suit Dianne Feinstein or Feinstein is the president likes to collar or they could sewer for\nDefamation the problem is when you're suing somebody who's a a public figure and if you happen to be a public figure as well\nAnd I think that Christine forwarded this point would be judged a public figure it becomes exceedingly hard\nTo bring any kind of lawsuits you'd have to prove that are sort of Brett Kavanaugh I wanted to bring a suit against Dianne Feinstein he'd have to prove that what she said was untrue number one number two that she knew it was untrue when she said it\nBecause he is a public figure and number three that she had actual malice that she said I'm going to get this guy with\nEven if I have to lie about it and I'm going to say things that are on true\nAnd I think you'd also lose out because in most defamation law that I'm aware of because as a reporter I've had to deal with lawyers for for like Thirty years on defamation laws when it comes to a public figure you have to show that you've actually suffered some dollar damages not just that you lost out on being a Supreme Court member which\nYou know usually pays less than what the private sector would\n... I don't think you'd be able to show dollar damages you wouldn't be able to prove that she knew it was untrue when she said it uh and in fact\nHow would you even go about saying that what Christine Ford is proven bully on true and and that means provable in court by a preponderance of the evidence first of all one of the biggest problems is proving something didn't happen because\nYou know I could I could say to you I could prove various things that I Do but how do I proved the\nThings I never did or disprove the idea that I did them that that it's hard in almost all cases so they're almost used in a civil or criminal solution to that and so and the Democrats know that they're using the full advantage let's go to Debbie\nAnd Debbie welcome to the Lars Larson ... what's on your mind\n[noise] hey Laurie I'm I just wanted to talk about ah the um\nMy cat and I guess my main concern is that um people are saying that he's not fit to be on the court because of his demeanor and ah I think that is so wrong because they are dealing with some personal I'm\nA attacks on him to personally and of course he shouldn't be angry especially if they're untruth who wouldn't stick out for themselves when you have patently false statements in front of the whole country set about use less awful things and\nUh but there is no way that but I think he was very right to stick up for himself if you don't do well\nAnd he had to be emphatic about it because he had ten people on the other side they couldn't say I couldn't say this guy was yellow and blue if it was a they couldn't tell the truth of their life depended on it and so he had to have\nA strong defense I mean gee that he's a lawyer he's a judge I mean\nThat's that bodes well in his defense\nBut I'm telling you that if he if he gets on the court I just looking at him I think he'd stare on us I think he's a dedicated to his profession or he wouldn't be where he is\nI think was the fact that he says this never happened\nBut now we want to know that if you wanted to do what they call arguing in the alternative which is some defense attorneys do where you say but if it were true that I did this thing in high school when it happened one time and never happen again how many of us would like\nAnd he had ten people on the other side they couldn't say I'm not a couldn't say the guy was yellow or blue if it was a they couldn't tell the truth that their life depended on it and so he had to have a strong defense I mean gee that he's a lawyer he's a judge I mean that's that\nBodes well and his defense\nBut I'm telling you that if he if he gets on the court I just looking at him I think he'd stare on it I think he dedicated to his profession or he wouldn't be where he is\nI think was the fact that he says this never happened but the way I Want to know that if you wanted to do what they call arguing in the alternative which is some defense attorneys do where you say but if it were true but I did this thing in high school when it happened one time and never happened again\nHow many of us would like to be judged professionally for one thing that happened one time Thirty years ago or ... something like this I think most people would say by that standard probably like the president had suggested today he says he knows a\nBunch of people on Capitol Hill from the Democratic party who are dirty themselves and

fifty sleep numbers stores nationwide visit sleep number dot com slash Lars to find the one near as few I'm going to bring on Michelle Owens who's an attorney and an expert on victim culture false allegations and attacks on due process not to mention title nine Michele welcome back to the program\nHi thanks for having me\nSo what is victim culture doing to America\nWell pretty much ruining it I mean you know you only have to look at what's going on with the judge Kavanaugh to say that um that we've created a victim culture where it is a an honor to be a victim is something to be tried for about\n... something to boast about and it's causing a lot of problems because when you're a victim you get a path for everything you don't have responsibility for whatever you did you know I made it back right on the class because still in the way you know I'm a victim\nSo it's it's causing a big problem and a lot of ways um and creating a whole generation of women of the victim is no one idea as a as a good thing\nI agree with you in fact we see people complimented on their courage for bringing a charged forward I Would imagine that\nYou know to the extent that Christine Ford believes what she said under oath last week let's assume she actually believes it whether it's true or not is another matter that she was you know she was congratulated on her courage for bringing forward\nShe knew that you would face a certain amount of\nPublic ah I guess negative reaction but she would also get an awful lot of positive reaction to not to mention some of the financial rewards that have already begun to begin to roll in in the form of about I think at last count about eight hundred thousand dollars into ago fun me account so there are negatives but there are positives as well\nBut she's congratulated because she had the courage to say you something about it she says this has trouble there for more than a third of the century and these other two accusers uh Debbie Ramirez\nWho doesn't entirely remember what exactly what happened at Yale University and then we of Julie sweating it apparently didn't NBC interview today\nIn which he began to back off of some of the claims that she had made she had said that you know Brett Kavanaugh and mark judge had spiked the punch to ah intoxicated young women children really and and to take sexual advantage of them will she's now backed off of that saying merely she saw cabinet off\nBy the punch bowl which I don't think is exactly an indictment but I mean literally she said well when asked by NBC News Monday whether she saw Kavanaugh slip substances into drinks which is what she said as recently as last week ... said she only witness to him by the punch well\nIf you say why is that a big deal if the FBI has been out to have a chat with her if she told a lie to the FBI that's criminally punishable so I'm Wondering if maybe that's the reason that her story is changing just a week later\n[noise] [noise] well I Wonder a lot about that and take politics out of it completely because I'm not looking at it I I Do title nine representation I represent males to our falsely accused of sexual assault every day that's what I did\nSo I see that when I look at it I don't see a political issue I see exactly what is happening\nTo the students I represent every day somebody makes a statement and they're the hero\nAnd they're the victim and the one with the courage to come forward and being a rape victim these days is an honor it's that bad you know where it's become that trend and it's really really concerning\nLie to the FBI that's criminally punishable so I'm Wondering if maybe that's the reason that her story is changing just a week later\nAs well I Wonder a lot about that and taking politics out of it completely because I'm not looking at it I I Do title nine representation I represent males to our falsely accused of sexual assault every day that's what I Do\nSo I see that when I look at it I don't see a political issue I see exactly what is happening\nTo the students I represent every day somebody makes a statement and they're the hero\nAnd they're the victim and the one with the courage to come forward and being a rape victim these days is an honor it's that bad you know where it's become the trend and it's really really concerning because first of all it destroys\nSo many lives of the ones they're accusing\nAnd what they're calling rape is no longer a the ... that's an issue of rape that we used to have and the criminal definition it's changed completely and they're taking away all the due process concern so I just thought the whole idea of it is\nFairly ridiculous and you know there's ... there's a cried\nThat goes with this victim mentality and I think that part of what is is\nSpring it on um it's it's kind of a silent pride that you know I'm a victim and therefore whatever I've done just grew up in my life is not my fault it is not my responsibility as someone else's it because they did that to me it is not on me\nYou know all the problems that I've had in any fault you can't throw it back on me because it's not my fault I'm a victim\nYou don't show it sounds like you're trembling me for the last Twenty years 'cause I remember Twenty years ago saying to a producer who happened to be a young lady I said to her I said I Need to\nFind my victim status today and she said what do you mean I said it seems that everybody who is a victim has status that that ordinary human beings do not have and she said well where would you find it and I said well\nLet's see when I was ten my mom was killed by a drunk driver I was in the car and I dragged her body out from under the car when my my father and I managed to get her out from under the car and I said so\nBy that standard I should have been a victim status that I can get away with just about anything except enough I I never\nThought of that as a way of saying well if I if I yell at one of my co workers I can say well you know my mom died when I was ten or if I drink too much alcohol I can say well my mom died when I was trying to another words every single\nThing I might do that somebody might object to I can say it's because my mom died when I was done I think my mom would reach down from heaven and slapped me upside the head if I did something like that because well I tell you to do\nBecause I mean I'm also a therapist and and I say that just to send it back up what I'm about to say but you know you go through life and the goal is not to be a victim as being a victim\nIt does to you it says her emotional growth and your growth as a person and what you're going to do in your life ...\nAnd ... he's a relationship everything so the goal is\nTo not be the victim and to help people recognize when they're being the victim and to snap out of it you know you don't really that's not really a real terms snap out of it but but seriously the kind of open your eyes and see that being a victim is not helping you it is hurting you it's and now we have this group of women\nThat are coming along and they're taking taking a moment with that but it's what they want to be as a victim I mean I've never seen anything like it it's really bizarre it's it's like a cult it puts a victim cults\nBut you know you go through life and the goal is not seeing them as being a victim\nIt does the it says you're emotional grass and your growth as a person and what you're going to do in your life\nAnd ... he's your relationship everything so they do is\nTo not be the victim and can help people recognize when they're being the victim and it's now out of it you know you don't really that's not really a real snap out of it that seriously they kind of open your eyes and said that thing is not helping you it is hurting you it's and now we have this group of women\nThat are coming along and they're taking\nIt taking with that it's what they went to the victims I mean I've never seen anything like it it's really bizarre it's it's like a call ... of them call\nAnd unfortunately as you point out when somebody begins to say if I don't perform as well at work or I Need to take more sick days where I couldn't finish my college degree\nIt's not because I wasn't studious enough it's because I'm a victim as opposed to saying you know and and we're all proud to those people who came back from World war two the greatest generation and they saw horrific\nBecause that's where it's been it's normal to do in that community and so when he decides to do something different it then become\nThat whole different ballgame\nWell for instance one of the quotes that stuck out at me and this is why I maybe I should have been watching Saturday Night live I was up past midnight on the west coast on Saturday Night I just didn't watch it I had to hear about it the next day but he said quote\nYou know it's like the plant the Democrats plan to take fathers out of the home and promote welfare does anybody know about that that's the Democratic plan and I thought I think he's right it's the same kind of thing I've said that you're really playing a trick on a whole generation or two\nWhen you say to young ladies if you have a baby you can have a ... as long as you don't get married and and provide a father for that trial of years\nThe government will send you a check and I just incentivize is marriage and cohesive families um\nThe w._b. ... boys\nUh you know back back in the day was a guy who pointed out that you you're in a largely intact black family structure in the early part of the Nineteen hundreds Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen twenty or thirty\nAnd it was largely intact and then in the sixties came along and the great society under Lyndon Johnson and they dismantled all of that I think for political reasons under ...\nAre a lot of these policies have been in place for so long these policies these this is so limited be Johnson is is that he's going to have the words loading a Democrat for the rest of the for the rest of your life do you think that these are the things that that that that the left is not a black a black people on the left on looks\nFather for that trial of years the government will send you a check and I just didn't send advisors marriage and cohesive families um\nThe w._b. ... boys\nUh you know back back in the day was the guy who pointed out that you you had a largely intact black family structure in the early part of the Nineteen hundreds Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen twenty or thirty\nAnd it was largely intact and then in the sixties came along and the great society under Lyndon Johnson and they dismantled all of that I think for political reasons under ...\nAre a lot of these policies have been in place for so long these policies\nThese this is some limited be Johnson that says that he's going to have the ... words loading a Democrat for the rest of the for the rest of your life do you think that happens these are the things that that that that the left is not a black a black people on the left on looking at their not\nThat no one is educating them that you have an doctor and the colleges were there and Dr ... where they're pushing all of the Democrat policies but then you have you know people who are\nThe generational ... a ... my parents were the demographic grandparents all Democrats I'm going to go to cry and what happens is Kanye West is saying that not enough if you don't have to vote with your parents or that you don't have to go for what people for what a\nFor what they do at the society says you must go you can be an individual huge a hard look drunk fool with your heart both but with your heart says don't just vote because it's popular vote Democrat\nAnd actually I think it'd be great if every group of voters instead of voting based on as you say skin color age or gender or whatever if every group played a little bit hard to get so if I'm going to vote for you the Democrat or you the Republican what are you going to do to make my family and my country better off\nAnd whichever party gives you the you know the the kind of policy that will actually produced that result you vote for them and if you voted along for a couple of cycles and they don't deliver you say hey I voted for you you didn't deliver I'm going somewhere else\nLarge my organization currently is what we're doing a national day of action for black conservatives all around the country but one thing that\nThe only thing is we're telling people is to make politicians work for your vote and I guarantee once we start was that starts to sit in the Democrats will not no longer have the power back because they haven't done anything I was in Chicago and I was met with people [noise] um\nI met with representatives on for it and some other individuals they said well I'll representatives on as soon as I follow the ultimate on answering the phone I said because that's because they already\nHave your vote because you've already given it to them and you won't voting thing they'll send you have been married to them and so they feel they don't have to work with like a marriage it's like a marriage when you had that honeymoon period and then added a honeymoon period they can just feel that they just do whatever they want to do because you're not going to get a divorce yeah that's how it is\nAnd and you know id onto that applies to men\nAnd women look I my wife does not take me for granted and I don't take her for granted we've been together for almost twenty five years and married for almost twenty three years now but we understand the minute you start to take the other one for granted you're really you're you're passing them the worst kind of insult you can throw him which has here here you're going to stick around I don't have to work hard\nAnd and my work hard I mean what can I Do today that will be good for my wife and good for my family and if she she should be thinking the same kind of thing\nI agree and that's the problem and so we have to change that we have to do it we have there has to be a new order best as Republican ... we have to simplify a message that we have to make sure that we're going into communities where Democrats aren't because they figure they don't have to go uh we have to go into these communities and we have to\nShare the Republican message that's why the black and sort of the federation for promoting economic stability education of asking that community involving three Republican principles in the African American community\nAnd we are pushing the conservative\nFor almost twenty three years now but we understand the minute you start to take the other one for granted you're really you're casting them the worst kind of insult you can throw it him which has fear here you're going to stick around I don't have to work hard\nAnd and my work hard I mean what can I Do today that will be good for my wife and good for my family and if she she should be thinking the same kind of thing\nI agree and that's the problem and so we have to change that we have do we have there has to be a new order best as Republican Party we have to simplify a message all you have to make sure that we're going into communities where Democrats aren't because they figure they don't have to go a we have to go into this community and we have to share\nThe Republican

yeah what about the world\nBoy Scout conference and they handed out a hundred thousand condoms six year old and what the hell is that you send your son to a boy scout convention and they're going to forgive them condoms\nRight well it's no longer the boy scouts anymore it can be any scale so look there is no limit and I and I'm telling folks forget about the the Muslims\nForget about the illegals

and it turned out that to your producer contacted me I said I Want to do Alex don't because I couldn't do that show before I Want people to understand that I'm not afraid to go on and have people go oh there's Kevin on Alex Jones bring it\nYou know look my story is my story it will be the same where wherever I go but I wanted to make your show for this reason\nAnd again they build strong men about me that aren't true until it might not come on the show is like the little comment about you but even though I was Charlie Manson you're allowed to only one shows you want to even threaten people don't interview Jones or will ban you 'cause he's so bad well wait I\nI mean I tell a Khamenei was interviewed about ... minutes what does this thing where you better not talk to somebody because they want to build a strong man and lie about what our shed and not have you heard of the real one that's why I ain't being censored\nIs not that I'm On on those platforms that now that I'm not on those platforms they can tell the most outrageous oh sure he lives in I Can't respond\nBut here's the good news and and I think from my perspective and pause possibly for years as well\nPeople know who I Am they say you know Kevin principles guy\nI didn't I didn't go try to hammer Fox after they let me go that's their prerogative and do what they want to do but I plan on making myself

I I guess here's my my my issue\nPresident Trump is called NAFTA the worst deal in the worst deal in history see if you can follow this one so President Trump has called NAFTA the worst deal ever made in history\nSo today what President Trump did was he made a few teeny little tweaks to NAFTA\nChanged its name\nAnd he called this the best deal in history\nAnd judging by what a lot of people are saying and conservative media\nThis is the greatest steel in the world when really all Donald Trump did\nWas make minor tweaks to NAFTA\nA trade agreement by the way that has needed up dating for a long long time\nAnd before we get into the deal that Trump announced today\nAnd this is the bigger issue with me\nSo many people have stopped thinking I saw this happen with Obama\nWhatever Brock Obama said people just room then failed to their knees and buy food and said you're the greatest my leader\nOwn leader leader lead me guide me you are the best\nPeople stop thinking anything Obama

today announced a new trade deal a new trade deal that needs to be approved by the United States Congress next year\nOr and if it's approved by the United States Congress and if Canada's in Mexico's legislative branches approved the trade deal it might go into effect not until twenty twenty understand that the new trade deals that Trump announced today\nOr is pretty much leaves pretty much almost all of NAFTA intact\nThat's an important point to make just show you're smart\nDonald Trump called NAFTA the worst trade deal ever okay what Trump's signed today or agreed to the day keeps almost all of that worst trade deal ever in\n... again I I don't know how you how you get there but it it'll work\nWith a lot of people look at the great deals he makes a quick look I'm again as John mentioned\nUh right now uh sixty two point five percent of every auto all auto components are built in North America must be from North America it bumps that up to Seventy five percent understand as well that's\nAlmost all of NAFTA intact\nThat's an important point to make just so you're smart\nDonald Trump called NAFTA the worst trade deal ever okay what Trump signed today or a green today keeps almost all of that worst trade deal ever in\n... again I I don't know how you how you get there but it it'll work\nWith a lot of people boom look at the great deals he makes a quick look I'm again is Sean mentioned\nUh right now uh sixty two point five percent of every auto all auto components are built in North America must be from North America it bumps that up to Seventy five percent understand as well that's going to make it more expensive to make cars here\nOr in the United states of America uh let's see what else he keeps intact\nUm what Canada wanted which is how to resolve disputes it opens up a limited\nA Canadian dairy markets to United States farmers um\nAnd then there are like just two or three other real mine are little provisions and it changes the name\nSo it's no longer called NAFTA\nNow what's called the United states Mexico Canada agreement\nBut its NAFTA\nLet me go to our hey are you around with Joe\nYeah good evening their jaw well this is just like the great the aware a Mr Kim I'm I'm you know kind of like getting a mix but he said yeah wait it out into a Trump bleed and then he's going to be back in business\nThat's that's the danger like you sit right are you say I just made a great deal but it really wasn't a deal\nNo no it's just like a bandage ah and then the [noise] [noise] yeah before and I uh\nYeah that's what I Do\nI Know a A R thanks it look I give them a lot of credit at least one hell of a salesman\nI'm just asking\nAll of us\nTo be more informed\nOr and before you go to bed tonight\nOr read an article or two about this\nNew trade agreement\nSo that you do know what was done and what wasn't done and so that you do know\nThat almost all of NAFTA is still intact\nI I guess that's my biggest beef is I don't like anybody to be a cheerleader\nI don't like cheerleaders on my side I don't like cheerleaders and the other side\nI like people who\nAre as informed as they can be and they push the issues they believe in hey let me go to Diane Diane you're on\nHi how are you\nHow are you Diane I'm fine how are you there good thank you\nChange a little better when I checked year level a I'm a college screener misty\nAnyway yeah she's a sweetheart\nWhen I'm getting at is with the\nSemi revised tenants is okay ... always try to be informed and\nLine one Ninety nine point nine percent politically active and listening to this\nSide I don't like cheerleaders on the other side\nI like people who\nAre as informed as they can be and they push the issues they believe in they let me go to Diane Diane Iran\nHi how are we looking at\nHow are you Diane I'm fine how are you there good thank you\nI may have changed a little bit of when I talk to your lovely 'em a call screener misty\nAnyway yeah she's a sweetheart\nSo

voted for ... not somebody that's going to count\nThem either way dying by the way by the way by the way down and you're right that's what I voted for I knew he was a street fighter and I I like I don't want to\nMake sure I'm saying is it the right now thirty six days before an election which organist where this country takes us is this country going to take us to wear 'em Republicans are going to say uh well you know because let's be honest I'm\nThe leftist which they have become the leftist and I kind of ... when you said last week good bringing out about this limited thing with a limited FBI in Tibet investigation shell cannot really that's not going to be they they protect every moral\nPerson they have and they're lying person that they had in their ... and the left okay so\nThis is what it comes down to and everybody listening to your show and this is what it comes down to hit thirty six day regardless of what this NAFTA thing I Do believe that President Trump is trying to get rid of the swamp and trying to\nLook for America Americans should be a sovereign nation now when we're looking at with the the the point is it the checks that faced leftist\nDianne Feinstein and I love it when he says Dianne Feinstein says at that that rupture so wrong and which I lock but\nIt it it ... out the window and they set a precedent that anybody could make an allegation\nI don't know

him to shine Mike statue and enjoy your day [noise]\nBack to the white man show\nThat was fun that first segment right there it's always nice to have somebody in the studio young millennial I Love the millennials my I had some kids I have four children they range in their mid thirties warm get no jet I'm getting oh wow yeah you are [laughter]\nThe mid ... I'm fifty six [noise] wow man time pat when you hit your fifties like the days like just go by so fast it's incredible when you're young you're like whoa man will will five o'clock every get here [laughter]\nYou get older it goes by fast it was a story I Want to talk about a little bit this morning about the block chain and proof of and not talk about this in real estate all the time because it makes a big deal so there's a lot of\nWork being done by the financial institutions when you put one trillion get this\nAll the financial institution you can go to my landing page the IT the Twenty one dot com and go down to the a chart number five fifty five on it with a big number five and look at the financial institutions there\nThat it put in one ... just this year and twenty Eighteen they've dedicated one trillion six hundred billion dollars\nJust for getting the block chain ready with their companies so that they can start you\nThe proof of and not talk about this in real estate all the time because it makes a big deal so there's a lot of\nWork being done by the financial institutions when you put one trillion get this\nAll the financial institutions you can go to my landing page the IT see Twenty one dot com and go down to the chart number five says five on it with a big number five and look at the financial institutions there\nThat I put in one ... just this year and twenty Eighteen they've dedicated one trillion six hundred billion dollars\nJust for\nGetting the block chain ready with their companies so that they can start\nUsing it with other companies for verification of all types of things specifically let's talk about the real estate industry today on this particular subject here so there's\nSome companies now that are starting to build with contractors because you know when you build you use phone phones a big\nPart of the insulation et cetera so every time they\nAre manufacturing these phone just like you would plywood a you know their cheat supply would you have sheets of phone they if she's the phone each one of them gets coated\nAnd so you when you build a house or a building or any type of structure you have so many code you have a code for each one of those pieces of phone that goes into the construction of that\nProperty whatever it is could be a shed could be a house could be a garage could be a commercial building ... or whatever it is to be a bridge [laughter]\nYou don't want bridges built with phone but you get the point of what I'm trying to say here has a code to it so the proof of location can be done by the code on that phone\nIt's pretty interesting stuff here because when you go to sell a house or any piece of property or by one anybody's ever bought one bought a piece of property a mini tide\nYou know that the paperwork is enough to make you want to go take a nap it'll drive you crazy and they have to do verification over verification over verification over verification\nYou sign a document after document after documented takes weeks sometimes even longer than that do verification\nWhat got loan doubt on it who owes on it are there any leans on it ... I mean it it's enough to drive you crazy well\nAll they can be done in a matter of minutes\nTo the block chain there's other countries matter of fact in Vegas where we that this last weekend people are selling homes for bitcoin\nYeah now last year and twenty Seventeen there was a story about it it was all over the news or at least in the local news is local news is is that a word News's [laughter]\nNow the other day I just made it one right [noise]\nYou know the all the so I say dumped them all of them don't be dum dum dum there's other things I say to but the ... Fox News now there's several anchors out there and see even CNN you hear monitors and dumped them then we made it popular\nCan you believe in that that's that's that's how they become a word you say them and then all of a sudden they become words right they get\nDo the block chain there's other countries matter of fact in Vegas where we that this last weekend people are selling homes for bitcoin yeah now last year and twenty Seventeen there was a story about\nIt it was all over the news or at least in the local news is local news is is that a word News's [laughter]\nNow the other day I just made it one right [noise]\nYou know the all the so I say dum dum all of them don't be a dum dum dum there's other things I said to but the ... Fox News now there's several anchors out there and see even CNN you hear him on there saying dump them then we made it popular\nCan you believe in that that's that's that's how they become a word you say them and then all of a sudden they become words right they get used by everyone and it's yeah and the dictionary event him ... in the dictionary bitcoin just became a monopoly word\n... which is pretty big deal that's a big deal a lot of people play or not monopoly is not what's that word Scrabble Scrabble Scrabble monopoly became a Scrabble word [laughter]\nIsn't that crazy yeah it's yeah it's new words coming up all the time anyway I say dumped him all the time it's okay to be a dum dum you don't really want to be a dump them\nIt's not it's not going to be done yet to educate I like to say edging McKay yet to educate yourself [laughter]\nAnyway but this is a proof of purchase a were being a little silly today I Am the rain doesn't right I don't know how far you drove in today but ah I drove from the reservation out there\nYou know we're enterprise is right where that when the rise will get another another three or four miles into Iraq and what you're talking yeah it's crazy driving in it was about ... backed up miles the traffic just to get to the freeway and I don't take the freeway I go down the middle of the city and I cut off literally thirty forty five minutes driving\nYeah I'm not that dumb [laughter]\nI might be a fat little Indian but I'm not that dumb anyway this is let's get back to the phone so we're talking all the time about\nThe real estate and be able to make the transaction and clothes on a piece of property real quickly\nThis is bitcoin the block chain companies that do smart contracts that ... they're called disruptive the reason they're disruptive as it is because it's going to change things for the better it's not a bad thing it's a good thing could you imagine closing on a house in one day\nYou ever bought a house that'd be phenomenal yeah it would be incredible to be able to go here's the pay ... who's her hair all the verification gets done of war the loans anybody has any leans on it ... who owns the property whereas the property\nWho are who owns the title who was the loans\nEtcetera it's all done and it can be tracked by the building materials are starting to use that now on the phone it's pretty crazy they can verify almost everything just from that far who the contractor was who bought it\nIncredible then they can go back to the contracts that who the contractor was who the sub contractors were where the plight supply houses who sold it I mean it is incredible what the\nBlock chain is going to do to expedite verification of in this case a piece of property [laughter] pretty incredible so there's a story out over they're starting to use it in the Ukraine\nWhich is an ally of ours in Russia which is not an al ally of ours but the block\nChain doesn't carry didn't know nothing about who who's friendly to us and who isn't right all the does the assimilate this that's the right word\nIt's all done and it can be tracked by the building materials are starting to use that now in film it's pretty crazy they can verify almost everything just from that folks who the contractor was who bought it\nIncredible then they can go back to the contracts that who the contractor was who the sub contractors were where the plight supply houses who sold it I mean it is incredible what the\nBlock chain is going to do to expedite verification of in this case a piece of property [laughter] pretty incredible so there's a story out over they're starting to use it in the Ukraine which is an ally of ours in Russia which is not an out ally\nOf ours but the block chain doesn't care it didn't know nothing about who who's friendly to us and who isn't right all the does the uh simulates if that's the right word to use it just puts out the information that's all it does it verified information which allows you to make\nA purchase or a transaction or a verification and it does it fast that's why those of you who don't invest in bit cornered don't know about it yet or it's they it's a scam you don't need to get started doing some in for my study on it\nAny way this is a great way because what they are starting to use in other countries where they verify property\nThe so there was some stories out and I did it or last week I talked about it where they are starting to verify property within hours literally what normally takes some times a week two weeks to verify for you can even get close to closing on a house\nYou're looking at a a matter of hours literally they closed on a piece of property in one day\nWhich is pretty incredible problem with that is just so I had to have a hard time when people not even comfortable using right yeah it's it's is way ahead of our way ahead of our time its way out of our time but it's coming it's like this\nNow you're too young to remember this there was a show back in the day called get smart I think it was called get smart you is that was the name of that jet get smart something like that\nWere done at um yeah yeah where he had the radio in his shoe yeah so we had a ... year that it was a secret agent who was a secret agent any pull off his shoe need dial the number you're too young for this and he would talk into his shoe like a cell phone like a phone yeah people going that's never going to is that we loved it but people use to go\nThat's never going to happen and then we had cell phones Twenty years later it's incredible so you're right we ... people don't trust because they freak out that something could actually be true\nYou know it's just like no way this can be true but it's just the evolution of and this is why I talk about bitcoin being deflation airy instead of inflation or you know what causes inflation\nA printing money printing money causes inflation that out in the values the money okay the reason that bitcoin an crypto currency ballistic the bitcoin is deflation area would you know that answer or anything about that um 'cause it's limited it's\nIs one is this is one of the greatest trade deals made in our history\nSo you guys got to get out there and study this gang because there there's a lot to this now most people don't realize is too is there's ... there were one of the reasons that we find all of our a lot of our manufacturing out to China and some of these other Asian hold on I'm going to snake\n[laughter] like to thank you why is because there's\nA lot of the minerals they outlawed it that we cannot mining here in the United states we have some of the richest minerals in the world here in the United states were not allowed to mind that it's against the law and the mind some of these minerals that do do what I'm Talking about minerals that makes some of the metal products that are in these phones then I'm holding up right here\nSome of the minerals that make even the everything that has to do with the washing machines refrigerators sewing machines irons anything with metal in it there are certain metals that were not allowed to mind here against the law you cannot even own it so we had to ship\nOut all these manufacturing jobs to other countries were going to do a show on that and I see the lights going on you tell a millennial something the lights go on and they start thinking that do you guys are way Henry your times I Hope you know this you don't know this maybe they're not probably do your [laughter]\nYour way ahead of your time you don't most people I don't think no it\nBut anyway you you guys are way ahead of your time's over here because you know especially when you're doing everything online these days right I mean who wants to do you have a bank account yeah yeah do you keep most of it there do you keep in mind though that some of this kind of personal\nBut do you use as much off line or excuse me off banking like um the un banked do where you take your money out of the bank and put it on line you're putting in wallets [noise] what do you do with your money\n... about twenty percent of it you're investing towards helping America hope you're listening to this\nYou're investing about twenty percent of it so that for twenty percent goes good tax advantage to do that too by the way right yeah and then uh do leave a ... a percentage in the bank or do you do online wallets where you are you using your walls at all or you are you're keeping everything cold storage\nOr your boss you both yeah okay\nAnd what about ah with spending like when you go to Starbucks you pay it if you want to pay something you use your online wallets are using like an app for that are in my youth everything on line everything on line yeah OK rarely have cash on me rarely have cash yeah okay\nAll right so you're keeping limited amounts in the bank yeah definitely damp hope you're listening to this America\nWallets [noise] what do you do with your money\n... about twenty percent of it you're investing twist hope America hope you're listening to this\nYou're investing about twenty percent of it so that for twenty percent goes good tax advantage to do that too by the way right yeah and then uh do leave a ... a percentage in the banks or do you do online while it's where you are you using your walls at all or you are you keeping everything cold storage\nI lost you both yeah okay\nAnd what about uh with spending like when you go to Starbucks or you pay it if you want to pay something you use your online wallets are using like an app for that or I use everything on line everything on line yeah OK rarely have cash on me rarely have cash yeah okay\nAll right so you're keeping limited amounts in the bank yeah definitely damp hope you're listening to this America okay and this is a Abdul for those you don't know he's a very successful young man you got a full time job right correct full time job and\nYou're a big one I think I can say this right you're absolutely an investor and you're also a by ... points for people right [laughter] right and so like you're a bitcoin broker buyer broker right correct in the big one we're not anything those securities but over here in the crypt the world right yeah and you're twenty five yeah [laughter]\nOh boy that's pretty awesome anyway we're going to have you on the show more often okay it's pretty exciting by adding to have a young people on who are successful by the way this\nYoung man right here ah in full disclosure is doing work with this too he he works with me to write in the um so we're in um we're doing some projects together but this guy's going to be a holding a billion dollar portfolio before it's over it's just a matter of time right the more you collect\nThe more the value goes up just the way it works the progression you're only twenty five by the time you get to be my age if you continue what you're doing you know you're going to billions of dollars in your ... I'm all about that long term yeah long term okay and that's good to know so let's get back to the deflation area 'cause I didn't want to draw I Would really want to draw this point now\nSo because there is no um when you're printing money and you have all the overhead that goes with it to not only your printed you distributed you have everybody managing it you have all the overhead with the buildings the\nThe retirement plans you have the insurance you have the the everything that goes with the ... income for people to manage all this because the more you have out there the more people got to manage it right\nAnd and that that's where the inflation goes the cost of living goes up et cetera et cetera as we go on when you get the more that you build the economy the more the inflation goes up you have you're going to have inflation there Kay but with the money here that's on line because it's deflation or you don't have any of that overhead\nThat's a huge huge savings just at not only because you don't have to print it is it and it's limited\nBut you don't have all the overhead that goes with the two there isn't that part of the nobody even thinks about [laughter]\nThe big smile alike that there's a lot to think about it and it it is there's there's so much that goes on hey Cameron\nI gotta tell this camera tell us a call them back\nIn the morning I'm On the radio show

I was kind of done this before in order to be ended up past lives in various stages but\nBeing a in the senior housing business friendship retirement corporation that I'm not for profit in town\nIs we thought that in part of our presidents in terms of what we're doing with everybody aging in place in Arizona is one of the big retirement public places in the country where people come to various other parts of the country to retire and live and and you know live because the sunshine and today the rain right um\nWe wanted to give through we want to do something more because the conversation is

senior dementia series [noise]\nShelley we were talking about um the training before the before the break John\nTell us why you I'm not sure who's gonna might I ask ... why are you from your experience why do you think that education is always ... important in on this particular topic\nWell first stop on the topic we we feel like educating our first responders\nIs important because we we can see how we're gonna handle a combative dimension patient mhm it's important for us because we're right now we go into a scene and joined I were talking about this as well just how we're coming in with more\nMen and women on track and that might be too much for a patient grants to take him yeah absolutely so some of the training that she was explaining to me how we bring in one person in the beginning\nAnd try to de escalate the situation to be really beneficial just that type of meditation for us the things that we need to know\nTell us why you I'm not sure who's going to mind I was getting at is why are you from your experience why do you think that education is always ... important in on this particular topic well\nFirst off on this topic we we feel like educating our first responders is important because we we can see how we're gonna handle a combative dimension patient [laughter] it's important for us because we're right now we go into a scene and shy and I were talking about this as well just how we're coming in with four\nMen or women on track and that might be too much for a patient out to trick him yeah absolutely so some of the training that she was explaining to me how we bring in one person in the beginning and try to de escalate the situation to be really beneficial just that type of meditation for us the things that we need to know\nWe're constantly learning in our industry and we're always looking for opportunities to learn new ways to approach called new ways to handle certain situations and\nTo be honest with you this particular subject is kind of new to us we deal with dementia patients all the time but we're more or less just dealing with the the medical side of what's going on not treating the dimension but treating some other elements on honor something medically with him or if he hurt himself him or herself\nAnd we go in there that's what we're dealing with however ...\nYeah and that's what I meant earlier when I said you go in there as though it's anybody and everybody but in fact it's it's a very different situation because while they may have a medical issue there are also still dementia you know they also still have to ...\nAnd I see where this training could really dial us in a little bit sharper and be able to handle these calls in a little bit different perspective and I'm encouraged by it and I feel like the education will be a really good for us and I believe all first responders will feel the same I agree\nAnd you know I'm I'm hoping that you are hoping that your answer is going to be because you guys are first responders are trained to handle the margin season general 'cause it seems to me\nThe getting this kind of training if you lose your paramedic or somebody that is used to every situation almost being different again that the behaviors peace can really be crucial for first responders and that just like me when I ah I've had CPR first day training which we have to carry in our business\nAnd yet the when I see myself in a restaurant or something's happening\nThe reaction time 'cause you don't do it every day you have to say okay what are the steps but that then the person to be having all kinds of problems right so do you find that because of the training for the dementia piece is so much more broad but you don't know exactly what you're dealing with because you maybe don't know what you're dealing with\nWell that you make a good point with that I'm not sure\nIf we look at the broad perspective of dementia when we're approaching a hall because we're more or less really focused on what were called what's the emergency what's the American so we're dealing with that and we just go right in and we and we do our protocols when we are addressed the calls just like we normally do\nOn a day to day but you bring up CPR that's a that's a good a good example of how even CPR has evolved over time and over here ... we're not continue educating ourselves\nAnd looking at these\nCalls that we that can seem redundant mhm we need to step back really think about what we're doing to get some education on some of these types of subjects and make a better difference in our community migraine ...\nSo you have to training is coming up on October eleventh and when it's on the twelfth I have a couple of questions about that why two events and what are the differences between the two training and will benefit from each training\nDo our protocols when we uh address the call just like we normally do on a day to day but you bring up CPR it's a good a good example of how human CPR has evolved over time and over years were not educating ourselves and looking at these\nCalls that we that can seem redundant mhm we need to step back really think about what we're doing a gift from education on some of these types of subjects and then make a better difference in our community migraine ...\nSo you have two trains coming up on October eleventh and one is on the twelfth I have a couple of questions about that why two events and what are the differences between the two trains and who will benefit from each training\nOn ... I think that the reason why there's two different events and who's going to be benefiting from those is because the first responders really need to be trained in a different environment\nAs we were looking at these two events we came to understand that particularly when you're talking about police officers you can't mix the police officers with the general public are\nOur police officers are under the microscope every single day and they can't make a single mistake and so they can't even to admit that they need training so when you put them in a training situation they need to be able to be separate from the public\nSo putting them in a separate environment where they can be vulnerable and be able to admit what they need to understand\nAway from the public gives them that opportunity on their own turf ... to be able to understand what it is that dimension to this dimension training will offer them\nAnd then it also gives him that opportunity to be able to ask questions without the public scrutiny gives them that opportunity to understand what is the difference between depression schizophrenia\nAnd dementia [laughter] it really it gives them that opportunity to truly dive in to that difference\nAnd then the the second training gives that family caregiver and their professional caregiver an opportunity to get the hands on training that they need\nSo don't really have to do the ... other first responders ... sometimes I hear what your show to vote\nIn a safe space for the first responders like firemen and police officers yes but doesn't the first responder on the family side for the greater potential seeing some of these really challenging behaviors before nine one one is called I mean what are we missing\nBut I ... isn't the second event for family members\nDid it it sounds like a second event it's for and members so they're getting the same training he goes to the same dream it is the same training the only difference is is rather than mixing the two groups together\nSo when I'm when Dr ... will be speaking that she's going to be giving the same type of training but the language she will be using will be slightly different with the first responders than it will be for the family caregiver there\nA public safety Pete's that is the primary focus for first responders where the scene has to be safe for them so when they're approaching if we have an officer approaching somebody with dementia that's got a concern or not of aggression going on\nI'm just approaching them where they're done is behind them so they come in sideways not directly to them but from the side that makes a big difference how we're approaching them and\nSo it's a little bit different like Carey was saying with regard\nSo it's the same dream it is the same training the only differences as rather that mix the two groups together\nSo when I'm when Dr ... will be speaking the she's going to be giving the same type of training but the language she will be using will be slightly different with the first responders then it will be for the family caregiver there is a\nPublic safety piece that is the primary focus for first responders where the scene has to be safe for them so when they're approaching if we have an officer approaching somebody with dementia that's got a concert or a matter of aggression going on\nI'm just approaching them where they're done is behind them so they come in sideways not directly to them but from the side that makes a big difference how we're approaching them and so\nIt's a little bit different like Carey was saying with regard to the terminology that we're dealing with because we're going to be talking about the public safety peace first mhm and then\nThe other piece where it's really more about the client or the resident or a loved one that we're talking about so same material taught a little bit different but um both very very powerful\n... crazy question here it only because I have trees you questions it seems like [laughter]\nUm I understand the significance of the first responder to understand the ... the public safety peace or really do but also understand that I'm having been the business that shows you the behaviors are really a challenge in our memory care units and they're all different endings and manifest themselves differently\nGod only knows when right yes\nSo is it is a training for the challenging behavior enough that some of these behaviors can be ... be can be mimics so that people understand what you're looking at number one yes and then the second part of it is\nWhen you when caregivers call and maybe a ... question more ready to quit to anybody else\nIs do necessarily when there's caregivers and homeless ... or a loved one family member taking care of it\nDo they necessarily always say that their that their loved one has a ... is is it has an old timers memory care like a problem I I mean he's ... he's having a heart attack they're not seeing that necessarily correct\nAnd my I that's true I didn't even that's a great question\nThat is true we get called out on call we don't know their history their medical history it's\nOne of the first question that we ask because obviously is pertinent information that we need to know however on a dimensional patient\nWe would not be going in there and treating the patient any differently because they have the metro or don't have the men were treating the reason why we're called out whether a\nBroken arm falling hit their head right seizure heart attack it could be a Mariel they're usually right that a judge it but it's important to know that they had dementia because other things that we look at is there\nThere are they aware and alert and I know where they're at and they won't answer questions appropriately we might misdiagnose what is going on so okay but if we realize they have dementia and they're acting answer and where will ... will be\nMore so can I ask a question really my Mike has this ... I I mean I Know that as you were saying earlier that this is fairly new you know kind of information and and dealing with this but ... does that information help you when you get a call if if he were to get that information that said\nSo okay but if we realize they have dementia and they're acting in a room where will ... will be\nMore so can I ask that question really can't do this and I I mean I Know that as you were saying earlier that that's a fairly new you know kind of information and and dealing with the guys that information helped you when you get a call if if you were to get that information that said\nWell there's a lot of options out there actually now with technology for those who aren't able to travel the families have been setting them up on the website Facebook has some amazing um groups that allow them to communicate their frustrations their challenges and everybody that sharing their experience so actually that's where technology comes into the picture for\nFor that type of support and then there's also a lot of people that have been grouping together and said listen you know we're all dealing with the same thing why don't we plant every Tuesday Morning we're going to the support group and even some facilities that are holding that support groups will offer transportation for that\nSo if there is a desire we will find a way to offer that support one way or another looting\nFinding somebody to maybe ... for a couple of hours that's right 'cause I I think to me that's important yes I think you know we get we've gotten so technologically oriented in our society and we use a two dimensional vehicle as a crutch and there's something to be said for having that\nThree dimensional conversation to get his heart of the matter and you're\nYou're absolutely correct and that the facility and oftentimes offer the daycare program so they can bring their loved one with them while they're getting the support that they need and that is critical because caregivers are burning out understandably\nAnd unfortunately the over sixty percent or the caregivers you know they're they're ending up having their own medical challenges as well and two hundred and thirty two billion dollars of unpaid caregivers so\nWhat we're seeing is that the family caregivers are providing care for\nOur loved ones they're having to quit their jobs they don't have the support they don't have the knowledge they're thrown into that ... well what do we do um and I I actually have a family I'm helping in their house is going into foreclosure because they don't have those resources\nAnd resources anymore great post a ton of money yeah so how does the increase in the senior population in general\nAffect public services\nLike the um emergency services one moment that we talked about 'em but also just in general ... services to or seniors 'cause it seems like we're already struggling to even get to the button you know the bottom rung of that particular ladder and this has got to be making things a lot tougher all the way around\nIt was true ah I learned from Kerry earlier today that we have fifty seven group homes and communities right within the first two of one of our our stations so we're seeing an increase them and the elderly population much population where lesson lots where they driving or or not\nAnd I I actually have a family and helping in their house is going into foreclosure because they don't have those resources\nHave your sources anymore clay post a ton of money yeah so how does the increase in the senior population in general\nAffect public services\nLike the emergency type services among ... we talked about 'em but also just in general is services to war seniors 'cause it seems like we're already struggling to even get to the button you know the bottom rung of that particular ladder and this has got to be making things a lot tougher all the way around\nIt was true ah I learned from Kerry earlier today that we have fifty seven group homes and communities right within the\nFirst do of one of our our stations so we're seeing an increase in and the elderly population much population were\nLess and less where they driving or or or not traveling anymore so that keeps them here and the and the valley well throughout the year and then also less a snow birds and mhm we used to in the past we see a significant difference in a winter called versus or some recalls\nNot anymore now we have a steady flow of calls it's it's more consistent throughout the year and it is increasing you know it is a concern of ours however training like this could help the caregivers caregivers\nDeal with these patients in a different manner and maybe alleviate from having to activate the nine one one system\n... or ... specific question you only because I think some people lose their wheels attorney like mine said what what station or you can put it purely number one\nHe Oreo one Ninety One\nWhen the only ones that are stationed fifty seven group homes and your station in over that'd be Peoria fire station one Ninety two one Ninety two so in an area so to give people ideas house help is available\nWhat kind of geographic area would stay you would cover station one Ninety two that has fifty seven group homes is like a five mile square is that Fifteen minutes away to ...\nApproximately two miles of our first do however we don't\nWe're all on automatic ... so we don't have any boundaries mhm with our first do can grow if say one Ninety three is on a call right right Ninety three are going to call that means when I Need to first do not around and that just happens up and down all day long and then on the call volume about what's going on or how many people are what's going on in the valley so\nYeah so are our first do but it's we have this many communities or that's what I often a juvenile airhead for example it's one of the higher ones and okay and the city of Peoria but valley wide we have any kind of\nA that\nIt's hard gee I there is a number but I did not pull the number but I Do know that in Glendale there is a station has eleven communities in their first do area\nSo if you think about how many seniors are in just those communities [laughter] I mean think about how many community how many seniors are just in your community and loan and then you take your community and granted Glenn cross is a large community but if you take your community and multiply that by\nYou know just for that a lot of seniors in a concentrated area and so if that fire station or that fire truck is going out into your community that takes them\nOut of service so that they can no longer go on calls in another area that you had ten communities in one area\nThat's a lot of calls that they're going on\nAll the all the more reason to have good communication right because sometimes a matter of moments can make a difference between having access to somebody somebody else to do that needs to help\nAnd that's the purpose of this training\nGood yeah absolutely\nCommunity how many seniors are just in your community long and then you take your community and granted Glenn cross is a large community but if you take your community and multiply that by\nYou know just for that a lot of seniors in a concentrated area and so if that fire station or that fire truck is going out into your community that takes them\nOut of service so that they can no longer go on calls in another area so if you have ten communities in one area\nThat's a lot of calls that they're going on\nAll the all the more reason to have good communication right because sometimes a matter of moments can make a difference between having access to somebody somebody else to do that needs to help and that's the purpose of this training\nYeah absolutely so we have to take another break here and just a moment but I Want you to be thinking about how can these types of training sessions affect public service from a customer service point of view and from a financial point of view might that'll be you when we come back\n[laughter] you're listening to except for latent on independent ... cafe next and when we return we are going to continue this conversation you're done and want to sign up for this training can we'll be right back [laughter]\n\nOr you or someone you know what sorts of high quality

Everett Robert welcome back to the show friends what is it that\nDrives you the most I mean since you started did you did you see yourself accelerating your goals Robert [noise] you've always been a you've always been aggressive um since I've known your you've always been someone out there say they\nYou know I'm number one I'm going to be number one and you're going to have to be number two because I'm already number one\nYou better that way but you you've accelerated your goal since I've seen you did you know you were doing that it said something consciously you did or didn't just happen to be on how you jak yourself up to get up and work harder every day and the less everyday once you're successful\nYou know I don't want to live or regret though at the number one I don't want to be you know eighty nine years all you know and I don't know of any of my ... America somewhere but\nI don't want to be sitting there thinking regret to me that just seems like a horrible way to say that they would they why did not do it why did I Hope that person why did that go over here\nWhy not change my mind that white Knight shoot for higher you know and it's it's just\nI don't want to live that and so that it did I think the federal theme along the way I think I've read you know end up you know associated myself with different you know people you find on on you know faith or social media types of people are written books on the on the power of yourself and trying to get your thing you know you're you're the best out of you and you know\nBut do you how do you check yourself up to get up and work harder everything's that less than we do once you're successful\nYou know I don't want to live a regret though at the number one I don't want to be you know eighty Ninety years all you know and I don't know if I'll be in my tattered from nursing home somewhere but\nI don't want to be sitting there thinking regret to me that just seems like a horrible way to exist to think why did not do this why didn't I Hope that person why did not go over here\nWhy not changed my mind so why not shoot for higher you know and it's it's just\nI don't want to live that and so that has been I think the central theme\nAlong the way I think I've read you know end up you know associated myself with different\nYou know people you find on on you know Facebook social media types and people were written books on you know the power of yourself and trying to get your thing you know you're you're the best out of you and you know it's always go back to an example I was a gentleman in Grand car down with maybe hoping somebody you've heard of um he's a he's a sales\nA motivator cells coach got started in the in the\nCar business first ah and they got in a real thing and he wrote a book called panic and it and it basically the book was\nUm how much money as you know he had the example you ask somebody how much money is a lot of money and how many people would say a million dollars or five million dollars and that is that's a really big number but that to our toys to the child or to the family of somebody worth hundreds of millions of dollars is that really a big number\nAnd so when he was thinking what you need the ten extra way of thinking you got to change your mindset right because you're only going to go as far as your mind going to let you go and so instead of choosing one million why they choose ten million how can they didn't choose a hundred million I'm In Philly ... the concept is is uh that that you just got to be able to shoot higher because of your goals\nAren't aren't scaring you\nAnd they're not big enough you're not going to achieving at the very most out of yourself so I think that was one of the books that I think I read\nSome time back that maybe a few three four years ago that really woke me up and realize wait a minute you've got disability you're building this machine that's like you know being able to operate these apartment complexes and generate tens of concept for the investors you know be able to provide for for for yourself and your team why aren't you know giving up a little bit you you you can do it\nYou know do I think you've done the same thing I mean when I joined the business you know when I drove through your group you know you weren't nearly as\nMassive as you are today now you're all across the country now you've got offices everywhere you guide member from multiple countries and and you know nearly every state in the country and I mean doing all these great things all because of what they learned their lifestyles right but somewhere along the way you decided you want to rent but up right\nSo I think it's a similar system under a a concept\nSo Robert [noise] as you as you look at this thing and you're you're producing this result\nAnd you talk about legacy not want to leave behind something less than what you could have left behind how do you bring your children is and what age I I mean I don't know how old your children do you get a couple of guys\nBut um how do you see bringing up kids into this\nI my my boys are everything to me I've got a twelve year old and I've got one that just turned ten they're really crazy good soccer players\nUm but what I think I've been able to do for them is that you know like my mom did for me they have an expectation to when they have an expectation to fight they have an expectation to to scrape and do what they're going to have to do and so I think the business I'm you know a has brought that out of me to another level\nYou know I'm constantly wondering when I'm when we're I pick them up for soccer practice I had a day of work I go get them every day I take my kids' soccer every time I don't miss that as often as I can I don't think I don't miss very many games either I'm and I'm worried that car and when I get them I ask them how their day is going and we didn't talk about it and then it's march or how to how\nRon where you've got a couple of guys but um how do you see bringing up kids into this\nMan I ... my boys are everything to me I've got a twelve year old and I've got one that just turned ten they're really crazy good soccer players\nUm but what I think I've been able to do for them is that you know like my ... for me they have an expectation to when they have an expectation to fight they have an expectation to to scrape and do what they're going to have to do and so\nThink the business I'm you know a has brought that out of me to another level\nYou know I'm constantly wondering when I'm when we're I pick them up for soccer practice that had a day of work I go get them every day I take my kids' soccer every time I don't miss that as often as I can I don't think I don't miss very many games either I'm and I'm worried that car and when I get them I ask them how theyre days one\nAnd we didn't talk about it and then it's march or how how's it going with me and we sit down there and I had business ... business conversation with him I tell them what's going on I'll go do you understand what I just said do you understand why that's important they repeat it back to me\nYou know where it it just so much fun when you when you have a conversation with him one day and a week or two later they're like hey that means this and this and that and like yeah that's exactly what\nYou know so it's like what did you start lobbied I Love\nI'm Sorry what age did you start teach more wouldn't like that the question was what am I going on for as long as\nThey could yeah I I Would say maybe I mean we have conversations all the time I think they Saudi ramped up it wasn't designed like I'm a business that I I I think uh\nYou know it's probably been there since they are like five six or seven probably where they could really understand it and it's like okay so you understand that daddy owns these buildings right here right he's like yeah yeah you know understand why that's important and we go into the concepts\nPaying rent and working for your money and how viable money is and how you had to have somewhere to live in and just you know be able to to to expand the benefits as well you know of owning a piece of real estate you know and so it's like they they get it I mean I I have no doubt\nI'm growing up that they're ... they're going to have a will to want to work with me I'm In the future I don't think I think this is you know way I I Do it myself I Want to go I thought I wanted to work a lot of ... I mean who ... boy doesn't want to go work with that [laughter] I Know I Want to work up all over to my dad was a you know\nMy dad was always like you know you're not going to do like a white because this is a good enough for you you need to shoot higher\nLike wow really they are yeah yeah\nYou know what would that it's okay you know when he said we can on a store and all that and and he was like no no you go find your own path you know you so I'm curious to see how that's going to play on the future I Would love to have them in the business but you know it we're going to have to see how how the cards\nA stack up later on I'm curious to see if if ah if I push them away way my dad did they can you can do bigger and beyond or but I think that they're going to be the continuation of of of what of what our company is and and the and the likely behind it\nCan I see a president Martinez Sunday during my hearing we want to have\nKnow it's all funny you ... it it was so funny you said that right because I think you know I I've got one that has so much swag right and he's got so much confidence and he just like man I think that's on especially when he's going to be president of the states where he's going to run a prison gang one or two I haven't figured it out\nBut he just got so he could just inspiring he's like you know the leader of people in his little school right that I could totally see him in that capacity the other one is very straight arrow\nSo funny you said that right because I think you know I've got one that has so much swag right and he got so much confidence and he just like that I think that's what he said they're going to be president that states where you're going to run a prison gang one or two I figured it out\nBut he just got so he could just if fire and he's like you know the leader of people and it's a little school right that I could totally see him in that capacity the other one is very straight arrow\nVery like by the book doesn't have as much creativity you know I'm a just a either good soldier he's going to go do exactly what I mean do you ... you know I'm so it's really really funny you said that I could always be\nYou know you've told me many times you had to completely re learn the business can you share that with people what you had to go through to to\nTotally ... a different situation ever run into for\nFor sure how much time do I have left out on this or you got six minutes\nOkay perfect okay so I was wondering that's the example you're listening to you know when you're asking for like something though that you know I\nDon't actually I actually was it Robert I wasn't thinking of that's kind of guy who wasn't okay I I don't consider the solutions which which I considered one of the turning point to your career where you will Olson stuff ... view that I'd never heard before\nYou know for sure I I think finally class the deal you know reaching you know it goes above and beyond the model model\nIt's by working class property being the property you know buy properties where my mom was the same as most everybody else as well just some some refinement here and there but we're going to fix anything that's going to break or the next five years we're going to make sure that there's no reason to move out right we're going to take care of all the air conditioner because that's the number one maintenance headache and if you're residents\nIf it's not eighty six degrees in their apartment in August and it's a cause Seventy two they're more than likely to renew right and we make our money in the renewal game so it's it's a you know that process it's a little bit different\nWhen you're going through in a market where everything's already knew right where where if they can afford the rent level at that number than to than they can afford the written that written that rent number at other similar properties which are also knew so I think the the the business model\nOf you know fixing everything that's broke in and get into a new rule is very different in the eight market um I I think I think you have to it's it's much more\nUm there's a higher emphasis on leasing leasing anything because you're you're dealing with people who have more options money gives you watch it if you a lack of money that they give you often if you haven't plenty of discretionary income and you can ... can pay rent or you can choose to buy a house when you're ready or you can choose to move to a different part of town\nYou know you're not locked in I think one of our business models also depended on the schools that that that we that we uh we we we like to buy in the suburbs so school but school districts are very important to us you know families to win three bedrooms right\nI think this property that I'm that we we'd have sold recently you know there was a eighty percent one bit do just that there's a there was a lack of two bedrooms\nProperty which are also knew so I think the the the business model of you know fix and everything that's broken in and get into a new rule is very different in the a market um I I think I think you have to it's a it's much more\nUm there's a higher emphasis on leasing leasing he think because you're you're dealing with people who have more options money gives you often have you a lack of money that they give you often if you haven't plenty of discretionary income and you can be can pay rent or you can choose to buy a house when it ... or you can choose to move to a different part of town\nYou know you're not locked in I think one of our business models also depended on the schools that that that we that we uh we we like to buy in the suburbs so school to school districts are very important to us you know family is two and three bedrooms right\nI think this property that I'm that we we just sold recently you know there was a eighty percent one bit do just that there's a there was a lack of two bedrooms right and was really interesting the Tibetans were always full rights I don't know why they just didn't do it more choose but um you have more one death which means you have more than a nomadic more of a\nUm ... not I don't know transit coming up anywhere but you know more of a of a of a of a demographic that's going to move quicker than the younger crowd right so as a ... as a you know young people want to meet people that want to couple up they want it\nTo to get married and moved out to the verbs right so I think the model we had to learn we had a um\nWe had we had to play with a model on the fly which um I didn't ... I thought we would go in there and be the low cost a provider\nWhich you know I think whatever occurred I think we got caught in the economics\nOf the economy and what was changing you know when we were doing it on a writing on that deal\nOr it was a hundred dollars a barrel only by finally get into the property a few months later we're at Seventy dollars a barrel by December of that year with sixty dollars a barrel ... a year later an hour at forty dollars a barrel so you know where we had all this monster job growth now we had lost her job law\nAt the same time we had sixty thousand brand new units coming to market which were also planning that hundred dollar oil sticking around and we're all kind of playing with a broad trying to fight for a a reduced or diminishing rental population so what we learn you know all that just use the back or what we learned we had a market much better\nThat meant we had to understand how to contact the people that are going to be living with us so number one millennials younger crowd or on a social media she got out of your social media game\nNumber two you have to understand that when you have to be they're gonna find you and different\nWebsites you got to have a good website they expected to be able to pay on line they expect to be able to they don't want to go to the office of drop off the check they don't want to go to the office in ... minutes for quite some of them are going to do that as we're coming up most of my working all day long\nThey don't have time for that they want to be left alone right so we had developed this virtual online presence so they have to resolve that property we developed at twenty four seven costs dinner or they can call at any time of the day when they were they wanted even after hours\nAnd they can come in and and get information or set up a tour for another day or they need to train a maintenance required to read the various ideas so\nThat particular property made us better made might be the portfolio better made his ... ... in that that better translated into record performances and higher castle for the investors\nNow when we toured you your property the bus tour you just added yeah a whole different armed you team explained it to people the the three different people you picked up the you introduce is doing what they're doing for your company no\nYeah for sure so you you answer like well what drives me in that business what drives me is building the business growing adding the pieces you know competing with the bigger players right and taking market share\nFor them he can award from them taking what they do and then I'll turn your spirit and just you know basically shutting it back to them or I really really like at dealing with this a part of that\nThis request of heard the various ideas do that but they're going to property made us better made might be a portfolio better made is ... ... in that that better translated into record performances and higher casual pretty investors\nNow when we toured you your property and the bus tour you just added yeah older for our team to win that people look at three different people you picked up you introduce as to what they're doing for your company though\nYeah for sure so you're you're actually like what drives me in that business what drives me is building the business growing adding the pieces you know competing with the bigger players right and taking a market share for them it got awards from them take what they do\nAnd then I'll turn our spirit and just you know basically shutting it back to them uh I really really like at dealing with this part of it back in December I realize that we didn't have a true marketing group you know I'm ready to shrug it fails and I can I can I can train my girl and how to do what I needed some help on understanding the\nOnline marketing and so we're able to bring on a few people are two of them or a or a um um they were they were running every ten thousand a year for a photo\nAnd they were the marketing for that and I realized that we didn't really have ... oh yeah it was like in a car with a mammoth get kinda like a\nA shell of what a website was I didn't understand all the Google Analytics and all these other things that were behind the website that they explained to me like oil so they told me that that you could get increased leave\nIf you had it at our website that has certain key words in a while right Robert I'm going to cut you off because we're taking us out too but what a combat I Want you to

Want someone to choose to work with us 'cause it's right for them not because they got the best sales\nLast how inconvenient tending to book a class now how do you narrow more due for a new one what do you WWW dot Arizona the identification dot com which\nThe back of everyone and we are talking with Michael than black and he is the owner of Denali real estate where\nDo we kept a little bit about what we were talking about tenants go ahead\nYeah so I think if you're an attendant out in the marketplace a couple of things\nUh be weary of where you spend your application for you um try to minimize that make sure before you submit your application with all your personal information your Social Security number your date of birth and all that stuff that you make sure that who you're submitting it too is either of real estate company that is\nI'm In charge of their property to rent it or it's actually the property owner or their designated agent right otherwise if you can't\nFind that in and make sure then don't do it\nYou know today it's a different world that we live in it is and even as a ten years ago now I\nIf the gate and that is such\nIn the back every why we are talking with Michael Sam black and he is the owner of ...\nWhere do we kept a little bit about what we were talking about penance go ahead yeah so I think if you're an attendant out in the marketplace a couple of things\nUm be weary of where you spend your application fee use um try to minimize that make sure before you submit your application with all your personal information your Social Security number your date of birth and all that stuff that you make sure that who you're submitting it too is either of real estate company that is\nI'm In charge of that property to rent it or it's actually the property owner or their designated agent right otherwise if you can't\nFind that in and make sure they don't do it\nYou know today to a different world that we live and it is and even as at ten years ago now I said now you've got to be careful about everything that you're doing and that's it you're here to inform them as things that could have absolutely and that's what it's all of that\nThat's right so you know a ... there's also certain things if you're a property owner that's looking to maybe hire a management company like us things that you should look out for as well um I don't think those are necessarily scam type things but I think there are\nThings that you should in your own best interest have in mind to know so when somebody calls us looking for a property manager and say they've never had one before the very first thing that we talk about is this type of stuff like\nHere's what your expectations should be here's what happens in the marketplace ... I I encourage them to call other companies and get information from them so they can have information to make the best decision now\nThat the difficult thing is if you've never done it before you need to have sort of a background hey this is what you should expect a company to do and here's the differences on different things of what you should look for number one is they have a ... every management company has to have a contract required to have an agreement in place um\nIt's a department of real estate requirement so that the devil is in those details so you want to make sure that you read that contract know what's in it a couple of those specific things number one [noise] a lot of these management companies they'll sign you up for like a one year contract so you're in for a year\nWhether you like them or not you're in for a year if you want to get out of it you have to pay some sort of penalties\nSometimes they even tired in some weird way to the tenets lease agreement so let's say you have a tenant that signs the two year lease now all of a sudden you're somehow hiring your manager for two years to if you leave early you still have to pay them what you would have paid them for the whole two years\nSo it's a lot of money [noise] and I'm happy I mean you don't know ... so in our case our agreement can be cancelled at any time there's no early termination penalty I look at it like that\nWe're only as good as our last day for you right so it doesn't matter we did three weeks ago six months ago what did we do for you today what do we do for yesterday if you're not happy with what we're doing I absolutely don't want you to feel stuck\nBut also if you're a new clients signing up with us I think it's important to know hey we're going to put your best interest first but also we're going to be fighting for that every day so all of our client you have hundreds of clients every single one of them can fire me today if\nThey want it to see what I Love about Michael he's just wonderful like that I mean not everybody has the same perspective about what they do and I think that's awesome\nWell I think that comes through with some of the other things as well you know being being able to\nPut the owner um first in a lot of ways so you know like in our case we don't make any money unless the owner is making money so there are other companies and found a way to make money off of these owners regardless of what happens and the costs are much higher um one thing that we\nSix months ago what did we do for you today what do we do for yesterday if you're not happy with what we're doing I absolutely don't want you to feel stuck\nBut also if you're a new clients signing up with us I think it's important to know hey we're going to put your best interest first but also we're going to be fighting for that every day so all of our clients you have hundreds of clients every single one of them can fire me today if they want it to\nSee what I Love about Michael he's just wonderful like that I mean not everybody has the same perspective about what they do and I think that's awesome\nWell I think that comes through with some of the other things as well you know being being able to\nPut the owner um first in a lot of ways so you know like in our case we don't make any money unless the owner is making money so there are other companies and found a way to make money off of these owners regardless of what happens and the costs are much higher um one thing that we do that's a little differently is\nWhen we we used to property for an owner we charge a flat fee it's two hundred and Ninety five dollars it's lower than you can find it's actually below my cost so are charging owner to lease their property less than what it actually costs me to do it there's a reason and that is that if I\nAm looking for the for the right tenet I Need them to stay long term right most companies they're designed where you're paying them one month's worth of rent to find you a tenant\nAnd if they leave in a year they charge you that whole thing again and they're okay with it because they make a lot of money off of that\nSo in our case we don't make money from leasing so I don't like leasing right I Need to find good tenants that are going to stay longer so my screening is designed around finding tenants\nThat stay longer that are going to be in the property longer as opposed to a one year tenant they leave\nWe got to go back and find another enter and I'm going to lose money on that you're alone or does to the on yeah it's an essay the owners going to lose so we have shared interests then right so our interest become aligned where if they're losing we're losing um I don't know if anybody else that does it that way I think it's important because we need to be incentivized to look for\nGood tenants that are going to be there are a long time but also\nWe need to treat them a certain way while they're there right so if if we're doing those things when it comes to the end of the least they're more likely to stay long term our average tendency is over three years\nWell you know we have a lot of people that listen to the station that are investors they a lot of people have you know homes lots of different homes all over as well as we know that we have people out there that are trying to do it in themselves and it's not a good idea it's really not\nGiven the call his numbers for eight out six to six four zero six to checking out its Denali Arizona dot com well\nThe other thing is that the company that you hire they should stand behind their work right so if for example they place a tenant that doesn't work out they should do that or find another tenant for you at no cost um I Know there are some companies out there that\nThat offer those types of guarantees we do as well if you sign up for us within the first three months you're unhappy I'll refund you every time that you paid us if you've paid us for a management fee or whatever I'll I'll refund that um the other thing that we do for listeners to your show if they contact us and want to sign up will find their first tenant for free\nSo actually go through do all the marketing advertising screening\nUm for a tenant and if they approval more signed the least do all these things no cost to them\nAnd you want to know why he says all these things because you know what you do\nYou're right you don't and behind let you do that that the you know the easy part about guaranteeing I don't have any problem standing behind these guarantee because you know that the product in itself in the services that we're offering will make it very easy to offer that\nAgain right to number down it's for eight out six to six four zero six to\nCouple of the things that you know people want to just keep in mind is um you know the having report with\nSo if you've paid us for a management fee or whatever I'll I'll refund that um the other thing that we do for listeners to your show if they contact us and want to sign up will find their first tenant for free so actually go through do all the marketing advertising screening\nUm for a tenant and if they approval most signed the least do all these things no cost to them and you want to know why he\nSays all these things because you know what you do you're right you know am behind let you do that that\nThe you know the easy part about guarantee that I don't have any problem standing behind these guarantees because you know that the product in itself in the services that we're offering will make it very easy to offer them\nAgain right to number down it's for eight out six to six four zero six to\nA couple of the things that you know people want to just keep in mind is um you know the having report with whoever you're dealing with right so I I think a lot of times people get referred for their friends or family in fact the majority of our business comes from those referrals\nUm you need to hire somebody that you feel like you have a good rapport with [noise] you feel is going to be able to um handle things on your behalf\nThe number one reason that people ended up firing their property manager is communication\nMeaning something's going on with their property they don't they don't call them back I had one owner\nThat told me he'd been trying to get a hold of his manager for over a year and had never gotten a call back or even an email wow yeah right one day I call them for a simple maintenance item I said you know hey so and so I just wanted to let you know this is what's going on there is how I recommend me how he said oh yeah sure um\nYou know I'm a kind of shocked right now I said why is that you say you actually called me\nI'm like well that's what I said we were going to do music yeah but my last company would never even call me back for the smallest thing wow it's really crazy it is crazy how people will do business well I think what happens is people get into a position where they hire somebody but then the process of trying to change seems\nVery difficult in our case ... if that's the case somebody has another manager we handle the whole transition for them they don't have to do a thing wow that's awesome so you're really there for them go ahead well I mean I think that's important right so you don't have to be stuck in a certain position that's usually\nThat situation were huge thing where they don't want to go you know that was this gentleman's things like Mike the process of switching over just seems you know emotionally just too much to handle it and like\nAnything else they stick with it just because they know it and they don't know that they can do it or they don't know if they think it's going to be too much\nTrouble he had this this gentleman other things going on in his life and the reality is is that the end he was like man if I would've known that it would have been this easy to change over and I would have been you know getting a more for what I was paying than I was in a long time ago well but I think that's why a lot of people don't\nAgain a lot of people out there you either you're maybe you're trying to rent your property and you're not doing a great job with that have Michael delay\nYes right so a lot of owners will call us when they run into a problem like we've had one that just signed up last week he's like look I got into a problem the tenants owes him rent like five thousand dollars past due and I've been too lenient with um can you come in and get things back Mike wrote to the rescue\nWell yeah so we put a process in place and it's very specific it still tenet friendly but it's a little more forceful right I'm and I'm more specific to what the leaf says and when we try to\nMove along in that way so we have a specific ... plan to get them on with the owner that we've agreed to and if they don't and we we have a plan for that\nToo right you have to have a plan for that to a lot of people especially people that are renting to their ... friends and family which a lot of people do and you shouldn't right we do come back then when you get yourself in a bigger maps and you can pause it was this was actually the issue this this landlord had rented\nTo a problem like we had one that just signed up last week he's like look I got into a problem the tenants ocean rent like five thousand dollars past due and I've been too lenient with them can you come in and get things back Mike wrote to the rescue\nWell yeah so we put a process in place and it's very specific still tenet friendly but it's a little more forceful writing I'm and I'm more specific to what we said than when we try to\nMove along in that way so we have a specific ... plan to get them on with the owner that we've agreed to and if they don't and we we have a plan for that too right you have to have a plan for that to a lot of people especially people that are renting to their ... friends and family which a lot of people do and you shouldn't\nRight we do come back there and then you get yourself in a bigger mess and you can pause it was would this was actually the issue this this landlord had rented to a family friend\nAn urge to have to go to the bathroom like I I've gotta pee [laughter] you know I just got to go or let's say you cough and UP hey yeah\nFor that like the first time that happened and you know you get some place and now you've got to deal with that right so you know now days people think oh well that can't be taken care of wean normalize those kinds of problems\nAnd really you don't have to learn as a device now that uses the electro magnetic energy for correcting all types of incontinence and so if you cough and UP you sneeze UP you can't get on a trampoline you can't do\nAny money and getting on a trampoline and I ... I'm Kelly and most people out there I Know a lot of women are listening to this and it's mostly women I think you'll men do have a kid\nYes and I even though we haven't studied it for men the men who have done it say they get up and go to the bathroom laughed at night some of the work going twice or three times a night now they're not and so there's there seems to be benefits even though it hasn't been studied\nBut before we came on you mentioned to me and and it's so true 'cause I'm One of the woman I Am I've got to be honest with everybody okay so let's just put it out there I'm eleven years on the show now might as well beyond it's okay I copy all the time that I write about what\nPeople out there sneezing whatever but you said women are there they've got their actually stuffing their purses yeah it's a you know with a pet hats and whatever it is you have to buy ... or whatever and is it fun no it's not no we all know it\nSucks I mean I'll be careful\nWe haven't studied it for men the men who have done it say they'd get up and go to the bathroom less at night so if they were going twice or three times a night now they're not and so there's there seems to be benefits even though it hasn't been studied\nBut before we came on you had mentioned to me and and it's so true 'cause I'm One of the woman I Am I got to be honest with everybody okay so let's just put it out there I'm eleven years on the show now might as well to be honest okay I coffee all the time that I write about what how\nMany people out there sneeze and whatever but you said women are there they've got their actually stuffing their purses yeah it's a you know with a pen pads and whatever it is you have to buy panties or whatever and is it fun no it's not mow and we all know it\nSucks I mean I'll be careful but yeah [laughter] women come into our\nOffice and they are so frustrated because they're taking extra pads and extra underwear and all this stuff with them everywhere they go it is expensive the average woman that had from continent spends twelve hundred dollars a year on these patterns\nAnd they think that they need surgery yup but they don't\nThey don't they do not one in three women have and so statistically when I think okay if we she's thirty forty women a day\nOr ten Fifteen have incontinence and we can fix it by sitting on a chair and remain to thirty minutes on a chair you do a series of six treatments and what is doing is eleven thousand key goals in that half hour\nThank you for having somebody do it that fast for me because seriously when you think about how many people I mean first of all most people don't even do it\nYeah right right that's right everybody's supposed to most OBGYNs recommend you do a hundred a day and that's for sure I mean you know how to do it but most women don't know how to do it and it's being done incorrectly\nBut no one wants to sit around and oh yeah oh wait a minute I haven't done my candles today so I Need to do it well I mean we ... that I'm doing a hundred years nothing\nDoing eleven thousand that are greater than any that you can possibly do on your own well sitting in a chair reading a magazine ...\nIf it's okay with

Fort ... everybody call in here for the next ten minutes our number here six so to to seven seven five three six nine\nI Want to ask you what is the biggest mistake\nThat people may well yeah and they're actually kind of to mistakes that are somewhat related one is that they want to go for the very lowest price it's a good idea to try to get the best price but I think sometimes the best price is not always the lowest or the cheapest price because oftentimes those who offer that really cheap price\nThey're cutting corners to do that they're cutting corners on the quality of product maybe it's the secondhand products\nOther cutting corners by not being license bonded and insured or they're cutting corners by not using very experienced installers and then the other part that somewhat related is that they don't choose the right flooring for\nTheir particular environment they don't take into account maybe how much traffic they have in their office they don't take into account maybe to have kids and pets at home or do they entertain a lot and they're going to have a lot of people in their home so those are kind of the two areas that we really tried to consult with people head of time so that they don't\nMake a mistake and we are live on Facebook so again we want everybody out there all of you know maybe it's you know maybe it's someone that you know that wants to get something done to their home making call you guys are and you could talk to them I don't know why I'm losing my voice there I'm Sorry about that I think it's the heat [laughter]\nAnyway uh ... the other thing that I Want to talk about with you is this um when you're working with somebody okay are you talking to us a little bit about the turnaround time okay there's a lot of people right now are\nOut of their offices this is a great time for them to be getting their their ... the new look done now so that they look great for after this summer and all those holidays already that they're going to have exactly\nExactly for example I in a commercial application we're doing a physical therapy center\nAnd we're going to be doing rubber florrie and half the center and then tile and the other and we're doing that all around their customers schedule so it doesn't impact their business are minimal minimal impact so we're doing that on the weekends we consult with the the customers in their home we talked about um well when is a convenient time for you to for us to come in\nBecause it is major construction or home so we uh we move all their furniture for them we haul away the product and we really try to make it the best experience\nPossible what's the turnaround time turn of that because you know you have to talk about you know that's one thing I think people also want when you say that there are going to have their house\nAre out of their offices this is a great time for them to be getting their their ... the new look done now so that they look great for after this summer and all those holidays parties that they're going to have exactly exactly for example I in a commercial application\nWe're doing a physical therapy center and we're going to be doing rubber Florian half the center and then tile and the other and we're doing that all around their customers schedule so it doesn't impact or a business or minimal minimal impact\nThat we're doing that on the weekends we consult with the the customers in their home we talked about um well when is a convenient time for you to for us to come in\nBecause it is major construction in their home so we uh we move all their furniture for them we haul away the product and we really try to make it the best experience hospitals for the turnaround time turn of that because you know you have to talk about you know that's one thing I think people also want when you say that there are going to have their house\nA little bit uh just shoveled rights are a little bit but it's all worth it it's worth it\nBut that you know in terms of the clean up and all of that right right and it does take you know a little bit of time on the homeowners apart but what we tried to do is we really try to make that\nA pleasurable experience as possible it says a lot of fun and yet at the end they will really really love it\nAnd I'm so we consult with them about gee you know at what about if we start in this side of the house for example and then we can move through to your living room dining room first how about that and then your kitchen we'll go to your kitchen and guess what you get to eat out for a day while we're in there because you won't be able to have access to your stove and here the other thing that I Know once you do one thing to one room\nAnd it looks great you got to do the other room because it doesn't look is great right and then they end up it just becomes like a little project that grows and grows and grows yeah we have a lot of repeat business just for that reason we start and do a couple of rooms and it's such a great experience that they say hey\nCome back into her bedroom to come back and do our adapt to lily I bet that happens all the time what's your favorite part of the job [noise] oh I Love going to the job when it's all completed so rewarding\nTo see the customers and how happy they are with the project and until I got into the flooring business I didn't really quite realize what an impact that the floor can have on the way you you live with your family with your friends with your kids and your pets um if it's functional for you it really can have an amazing impact on your life\nDo people try and buy this type of thing on line and what that would be crazy to do I was saying but a lot of people might because everything is done that way right now right yeah you shouldn't do you\nHave you really only thing it's a lot more than that\nYes yes it it is let us the view of the hassle save you the hassle of trying to find the right thing online colors on line I'm really not that famous color than person what are the highest Ehlers right now but ... um well car race in general and design are very very hot\nAnd um if you want kind of the trendy as color the graves and whites and blacks what some people are doing or they're kind of marrying that hot gray color with some of the warm tones the the browns and hopes\nAnd I think that will be a kind of a classic that extend the life of kind of that trendy flooring you put a few warm tones in there\nAnd then that will make your investment laughed all the all the longer what's the number one floor and that you have here in Arizona that you feel that is the most that most people go if I take two things um I Know he's had one but I'm the would look tiles and then the vinyl planks\nThat looked like one of those two are the the most popular they have a wide range of a variety of\nSizes designs colors price points so we really can consult with each customer and find the best of it\nBut I Know a lot of people love that flooring and they love that would look right now it is hot I Know that it really is and there's so many people out there that would love to have something like this and basically they have any price point for you so anywhere from the lower middle at up onto an upper end of quality we\nDo get and we tried to offer all of those options are customers and actually\nOf kind of trendy flooring you put a few warm tones in there\nAnd then that will make your investment laughed all the all the longer what's the number one foreign that you have here in Arizona that you feel that ... is the most that most people go if I take two things um I Know he's had one\nBut I'm the would look tiles and then the uh vinyl planks that looked like one of those two are the the most popular they have a wide range of um variety of\nScientists designs colors price points so we really can consult\nWith each customer and find the best of it but I Know a lot of people love that flooring and they love that would look\nRight now it is hot I Know that it really is and there's so many people out there that would love to have something like this and basically they have any price point for you so anywhere from the lower middle at up onto an upper end of quality do yet and we tried to offer all of those options are customers and\nActually I should also mentioned we have financing options to\nSo if you're moving in and you would say like to get your whole house done now but it just doesn't quite fit in your budget\nWe can help you with that so you can have your whole house done now and then you can pay for it overtime at you know what your comfort their license bonded and ensure basically she's a full general contractor they are commercial residential they come to you and their phone number is direct foray into eight nine three\nFigure out what it is but you need and everybody's situation is different and from what I'm hearing from me right now even if you already have\nYou might need to revisit gas because it sounds like there's some new lives and some new change it\nOr not so much this new laws but every year um these plans can change and they do change some plants stay the same maybe the maximum out of pocket\nUm which is the most are going to pay in any given year for for services to the plan goes up and sometimes they go down I'm most likely they go up because costs go up and so there um but there's also new plants that come out\nUm there's always a new carriers coming in or maybe there's a new plans rolling out that they're trying to position themselves a lot specifically within certain doctor networks\nUm and the most important or the or the biggest reason why people looked at changing because doctors primarily the primary care physicians I'm they get a or terminate out of out of network so they called there there have been turned so whether the doctor didn't agree to the contract\nOr the carrier um they they disagree to not agree and not be contracted anymore and so a lot of ah benefits or is that I work with they love their primary care doctors and so they want to stay with them so they're looked searching for a plan so they can keep your doctor and that's where I help them with\nAnd again he's valley why and everybody that works for them it's a free consultation it's nothing to work with\nHuh 'cause costs go up and so there are but there's also new plans that come out um there's always a new carriers coming in or maybe there's a new plan is rolling out that they're trying to position themselves to do a specifically within certain doctor networks\nUm and the most important uh there are the biggest reason why people looked at changes because doctors the primary to primary care physicians um they uh get or terminate out of the out of network so they called there have been termed so whether the doctor didn't agree to the contract\nOr the carrier um they they disagree to knock agree and not be contracted anymore and so a lot of a beneficial that I work with they love their primary care doctors and so they want to stay with them so they're looked searching for a plan so they can keep your doctor and that's where I help them with\nAnd again he's valley why and everybody that works for them it's a free consultation it's nothing to work with him he is at you actually get paid by the carriers is what happened\nYeah the carrier or pay us to to review or do a comprehensive review with all of our clients and then one such a plan is found for them that works for them that they can maximize the benefits we enrolled them and then we get compensated by here\nBut it's you know what everybody has a different situation and so you have to talk to him and tell them what's going on you're going to get a free car wash from Jackson's carwash if you work with him and at that's free too so it's a free service you know I hate to use these words\nIt's a no brainer but you know what certain things are and in this instance I truly believe that it is important that you pick up the phone had that consultation with him let him talk to you find out what's going on there are too many letters in that alphabet and if you think you can do it yourself you can't you will make a mistake\nI Know for a fact my ex husband get\nAnd what happens when people make mistakes\nOr if you don't and roll into original medical time there can be some lifetime penalties um for every ... months you're not on road you can be fined for prescription drugs\nA penalty of one percent for every month now you're not a role of the national average of it and it's not a lot but if you go thirty six months when it comes it turns out to be allowed to be thirty six percent of the national average at people pay for prescription drugs\nAnd on the um original Medicare part B or if you don't ruin time it's a ten percent pounding these are lifetime Phillies so these are telling me that there aren't these aren't one time okay slap my hand and it's over these are only that\nLast year lifetime so it's important that you work it's important that you were in the right time it's important to do the right way so that you don't get hurt with some penalties and doing it\nWell he's there for you he said seniors advocate his phone number is sick so to seven seven zero nine zero six to the website is a B C D Medicare dot com he's got to um event that's going on when is it\nUh it's October force at ten o'clock at the Denny's on nine year old ... north black Indian highway\nAnd that you're going to be able to see up on the website you can joke go check that out I say it is it I implore anybody and right now it sounds like Medicare is in the air and it sounds like it is a good idea for everybody to make sure that you are in the right plan or if you are just newly maybe get entered at enrolled\nIt's right now the date with starts October Fifteen through the December seventh that's correct but he can help you now call him the number again at six so to seven seven zero nine zero six to it's free to work with him and you get a free car wash out of it to go ahead\nNow so it's important to understand that um I represent all the plans are are in terms of Medicare Advantage from prescription drug plans are are very few plants that I don't represent 'em I'm not tied to any plan I'm an independent broker which means that uh the I'm not working for the\nAble to see up on the website you can joke go check that out I say it is it I implore anybody and right now it sounds like Medicare is in the air and it sounds like it is a good idea for everybody to make sure that you are in the right plan or if you're just newly need to get entered at enrolled\nIt's right now the date with starts October Fifteen through the December seventh that's correct but he can help you now call him the number again at six so to seven seven zero nine zero six to it's free to work with him and you get a free car wash out of it to go ahead\nThat so it's important to understand that um I represent all the plans are are in terms of Medicare Advantage from prescription drug plans are very few
