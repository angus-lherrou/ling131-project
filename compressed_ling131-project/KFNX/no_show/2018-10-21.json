does it\nAnd when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident\nAnd I said ... you have a little tiny house how ... how to build these so high\nI said there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and heart goes from ... and ... he has a business or people had some news or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake ... let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nSecret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management and let me talk about that with the owner built this thing called demanded a lot of people an ape you this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe Thirteen point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just day regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's ATS created these amazing rape plans selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hardest time of the day between three and have him and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies in a monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and they gave the example before people\nNineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three and\nAnd what that is it's ATS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power of the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hardest time of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies in a monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest some of the day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\n... there's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it\nSo the smart energy management the way that the analogy of the people like like that I've been told is remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance\nMonday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay it a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were known more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist no matter when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when it's hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for a home and we and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're killing off our a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty four cents that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got\nAbout this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you any more so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's going to continue to go off\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them and I explain all this to them\nSo not only are you paying between seven and a half and eat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying towards the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um it it just it doesn't make sense for them\nThey can you ... everybody should just call you just find out how to read their bill and then I don't know how to read they're real and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if you go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people who will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site and I do a rate I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again\nAnd I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing us for a year year and a half\nAnd today they're out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to click on a time and then they go home now I understand what she rains and so no\nJudgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon\nI Do a

I Want a hearing on this and then what you'll do is\nNo no no no no no no no no no Bobby Mueller no no no no no no no no no we want\nYou to keep investigating you keep investigating just you get something on him\nThat's exactly what you're going to see happen in the next two years if the Democrat Party is elected that's what they're waiting on\nYou're dealing with ... demons I told you at the very beginning you're not dealing with a regular person like I said tell a lot of these older conservative people they have on or they have pride and they're honest when when they give a word I shake their hand that's not how it is today\nYou are Donald Trump they the Republicans don't even keep third word with him\nSo ... what do you expect\nBut mostly they are all not in tidal okay so that that's the ... that right there is a situation you people have to remember these type of things there's no entitlement to show you that Donald Trump did anything because we don't have to show you\nA damn thing\nEntitled just to say he did it and we don't have to prove it see because that is the way the Democrat Party that is communism that's what they did do have enough\nAlright yeah I mean can you believe this it's a joke we're gonna we're gonna impeach Donald Trump where we're going to impeach capping off we're going to impeach my you know what\nIt's a joke they sound like a bunch of babies they want this country to step backwards haven't you ever heard of ... step and\nI I mean that's what they want to do they want you to back step because\nThe agenda that block Obama gave the American people for eight years was nothing but a bust nothing but a construction of not only our constitution our way of life but it was a complete destruction to the United states of America from top to bottom\nAnd it was by design\nThis is the thing like a lot of people well does bronco bomb I Know you're damn right he knew exactly what he was doing he knows what he was doing just like when he told you okay when he said that America is ...\nIt's a joke they sound like a bunch of babies they want this country to step backwards average ever heard of ... step and\nI I mean that's what they want to do they want you to back step because\nThe agenda that block Obama gave the American people for eight years was nothing but a bust nothing but a destruction of not only our constitution our way of life but it was a complete destruction to the United states of America from top to bottom\nAnd it was by design\nThis is the thing like a lot of people well does bronco bomb I Know you're damn right he knew\nExactly what he was doing he knows what he was doing just like when he told you okay when he said that America's Best days are behind\nOf course they were behind because he wanted them to be behind he dictated an agenda to make America go behind the rock\nAnd sit in the shadow with every other little country okay that is the Lewinsky tactics that he's been playing on you like I told you you grab the list of lens the Lewinsky tactics\nOkay and the situation is you'll see he did it in step except one step to step three step for step by and you would think that Barack Obama wrote that specific page\nI went down that list are back in the day and I couldn't believe there was one or two things that he didn't do and I can't remember 'cause I mean you guys you know how much I gun through but the situation is is\nThat what they want\nAs you see the American people have been rejecting that agenda as you see Donald Trump is destroying that agenda on a daily\nBasis and you're in now a position where you have a bunch of radical wild people out there that don't know what the hell is going on and then you also have a Republican Party that's looking over Donald Trump going we can't let\nThat happen because we can't let people see that it actually that easy to do if we actually get up and go to work every day and work\nWork for the people things actually get done 'cause it sure is funny\nWhen Congress and Senate wanna build done to block Donald Trump from firing Mueller they can put it together within twenty four hours it sure is funny\nRight when the Republican Party wants to block something stupid or\nOn a Law Order of some fraction for immigration they want to ride up something just to give it to the immigration people but when it comes to a wall when it comes to law and order when it comes to actually solving the problems\nThey don't want to solve the problems you want me to tell you why because they are all out of a job\nInstead of solving the problems in

was I saw that video was actually I felt really bad for the man or what the hell are you doing to your kid is reaching out for attention for Christ's sake\nThat's exactly what that is that shows me that he's a lousy father for some kid to go out and put a gun to his head when your father's in government that to me\nIs reaching out that to me is showing me he doesn't show was damn family any attention and if he doesn't show is family any attention just think of the attention that that piece of garbage gave the United states for how many years\nAnd they finally got it and now he's an anti

she does and she knows that let's say mild\nGoing nuts but and then they don't want to know where she's been\nShe'll do guys girls ... who knows what out for crying out loud but\nThe situation is that's part of the demon way\nYou see that that's what should be that's what I'm trying to explain to you and what's really scary here is you're dealing with the demon look they're putting she's not a bad looking woman I had my friend and she really you know she was good luck and I said I didn't say she's a raving beauty you completely I mean you're a\nA model you completely blow away but she's cute\nMean I wouldn't say no after a few beers\nYou know [laughter] yeah now the Republican girls are more Republican guys are going up that's what kind of guy you are\nNo I'm a rocker must step that first or last night and white musically\nAnd open and you can go can email us ... anything in this book\nYeah lead but what's scary is is that she's actually and I can joke about the demon and stuff but that's a perfect sign on housing team in worms she's pretty she smiled and she just said juices\nWith that look when you see here you go you know what I mean she is she she wouldn't do last night and that and how the devil words you ever see that I'm trying to think of that show saved by an angel\nThat's one of those old ... ... ... like ... well that is what it is not as why an angel\nAnd I didn't get more like older guys legacy\nYeah this one well you know the problem with these people but you know we can sit here and laugh about it but you actually got to look Satan straight in the face in that damn um that's how we operate\nYou I mean if you really in that debate and when you did you guys secrets than me girl at the interview after the fact when she got on there she wouldn't answer the question let me see if I can pull this up on my Twitter um but if they had her and the thing she wasn't asked\nLook when you see here you go you know what I see is that you wouldn't do it and that's how the devil work did you ever see that I'm trying to think of that show saved by an angel\nThat's one of those old ... ... ... like ... or ... well that is what it is not just whining Jill and I'm thinking more like older guys legacy yeah this one well you know the problem with these people\nBut you know we can sit here and laugh about it but you actually got to look statements right in the face and that damn uh that's how we operate\nYou I mean if you really in that debate\nAnd when you did you guys secrets than me girl at the interview after the fact when she got on there she wouldn't answer the question let me see if I can pull this up on my Twitter\nUm but they had her and the thing she wouldn't answer the question she kept smiling and ... that's how the demon works the the demon plays tricks on your mind\nSo if you know and you got to be smart you can't let these people play you like a golden fiddle and it's ... that's what I mean by scary she's a good looking woman\nShe knows how to do and I don't mean to sexually Jerry buddy sexual ... she's the senior my so you get the vote you pools\nAnd and you can't let this happen I'm going to look as we go into the break that given eighth and for this clip of her coming out I'll be right back [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah we've got to put it in ... you know my uh blocks that he is or we need to make sure we maintain the majority in the house but here's the thing\nBrian ... at a prayer and Halloween in that race anyway\nSo you might as well All right Dave in and give him a little respect that has urged\nExact and so I I agree with you a hundred percent on that and if I Lived in district mind it's actually what I Would do so all you district ... out there can redeem yourself just like the man said with a mistake you made for voting for for our up by writing into Geils for Congress in district time so there you have\nNo dude and I don't want to be like this and I was all aboard to try to do the right thing but\nAfter what I play down there and when I saw that a that was it when when you disrespect my president and you're supposed to be a Republican and you ... you're too good to go see the president and you want the people vote\nThat are that have backed this president that elected the president you don't deserve the vote that so I get a ... and it has nothing to do and like I told you bro he's the only one I Would do this to\nHey yeah and you can hear the other thing and let's say he could win and we could make the difference whether he didn't he did or didn't uh-huh still not really going to hurt you ever done that much because this was a bit of surprise pick up if he did win exact because they expect the Democrats openness and anyway\nYeah that's why I'm doing what I'm doing anyway\nSo you know I don't think he has a prayer and you know because he lacks a heat acts personality he lacks likeability he lacks believability he lacks ability he lacks a bill to tell the truth about himself on the election\nOr disclosure forms so I I don't like the guy okay so uh you know I'm well\nThank you I mean 'cause we got the Republicans at the woman's group well wait where they they had to\nGo fight about this on you get a big old flight out about this on tax though [laughter]\nI Know I Know and I just wouldn't let up on this specific guys now if it was like big Sally I

doors so much for printing the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I worked as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after that I knew the president\nI get so many threats some of the death threats I'm certain ... gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him and your um ... or ... the Democrat signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living trying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to ban the private schools\nThey're just out in the country and they're working and they like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much under the president's leadership and then on the other side they see\nChaos identity politics\nConstant cries of racism or an embrace of illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been a case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear and I think it I think this blows up and the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here\nProud of him and you're on the uh the ... the Democrats signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nThink that again people who work hard for a living trying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools\nThey're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much under the president's leadership and then on the other side they see\nChaos identity politics\nConfident cries of racism\nOr an embrace of illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been a case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up and the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue in actually pass legislation to stop this this was an emergency what's happening to this country\n[laughter] it's a learning the now with ... and coming toward the border and I think the president is standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met in Washington back during the Reagan years and you know I worked for Jack Kemp and\nIt was people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country\nAnd and have backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump and have backbone and would never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh\nYou saw what happened when the president just said simply nope I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have that are approved\nAnd confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh rethought spines grow in senators we didn't even think Adam any re Lindsey Graham was a hero of German Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates from the strength in the White House\nThe immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down the stairway in Trump Tower\nAnd then his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they tried to conflate like you mentioned are illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that\nOver and over and over again and they're still doing it today\nBut it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch buckets of work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumps the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health a radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done in the last few years on immigration are shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same and that's a million people a year it's a lot\nOr or to be decrease so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain a saying that the Gallup poll from June I'm\nThirty seven percent want the level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration twenty\nNine percent want it decreased okay\nTwenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration and that those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to do it because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration is doesn't affecting your life\nYour kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nUh and I've given a school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrant for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent less so you know people don't want\nThirty seven percent want it to remain as saying that the Gallup poll from June\nThirty seven percent want that level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration twenty nine percent want it decreased okay\nTwenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration and that those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to do it because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration is doesn't affecting your life\nYour kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nUh and I've given a school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrant for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent less\nSo uh you know people don't want that\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's very blue collar area\nAh in recent year a year or so we've seen you know truckloads of illegal or legal immigrants arrested at a seven eleven on their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants\nIn and uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them in cash on e just got a found guilty the other day\nOf this kind of crackdown needs to continue because I'll tell ya in\nIn Buffalo where we used to be a strong steelworkers town were not anymore we're we're starting to come back under the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here need these jobs need these jobs and and do they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about\nAnd the Democrats and the mainstream media spend their time trying to gas light them on this issue talking about how important\nAre immigration is to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're complaining as illegal immigration for president isn't against immigration is against illegal immigration\nAnd I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process but first the immigration process\nAnd then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if it got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it\nKnow and the problem she sees is it the surrounded by people were all surrounded by people who are here illegally some of them are now over ... etc\nIf it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly you ... it's you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and in one way shape or form a and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they ... it can't happen because because without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right a border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but\nLook the chaos at the at the border\nIs is not dissimilar a Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets in the ... in the aftermath of Kavanaugh\nA and the Democrats prefer that because if this chaos you need more government\nGovernment grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long conflict\nThey've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right a border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but\nLook the chaos at the at the border\nIs is not dissimilar a Michael to

bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh\nThe screaming in the hearings the the uh the people running down the uh the always the basement of the United states Capitol screaming at senators the the people trapping senators\nAn elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras the mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed the people trying to literally raft with their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building\nThey like that they're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans would lose the house\nBecause a lot of people who were not measure well by the polls in twenty sixteen they call us deplorable right that people who hadn't voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all\nThey found a champion and Donald Trump someone they fought a non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in a midterm election\nThose kinds of folks tend to think well I got my guy and I'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kids off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know a a skip the or the

over there and the next thing I knew he yelled out a political statement was something to that effect do you believe\nIn people don't give a belief about the middle class and he\nJust sucker punch me I didn't see it coming and I was sitting in a higher power chair and I went flying back and once my head hit the ground that was all I remember oh my gosh that and I could tell you it was a very big guy\nDid\nOr did he get out for her to do that and um they did catch up with them two days later I'm found them he basically told them that are ... the deputy asked them whether or not I said\nOr did anything to provoke him and his answer was no he the jeopardy asked them\nDid you give them any warning prior that you were going to hit him his answer was no and then the deputy asked him do you know where you had him and he said yeah right right and yeah\nSo in the arrested for assault\nThey had been arrested and charged him yet they're waiting for the uh to determine the level of the charge or waiting for the medical report as well as the video surveillance\nAnd you're obviously going to testify against them you've already given statement\nYeah they came out they took pictures of the the bruises on my body and um my eyes which was you know the way to my I was like had to I don't know was all red mhm and uh now now it's the concussion side I've learned that the sun is not my friend\nOh

sense that we weren't uh like minded going into it I guess are up until that point but\nIt's just you know wail somebody in the head and send them flying is is like I said before it's not something I was signing up for\nWell Shane a first of all the left is trying to intimidate good Americans like you from running for office they're trying to frighten people scare them and if\nDoesn't work physically attacked them out of a race physically prevent you from running\nAnd this is being encouraged by the Democrats at the highest levels\nEven those who claim over not for violence of course we're not for violence then where are they why are they supporting this caravan approaching the U.S border that is lawlessness complete and utter lawlessness they embrace lawlessness if the ends are in their minds justified noble\nSo that means are justified excuse me at the end is noble in the end is electing Democrats or you can bring more of a a ... social spending framework voice that on the

background\nI I really don't um I I I I've heard a few things that I'm a I guess there's some he's in the trades of some sort of what I've learned but beyond that I don't really know much about him mhm are you familiar with the curly big guy to be hard to have you\nHave Democrats are in the state spoken out against us you know I\nI actually know so like both of our senators are Democrats and neither one of them to my knowledge as of yesterday anyway had come out and publicly denounced it um [noise] I Will say that my Congressman Tom emmer he did call me a soon as you heard about it\nWas the first time they've ever called me about it and you know give me as a condolence has the support and all that I was you know but but\nOther than you know none of none of our representation or higher up people have come out and said that to the to the last I looked at me like imagine if you are and it would be the motor that this thing this is the norm now it just you know go out and\nLike you said getting their face kick them when they're down with a bit of comments or I got tore up for using that exact lining up Facebook respond well calling out the comments from Hillary and Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and\nAnd if somebody actually spend a local publication as my understanding that how would how would their their comments have any influence in rural Minnesota I don't know if they don't think we don't have a radio and TV out here was [laughter]\nYeah so Eric Holder if they go low we kick 'em Hillary Clinton and if they go low we hit harder or whatever it is she\nSaid ah right yeah well and of course it doesn't affect I mean I don't know about this guy I don't know what his deal is but of course it has an effect\nIt's meant to intimidate it is a type of political intimidation and its physical intimidation and up to the point of committing crimes\nBut again they they they attempt to dehumanize entire groups of people like if you're a conservative and Minnesota and you run for office and you and you call it as it is they have to call you a racist you they have to say that you're anti women\nAre and you might imagine what they would have done Shane if a a

N. G. W. N. Virginia Line to what does this mean seven eleven\nAnd you hope I'm right this time I got out of their program I told you Donald Trump you come next broke and I said\nSo let's start with that but let's go to your eleven thing\nNumber one there's two ways to look at number eleven number one the way they we use the number two the way it pops up now let's go to the first\nNine eleven happened the love at first plane hit the world Trade Center was eleven nine eleven happened two hundred fifty fourth day of the year two five forty was eleven\nThe twin towers look like an ... number eleven ... standing side by side they both have a hundred and ten stories Oklahoma City happened for Nineteen Nineteen Ninety five for one nine one nine nine five after thirty eight three Nate adds up to eleven\nFirst bomb went off at nine o to do the math I got eleven and then executed Timothy McVeigh for on the eleven\nSo basically what is going on here because obviously that's not going to\nBe I can understand that numbers have vibration of energy that people were in power are very aware of very aware of this now if you think online ask yourself why World War one ended at eleven eleven at exactly eleven o'clock it in South firing a shot that that'd be fine they waited till eleven\nHold on show what seven cycles of eleven plus two of my list\nThere was quite alive and nine eleven happened two hundred fifty fourth day of the year two five four equals eleven the twin towers looked like an ... number eleven ... standing side by side they both have a hundred and ten stories Oklahoma City happened for Nineteen Nineteen Ninety five for one nine one nine Ninety five after thirty eight three Nate adds up to eleven\nFirst bomb went off at nine o to do the math I got eleven and then executed Timothy McVeigh for dinner on the eleven\nSo basically what is going on here because obviously that's not a coincidence\n[laughter] yeah I can understand that the numbers have five ... energy that people were in power are very aware of very aware of this now if you think online ask yourself why World War one and then at eleven eleven at exactly eleven o'clock they didn't stop by and shot that that'd be fine they waited till eleven\nOr hold on one to seven cycles of eleven plus two of my last book shedding number eleven on the New York times list your mind mean for me\nWell it's not what it means to my mind is what it is and basically what it is is that you were having an emotional impact on people with a lot\nThat's what it basically breaks down to you have to understand that when average you see the number eleven whether it be or whether Charlottesville when they made sure that event happening on eleven or they have this ... figures\nOr it doesn't matter where you go with this the number eleven is going to touch people emotionally I'll give you an example how this works um about a line\nLet me interject for a minute my friend ... who was a promise said this he said Dr Savage the number eleven is considered a master number is the most powerful neurological vibration\nRemember you said vibration he says simply state of the double one is the number of awakening when it shows up at the notes that the catalytic the message is being relayed which will serve to inspire eliminate motivate\nAdditionally seven is the number of wisdom knowledge in in a reflection therefore seven cycles of eleven only magnifies that concept of awareness which sets in motion a change of or a breakthrough for you my best learning what do you think about that\nWell I I Would agree with a lot of that and the way you can show again the way you verify this as you look at the way they we do not want average everyday people do what they do there is a store called seven eleven all around the world to Savage so obviously those two numbers go very well together\nI mean nobody that's generic that's a generic statement when does it mean with regard to my my numbers eleven coming up all the time\nNot generic at all because the only way to verify this stuff actually work it's a look at the people at the top of the game and see how they're actually doing things\nSo yes they're doing things under eleven energy but the what your friend told you was only the positive side there's negative side says number eleven to that's why al ... was form on August eleventh that's why hit New York on nine eleven that's why they hit Madrid, Spain I'm for eleven that's why I had moved from India after eleven so there's two sides of the coin Dr Savage\nHanging energy so what are you saying\nWhat I'm saying is this you are touching people's alive with your words you have a gift for writing and that's\nWhy your books are reaching number eleven it's not like New York times manipulating this up the number that's coming out because you're having the most emotional ...\nWait a minute the book before Trump's before God faith in the reason was number one on the New York times list that's another one on one than eleven nine eleven so waiting for instance average first of all I predict stunning results for the podcast venture he says you'll get more or less\nThis rather age groups the demographics is going to be used and he goes on from there will be our you don't want to make any predictions do you\nI Will I Will make you a prediction that when it comes down to the coins will be proven to be a fraud\nYou very much for saying something I Do nothing about nor I Know I even put that in there but that diminished everything you're saying\nAnd people alive with your words you have a gift for writing and that's exactly why your folks are reaching number eleven it's not like New York times and manipulate and lift up a number of coming out because you're having the most emotional input\nWait a minute the book before Trump's before God faith in the reason was number one on the New York times list that's another one uh one than eleven nine eleven so a very Savage first of all I predict stunning results for the podcast venture he says you'll get more or less\nThis rather age groups of demographics it's going to be used and he goes on from their wealth of the hour you don't want to make any predictions do you\nI Will I Will make you all for addiction that when it comes down to the point will be proved to be a fraud\nThank you very much for saying something I Know nothing about nor I Do I even put that in there but that diminished everything you said before\nJoining the Savage Nation coal no he five four hundred and Seventy five or seven to eight to salvage [noise]\nA heck of Michael my idea is less than ... F ... scores are not everything and we want some type of affirmative action but that might be more fair than what's fair now what if we increase the way you put your rank your high school class that is what they have a little bit of advantage\nTo know why why would that matter let's say you go to a high school where there's all slow learners or or for such and you're like number one what would that mean when you go up against kids who are number one in schools where there's tremendous competition huh that's got a standard for everyone to follow\nBecause of things because they don't have somebody who came from a disadvantaged background gives them an opportunity\nTo forget what the disadvantaged I came from a disadvantaged background and no one reached out and gave me anything\nI just had to work harder to get where I Am stop with the disadvantaged community there are plenty of kids that come out of ghettos and rise to the top because to have drive in that brain stop at garbage about disadvantaged that's that's another watch the liberal left disadvantaged what is it actually mean\nWhat does that mean disadvantage tell me what does it mean\nTo me that they don't have as many resources that parents are not as as you can\nAlso in other words a kid who comes from a family where the parents killed themselves to be educated and to keep the kid in school they should be punished now\nNo I'm saying this is\nWhat you are you're saying yes you're saying automatically because if a kid comes from a household where let's say there's no father which by the way it's not even a racial thing anymore let's say there's no father at home it's a single parent and let's say a day he's poor\nAnd he lives in a terrible neighborhood how do you explain all of the poor whites who came out of tremendous poverty\nAnd yet excelled in school how do you explain that\nStop it that garbage about disadvantaged that's that's another watch one of the liberal left disadvantaged what is it actually mean\nWhat does that mean disadvantage tell me what does it mean\nIt it it it means that they don't have as many resources that parents are not as best you can\nAlso in other words a kid who comes from a family where the parents killed themselves to be educated and to keep the kid in school they should be punished now\nNo I'm saying this is\nWhat you are you saying yes you're saying automatically because if a kid comes from a household where let's say there's no father which by the way it's not even a racial thing anymore let's say there's no father at home it's a single parent and let's say a there he's poor\nAnd he lives in a terrible neighborhood how do you explain all of the poor whites who came out of tremendous poverty\nAnd yet excelled in school how do you explain that\nYeah I I I I got on the benefits are fantastic stories I realize that\nThe you know that there was a time at Harvard that Jews were not permitted into Harvard or you know that\nFor something that\nYou know let let me just explain it I've studied this in great detail that was a time the Jews were prohibited from entering harm or did you know that\nI flew into that yet\nAnd yet some kids won't let him because they were so brilliant their scores were so high there was a genius was they finally let 'em in okay now we turn that around where the stupidity or the higher your chances of getting in that\nYou know my friends stop with the words like homelessness to me to me homelessness has no meaning that's a left wing phrase to make you feel guilty and the other word is disadvantaged\nWhat do you think every person in this country was white has an advantage you believe in white privilege\nNovak clock that why this would help poor white kids from Appalachia and for the you know in other words if you're gonna you're increasing in a way that your kids for their relative to agree in school with they grow up and\nYou're making a good point but how fair is that\nI think it's fair\nNo that's like saying being a big fish in a little pond as opposed to being a small fish in a big pond exactly right so you're saying take the big fish from the small pond\nAnd then when that kid who thinks he's great from Appalachia because he got straight days in a high school of a underperforming or poor performing kids winds up and leave college so called they're on those such things anymore unless they're in the hard science as the rest as all trash\nUnless you're a hard science is no such thing as an institution that's better than the other all of the others mishmash of direct\nIn plain English but let's say you take that kid who was number one in the Appalachian high school and you put them into a so called Ivy League school and then he he faces kids who've been studying since one year old\nHell hell hole improving yourself at a young age rather than trying to get social justice for his forty years old and ... and he doesn't\nYou're assuming you will if you're making an assumption that because you let him into that elite school is going to become a fair minded person\nI've seen the opposite I think that people were given an unfair advantage just become worse because then they expected their whole life and then he gets out of a Princeton and Harvard or Yale or whatever and then when he goes for a job then he goes into the corporate world and then what is your demand you hire me routes what I'll show you\nKnow no one can\nCan you ask anybody in the corporate world what they have to put up with with kids would come out of the schools who use the very same tactics they used to get into the schools in the corporation they will sue you at the drop of a hat everybody knows this\nThe thing is people listening to me saying how dare even say it I Know it goes on in this country what should I hide what's real\n\nWe disagree on this one\nI say no don't give anyone of special advantage either it's equal to every one or it's not equal at all is that simple you know there's no such thing\nI've seen the opposite I think the people who were given an unfair advantage to become worse because then they expected their whole life and then he gets out of a Princeton and Harvard or Yale or whatever and then when he goes for a job then he goes into the corporate world and then what does he demand you hire me or else what else do you\nKnow no and I look at\nAnd you ask anybody in the corporate world what they have to put up with with kids would come out of the schools who use the very same tactics they used to get into the schools in the corporation they will sue you at the drop of a hat everybody knows this\nThe thing is people listening doing saying how dare even say it I Know what goes on in this country what should I hide what's real\n\nWell we disagree on this one\nI say no don't get any won a special advantage either it's equal to everyone or it's not equal at all is that simple you know there's no such thing\nAs a reverse racism\nThose words don't have any meaning either it's racism or isn't racism so if your school to Asians are whites because they're doing too well that's racism\nAnd you know I thank God the Asians finally issued this has been going on since Nineteen Seventy eight\nThat so [noise] but no one who's Asian listen to the show they're too busy working\nA four and five forty seven to eight to now before I take a break\nI Can't wait for the park has come January\nCan I tell you it's been about it we had a big part cast meeting this morning of a team of sixteen people it so it's going to be amazing here's how it's going to work the show is going to be live this first hour on the stations that carry me\nNow some stations will not carry me not because the ratings are annoying Norman's ratings but because we're going to be going into the cycle of the election and liberals are running some of these stations they're taking me off the air that's the way it is I don't care what they tell you that's what's happening\nOkay but the rest of your we'll get we'll hear the radio show for an hour and then anybody can hear the podcast for free there's no charge for it anywhere in the world at any time\nAnd I expected it will be one of the largest broadcaster in the world and so all predictors indicate that\nIt will become one of the most important part cash on the planet\nAnd if you don't believe me wait until January you wait and see what's going to happen\nSo one way or the other the gatekeepers are going to go whether it's at Harvard or in the radio business\nIt's that simple they can try all they want they can destroy any stationed in the world and get away with it but you know what if you have the truth the truth is going to set your free\nKB T clean line seven go

president in my lifetime no except for Ronald Reagan who are really ... got dozens of the relief\nFrom about from Iran right after ... after coming into office and Reagan we we've struggled with this country we don't deal with there if we don't negotiate with there as well in fact Donald Trump didn't ... even more to happen\nBy crashing or by crushing their current went and and basically saying released them demanding it and\nI was actually picking up to do for from a Chinese restaurant in Buffalo\nI looked at the ab spring across the room and I saw the pastor on alive start with the president of the United states talking I talked to myself\nIt'd be nice if this man gives president or give President Trump credit for getting out of there getting him out of there and then I saw him fall to his knee yes prayer and live television in the oval office ran over television almost knocking over\nUnable full of diners here and I couldn't believe the prayer I knew that there were liberal heads exploding all around the\n... you know that but this is what we love about God or his truth is always out there and there are in specific appointed times when it comes out and that was the case in point because as I'm Tony Perkins who was saying the company a pastor Brunson his wife\nAre here to the United states you know they said that to Tony says looking you know we pray every day for the president you think it would be okay uh you know why do you think you'd be okay if I put my hand on his head and pray for him when he goes I\nDon't think you want to put your hand on his hand but you can certainly pay for it [laughter] so\nHe doesn't like people talk to their I guess but yeah you know what the president ... ... it's so interesting because people don't think of Donald Trump as a religious man and indeed we know much more religious people on our live ... what the president is surrounded by good lovers of God and religious men and women who believe in him not\nHis truth is always out there and there are specific appointed times when it comes out and that was the case in point because as I'm Tony Perkins was saying who accompanied a pastor Brunson his wife\nAre here to the United states you know they said to to Tony says look and you know we pray every day for the president you think it'd be okay uh you know the wife is do you think you'd be okay if I put my hand on his head and pray for him when he goes I\nDon't think you want to put your hand on his head but you can certainly for it [laughter]\nSo he doesn't like people talk to their I guess but yeah you know what the president ... ... it's so interesting because\nPeople don't think of Donald Trump as a religious man and indeed we know much more religious people in our lives ... what the president is surrounded by good\nLovers of God and religious men and women who believe in him because he was right but because he is doing the right thing for our country and he's surrounded by those people you know I was raised Christian band and I you know I saw people judging others in my time in life\nBut they eat Donald Trump is don't want to believe in someone who do the right thing for our country and I'm just amazed at how much it that's bad\nAnd the prayers of all Americans are without reservations and in the White House\nWill remember for the rest of my life\nWell which emblazoned in my mind as well Michael was when a then candidate Trump\nOn a plane member that picture they showed a even Jell ago surrounding and praying for him on a on the Trump plane\nOr you know that that told me a lot there\nThat he was he was looking to God and I I I kinda thought in some ways you know kind of like George Washington and a little bit like Solomon and if you remember the story of Solomon when he was um you know confronted with the reality that God has chosen Angela lead the children of Israel\nAnd George Washington realizing that uh you know God's hand was upon this great American experiment and of all people he was going to be the president they wanted him to be king you know they don't you know we know we're not going to go there all be your president\nBut he realized it was by divine Providence at this great American experiment to me this ragtag crew of\nYou know uh I'm trained military people for all intents and purposes or taking on the number one military importance on the planet\nAnd we when we went to go on to realize this great American experiments is great idea that the founding fathers put together and who did they look\nAbove all else said look to God for wisdom in order to come up with the you know when you read the constitution you you know as you say Michael there's so many right things\nIn the constitution is in you can say I mean in in in our Christian germs we say it's righteous but it is right does write things that are immutable then you just say wow how how do you argue against freedom of speech how do you argue against a life liberty and the pursuit of happiness how do you argue against\nThe certain immutable rights that are given to us not by the government by God himself how do you argue that\nI'll tell ya on a great point I Love this conversation I I've known my eighty eight my I was really close with him are working on it out there for twenty eight I interacted with them many different time since Nineteen eighty eight and I know that he was considering running for president all that time\nAnd he was on ... ... it was it was really wrestling what am I could do many different conversations that but you could do it you kind of wanted to do it but it was a cop or with the idea of it and I think in many different ways you know he was honored by uh\nAgainst freedom of speech how do you argue against are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness how do you argue against these certain immutable rights that are given to us not by the government by God himself how do you argue that\nI'll tell you you're on a great a point by love this conversation I I've known the person if\nEighty eight my I was really close with him are working on it out there for\nTwenty eight fire interacted with them many different time\nAh since Nineteen eighty eight and I know that he was considering running for president all that time\nAnd he was on ... ... it was it was really wrestling where am I couldn't do any of our conversation with you that but you could do it you kind of wanted to do it but he wasn't comfortable with the idea of it and I think in many different ways you know he was honored\nBy a big you know a private that comic for the United states but didn't know him a long time to come around to the need to do it\nAnd to understand but it has to be the most ... west ...\nBut he had ever done in his white ... retires something Donald Trump would like us salsa\nYeah to a a it lived in Trump Tower in an apartment but it's so much nicer than the White House\nWith a wife who is it was after all died due to fall and eating given all that up to serve our nation I Know he wasn't comfortable with it across twenty twenty five years but when he finally came down the stairs to run for president he was ready and he's writing to bake the Sunni way\nOr the service station and I just thank God for him every day\nExactly you know you talk about the selfless act I mean so much so that uh he donates his uh his earnings as president of the United states\nUh ... you know it is a quite remarkable less people forget about that last name forgets what he has done in terms of job creation what he's done in terms as to what he said on his on inauguration speech which was quite interesting you know listen to the people who thought it was a dark speech\nBut main street America since he gets it\nWhen he said that today were returning the government in the rightful hands of the people that it belongs to weave and people\nWill come back and uh you know this is what he's done is he's continued to move more and more away from the ideals of the previous administration that said that they wanted to fundamentally transform this country\nFundamentally transform it from what to what\nYou know and look what happened we almost became Venezuela under the previous administration\nThat's true and and people will call better dark speech\nAre the ones that pay who can't believe in and are\nAre are are fighting so hard to remember a\nA fulfilling the promises but he made in that speech I don't mind that this is what we all have to understand as the mid term elections of these attacks on Donald Trump the attacks on Brett Kavanaugh the focus of Russia bogus Russia investigation it's all about one thing in each\nExactly good point Michael we'll leave it right there Michael poodle and Bill Maher team as Michael

an option to produce your own power and when you understand\nThat you're not writing a check it's approved credit there's no money out of pocket to do this\nSo you're going to pay you less per month then you're paying to the electric company so where's the difference going it's going in your family's budget and hustled bank account\nAnd it's as simple as that and if we think that the rates rate the rate increases are going to stop here\nWere sorely sorely mistaken um there's ... mid term elections coming up in two thousand Eighteen solar is a big thing right now I'm a P has has been told that they have to produce a lot of renewable energy as just a therapy [noise]\nWhen they do they are not going to pass those savings are you there never lowering our power or our our electric rates they're just not it's not going to happen [noise]\nUm they will take these these different things that are passed into law to their favor so I educate my family's take what's available to them now the federal tax credits the state tax credits and\nThe the panels are going to produce your pirates seven seven to eight cents per kilowatt\nThere's no better benefits than saving money on your power

of a\nSay things that that are not so well they're just using part of my name's to make sure you go to ask solar Sandy dot com and then if you want to follow me on my new Facebook it's the real southern Sandy Arizona\nSo that you know it's me the real southern Arizona is still don't end up with the sun [laughter] the real soldiers and Arizona because\nI Want people to get the most accurate and informative information an eye on a on a daily basis I'm reading in researching about what's going on with our power companies Arizona corporation commission\nUm technology all kinds of things is is not you know when I was a nurse Carol\nUm we went to school and we went to classes and we had to go to a lot of classes and we had to pay ... a ... a lot of tests\nThere is no test for this and so there's a lot of people out there giving miss information and ... it almost happened to my daughter and that's why I got into this doing this because I said if it could happen to my daughter\nHow many other people is it happening to let me talk for you first\nLet me how this I've been thinking as I've been listening to you how fortunate we are to have you here Oh thank you and the reason why is because ah it's it's educational at you know I mean I I Am so fortunate to have met you and it was a whim but you've been on here and you\nHave now educated so many people she's helped a lot of people out there she's not stop and she is on fire I'm humbled I'm humbled by that care 'cause I really feel that the solar is my mission and my ministry and I am obligated to pay the sport\nAnd when I talk about my family's you could have one person in your house you could have seven I just saw a family that had nine um [noise] I treat them as if they're my own family I Want them to know that they're going to get the best\nInformation imparted to them from me just like my daughter because\nMy daughter's my daughter for the rest of my life\nAnd that's your home that your family and I'm wanting to

obligation free consultation go up on that website I Know you've heard her\nBut a lot of people still haven't made that decision it's a free consultation it doesn't matter caller she loves to talk to people tell you exactly what it is that you can do for you that number it's six to three\nEight five zero eight two two\nThe best information imparted to them from me just like my daughter because my daughter's my daughter for the rest of my life and that's your home that your family and I'm wanting to share the same that along to them here we go\nI'm losing my voice is the truth because she talked so much but it's very good because that's the thing is about you is it yours so\nYou want to make sure that people are empowered to be able to know\nThe difference about what what they could

her out yeah but you know what you're going to see her everywhere she is on fire she wants to help you what would be some of the final words that you want to say it's hot out there guys why should we pay the money to them when we can keep it for ourselves I absolutely\nCarol I mean it's hard enough to budget for things that we you know or cars or homes or you know clothing whatever and then we get this this power bill that we didn't expect an end for people who are um budget building\nUm this year you you've probably seen an increase in your budget building but that's not the end of it at the end of the year if you've used more power or those adjustments that demand church is more than what you paid in your budget building you'll have what's called the settled amount at the end of the year\nThat could be five hundred a thousand or more and I've seen that happen already this year people have called me and said Sandy I Know exactly what you might have already seen it on my bill [noise] if you don't have that they shut your power off\nSo again here's the power companies dictating to us what we have to pay and how we live or don't live comfortably in our own homes on based on\nHow how much we can afford now you can produce your own use it anytime you want three day pm one eight one eight PM it really doesn't matter 'cause you're producing your own at seven to eight cents per kilowatt\nLess thought go to a pistons Web site go to assert these weapons I don't take my word for it there is no rate when it's going to give you power for between seven and eight cents per kilowatt and guarantee in guarantee it for the next twenty five years I Can't\nThis is the only way that you can lock in your power costs and no for the next twenty five years\nThis is on the number to call her six to three eight five zero eight two two nine I don't care if you've heard of before\nI Do not care if you're on the fence collar find out what she can do\nFor you that's what she's here for her number again it's six to three eight five zero eight two tonight she's got proof now of everything that she could shows me right now she just put it in my face you ever called sixty

now she just put it in my face gave her call sixty three eight zero eight two nine it's solar Sandy dot com high so it's handy here\nBut it's a matter of two of our setting up a wall between them\nAnd us through our own feeling of guilt we don't want to give we don't want to admit that we were wrong it only makes things worse to know that we were wrong and that's the situation in which every man finds himself with God the meaning of Christ cross\nIs that God took the initiative to break that wall down\nTo get us out of their spiritual dog house and this was known me or tactical maneuver on his part he loved us he did he dies he determined that nothing should be allowed to stand in a way of that love is even if it meant taking all our ideal upon himself God's soul of the world that he sent his own they'd be gotten son\nAll we like she had gone astray\nWe had turned everyone to his own way but the lord laid on him the iniquity of us all\nHe was wounded for our transgressions\nHe was bruised for our inequities upon him was laid the ... that made us hole and with his stripes we are here we preach Christ crucified St Paul said that there is if there is a connection between the cross\nAnd now we're seeing and there is in St Paul said to the collections God has forgiven you all your sins crisis utterly wiped out that damning evidence of broken laws and commandments which always hung over our heads and it's completely a noted\nBy naming it over his own head to the garage and then having drawn the sting of all the powers ranged against us you expose them shattered empty undefeated in his final glorious triumphant act and that of course was the resurrection\nYou have a sense of personal inadequacy is there the annoying feeling at your soul that you want everything that you should be are you constantly irritated by your business associates\nYour friends members of your family or you bothered by temptations of one kind or another that keep coming back no matter how hard you try to dispel them\nI can promise you that acceptance of Christ crucified will solve all of your personality problems all we'll solve any of them immediately but this I say with complete confidence making the cross of Christ you alone would change your whole outlook on life it will bring you into a relationship a friendship\nWith God the kind that God wants to have with you\nIt will give got his chance to make you more and more the kind of person that he intended to be and that's pretty wonderful considering what God has got to work within the case of most\nInadequacy is there the knowing feeling at your soul that you want everything that you should be are you constantly irritated by your business associates your friends members have your family or your bothered by temptations of one kind or another that keep coming back no matter how hard you try to dispel them\nI Can't promise you that acceptance of Christ crucified will solve all of your personality problems all will solve any of them immediately but as I say with complete confidence making that cross of Christ your own would change your whole outlook on life it will bring you into a relationship a friendship\nWith God the kind that God wants to have with you\nIt will give got his chance to make you more and more the kind of person that he intended to be and that's pretty wonderful considering what God has got to work with and the case of most of us it's a pretty wonderful all around a godsend his son and then he died to bring us back to God\nBecause the glory and the wonder of it which causes St Paul to say to all of us Christ did not send me to see how many I could baptize\nProclaimed the gospel and I have not done this by the persuasive ... of clever words or I have no desire to Rob the cross of its power the preaching of across is I Know nonsense to those who are involved in this dying world\nOr to wash who are being safe from that debt it is nothing less than the power of God it is written\nI Will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the ... will I reject or consider what have the philosopher the writer and a critic of this world to show for all of their wisdom has not gone made the wisdom of this world look foolish\nOr was after the world and its wisdom had failed to no God that he and his wisdom chose to save all who would believe by the simple mindedness of the gospel message\nOr the Jews ask for me regular spruce and the Greeks and intellectual panacea but all we preach is Christ crucified stumbling block to the Jews and shared nonsense to the ... but for those who are cold weather Jews are gentile\nRice the power of God and the wisdom of God amen [noise]\nYou're listening to the ... through an hour and we just heard a message from Dr Oswald Hoffman first reached in Nineteen fifty five talking about the rapid pace of technology I'm joined here in the studio by Dr Cooney cook director of us ministries looper and our ministry the rapid pace of technology is nuts load at all as\nI remember when I was a kid I Lived out on a farm I'm In a little cornfield we didn't have air conditioning we didn't have cable TV we didn't have a cell phone we didn't have an answering machine at one point we didn't have computers you know anything like that\nAnd think of where we are today it was like I was living you know like life on the prairie [laughter] and then then all of sudden those technological advances started and they started to you know can multiply speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking\nWell I'll just let the next generation deal with that I can remember when the Internet came out\nI had this thought that will I'm sure that just kind of her kids I really don't need them in and out in the day you know how to get a permeated everything so yeah a technology I think is an amazing amazing gift but it it does make your head spin and then also\nBrings questions of of morality and in usage and how were you didn't things appropriately or or inappropriate as well\nDr Hoffman speaking back in Nineteen fifty five said things are happening so fast it's impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better and\nLike life on the prairie [laughter] I don't like that and then then all of sudden those technological advances start and they started to kinda multiplies ... speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking well I'll just let the next generation deal with that I can remember when the Internet came out\nI had this thought that well I'm sure that just kind of her kids I really don't need and [laughter] and now today you know how it's it's gotta permeated everything so yeah I'd technology I think is an amazing amazing gift but it it does make your head spin and it also\nBrings questions of of morality and an usage and and how we're using things appropriately or or inappropriate as well\nDr Hoffman speaking back in Nineteen fifty five said things are happening so fast it's impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better and that's the same thing we could say today what does that mean for Christianity for the church\nBut it's interesting er here at the look on our we use technology a lot to um to get the gospel of Jesus Christ out into the world\nBut I'm not someone once said that the Internet is where religion is go to die really yeah and I it's kind of an odd what do they mean by that well I I think that the the point is that\nWhen you have a faith of any kind um that talked about on the Internet you're exposed to all the other ones ... and you're exposed to people from all these different belief systems that they know this is the right point to notice is the right point or my way of saying here's the proof or this or whatever it might be\nI think it's partially because of the fact of um exposure and as I go back to the beginning of this when I grew up in the middle of a cornfield I wasn't exposed to anybody other than the six hundred people who lived in my town you know but now every religion every bought every philosophy that exists in the world comes to you\nAnd I think for many people that is a challenge and they don't know how to necessarily think through those things so I I think it's important on the one hand that as Christians that we use technology in a way that games are a hearing for the gospel of Jesus Christ\nAnd that proclaims that gospel in a way that um it's clear maybe even more than it has been in the past because\nWe can assume that people understand the message of the church anymore I'm with all these competing messages that are there so on the one hand technology is this great tool for us to use to communicate the gospel but also it presents challenges with other ways of looking at things sometimes that can be a challenge\nOr just for people who might not be as strong in their faith or thought about their faith that might challenge them as well I'm not that we should pull out of technology\nBut I'm understanding who we are and who we are and being able to articulate our faith clearly as we confront these diverse messages I think is extremely important with all of this technological change\nAnd as much as technology continues to change what remains the same is God's love for us in Jesus Christ and we reached that message each week here on the program\nAnd that's kind of beauty I think of Christianity is the goalposts really never move [laughter] it's a a Jesus has already kick that ball and and that game has been one of 'em and for us the method is the same the message that because of Jesus Christ\nThat the love of God you're here for you that the kingdom is here for you that there is a place that has been prepared for you by God in God isn't your enemy is not against you he once you to be with him forever in his kingdom and that comes through\nThe crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and wild things are changing you can never change that that's something that has is historic if something happened and it's something that regardless of what you're facing you can always go back to and say this is the one thing that makes a difference\nHe is the goalposts really never move from [laughter] you know it's a Jesus has already kick the ball and and that game has been one of 'em and for us\nThe message is the same the message that because of Jesus Christ\nThat the love of God in here for you that the kingdom is here for you that there is a place that has been prepared for you by God in God isn't your enemy is not against you he wants you to be with him forever in his kingdom and that comes through\nThe crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and while things are changing you can never change that that's something that is historic it's something that happened and it's something that regardless of what you're facing you can always go back to and say this is the one thing that makes a difference\nAnd the net crucifixion and resurrection we find our identity then as as people God\nOh and this is the kind of the beauty of it it almost a ... not only beauty but it's like a beautiful mystery to me are identity being connected to Jesus that in our baptism that death that we talked about that that that saves the world from soon\nWe are connected to that death so in our baptism we die and we rise with Jesus and our identity is directly connected\nTo the identity of the son of God and so when you worry about who am I a and he's changing times or how do people perceive me on Facebook and all these other a technological platforms\nThe real question that we should be asking is how does God's Ears\nAnd God sees as in Jesus our identity as him in him we have a diet and written with him and when he looked at as he sees through that death and resurrection of is on and he loves us any cares for us any for gives us and he wants to know who he is\nAt the same time that message is not an easy one it's perceived as foolish both by those who take religion very seriously and by those who don't Yeah Dr Hoffman talked about that the the foolishness of the message that the that is being preached and yet that is the message that contains the power of God for saving us\nYeah it's interesting because we talk about that Christianity is foolish now I'm On the one hand a person could say that and you think well that's a horrible thing to say I'm sure that's not correct but if you ever take time to look at it you know I guess it [laughter] um it it's foolishness to our human\nIndependence hall and we're streaming live online at the same on our show provides you with information from all types of businesses that will be

October thirtieth on digital now\nJust as they were not two sons almost guy there cannot be two emperors on or a great quote from the famous Confucius in Nineteen Minutes after the hour we continue with Stephen, Stephen ... are\nVery special guest on the book bully of Asian and white China's dream as the new threat to world order Steven thank you please continue on your thought about espionage what's happening in the colleges today and you're not making this up by any means because we need to hear this\nA couple of years ago I talked to Congressman Chris Cox about espionage it\nAt the United states this was after the Chinese had stolen or from the Clinton Administration the plans for every nuclear weapon we had ever developed in test that he told me at that time there were eight thousand espionage front groups and the United states that had been set up by the Chinese Communist party today Twenty years later\nI Would not be surprised if there were eighty thousand is a it's a huge effort it's labor intensive its capital intensive\nAh the trouble of course for the Chinese Communist party is they have a culture of corruption\nIn China which means that they don't innovate very well how can you innovate and by the where the person next to you is going to steal your intellectual property you know as soon as you have it ready to market and sell so they operate by\nStealing our intellectual property and then bringing it to market sometimes even before we can and then selling it back to us that's how the system thrives\nOr if you know we could cut back the espionage I\nThink we can cut them off at the knees\nBalloons gentleman you're out there The Revenge of the reason we have this radio show with the caller's rule here six zero to to southern southern five thirty six million recalled the show Lebanon eleven hundred others are coming out of church\nHeading to breakfast or just after your third cup of coffee we want to hear what you have to say this is really serious when we go about our purchasing power here in America we're we're become ... in my opinion just a nation as a gigantic mall\nBuying and selling products is great on the capitalist let's think about what Stephen's talking about his people to give this example because we're big fans of military aviation you look at the beautiful if twenty two\nI don't know all of a secret capabilities but I Do notice when I see an aircraft in the Chinese Airforce that looks very much is if you put it into the little reading machine and out pops in another look alike twenty two\nYou know if you're going to steal the technology guys and gals don't make it look exactly like our airplane but say you and I'm not trying to be funny this is serious stuff\nIt is and and the plans for the F thirty five of also apparently been filtered because China now as a new jet um that that appears very very similar\nTo our own F thirty five which we spent a billion dollars developing and if China got the plans or their development costs to practically zero\nOr it's this is even better than reverse engineering because reverse engineering made you have to get a copy of the plane and then reverse engineered if they get the plans for the plane I including the software of course then then they're one step ahead already uh this is going on every day it's a massive effort on the part of China\nLike twenty two you know if you're going to steal the technology guys and gals don't make it look exactly like our airplanes let's say you and I'm not trying to be funny this is serious stuff\nIt is and and the plans for the F thirty five of also apparently been filtered because China now as a new jet ah that that appears very very similar\nTo our own F thirty five which we spent a billion dollars developing and if China got the plans or their development costs to practically zero\nOr it's this is even better than reverse engineering because reverse engineering means you have to get a copy of the plane\nThen reverse engineered if they get the plans for the plane I including the software of course then then they're one step ahead already\nUh this is going on every day it's a massive effort on the part of China and for the first time however we have an administration that is aware of what China is doing and is is combating China across all domains and I'll tell you what a Chinese believe that that Donald Trump is\nA strategic ingenious [laughter] uh and and I can tell you why\nYou know and I'd like to hear the ...\nThe the the uh the Chinese think he's not only succeeding tactically by moving from one issue to the other getting as many concessions says you can and then moving onto the next issue they think of him as as attacking them across all domains that\nStrategic domain of the military doing made the the ideological domain um and and they have never been confronted with a presidency like this and the last twenty five years they've had a free ride across all these domains no one has really challenge them in the systematic way that that\nDonald Trump past and they think\nThat Donald Trump is practicing sons to the ancient Chinese strategists who wrote the art of war is the Supreme odd of wars to subdue the enemy without fighting and they think that President Trump is doing them in precisely that way well like trade\nOr by building up the military I buy this economic confrontation that we're seeing\nVery interesting show to do seven seven three six nine I'm ready for your calls ladies and gentlemen who was even W Moshe he's here today for just a short time but of course we'll have him back\nAnd I do appreciate depended and say thank you Steven for doing this because the story should really be on the front page of every particular newspaper and in the Internet world your information is very very powerful\nLet's let's hear what you have to say about a solution we cannot blame every single Chinese students for espionage that would be ridiculous but\nHow do we filter and stop the proliferation as you're describing of the festive intellectual property what needs to be done and it's not being done right now let me hear about that\n[laughter] well once not being done is there are a Chinese scholars here studying in universities which have Defense Department funded research projects to develop cutting edge technology clearly we have to keep\nUh the the Chinese scholars who are actually working for the ministry states parity and our security risk\nFrom having anything to do with these projects a we have an open society so art default position is to say come on in our work with us we're going to advance the cause of science everyone in the world is going to be better off that's not the attitude of the Chinese Communist party\nYeah attitude of the party is we're going to dominate the twenty first century ... century we're living in belongs to us well America's history and the best thing that America can do is step aside and and let us take our rightful place as the dominant power in the world and we now have a president who says no that's not going to happen\nSteven quickly on this one I Want to jump to many topics in the short amount of time we see Google was multi national\nAbout cutting edge technology clearly we have to keep uh the the Chinese scholars who are actually working for the ministry states' security and our security risk from having anything to do with these projects or we have an open society so art default position\nTo say come on and I work with us we're going to advance the cause of science everyone in the world is going to be better off that's not the attitude of the Chinese Communist party\nYeah attitude of the party is we're going to dominate the twenty first century ... century we're living in belongs to us well America's history and the best thing that America can do is step aside and and let us take our rightful place as the dominant power in the world and we now have a president who says no that's not going to happen\nSteven quickly on this one I Want to jump to many topics in the short amount of time we see Google was multinational corporation we see our version of the Internet and via Google\nThey are now working until this audience lives in detail I'm off the scholar on those\nThey're developing another type of Google there which has an incredible fire walls to deprive people of the most populated nation on earth\nOf the free an easy vote a bell veil ability of what they should be able to see to seek out the truth shame on Google for doing something like that I mean really it is all about the money I guess it is but let me hear about what's really happening is that a fair statement of what I just said of what Google is doing in China\nI I absolutely it it's a scandal of the first proportions\nA China has been building up the last few decades a great firewall you know the great wall of China great firewall that keep news and information about what's happening in China\nFrom the Chinese people so they won't know the people in the north won't know that people in the south or striking for higher wages needle in the west won't know that Chinese in the east are protesting government corruption\nUh they keep people in the dark and\nFact that that that Google should be participating in creating a search engine which will not only prevent the Chinese people from finding out the truth about what's happening in the world and in their own country but will actually automatically report them to the authorities\nAutomatically report them to the communist authorities if they search out things like Tibet\nOr Tiananmen and I'd been massacre your Taiwan or any questionable topics or they will be automatically recorded to the communist authorities and of course they will be punished or even carrying out a search why sought climbs climbs in China are punished\nYou know Steven where we're coming to the bottom of the hour hearing them and I just want to get this one and I've heard that like we have a credit score in this nation\nThey have a reliability or loyalties score that if indeed they sense that based on the questions in your answers\nThat you're a theoretical risks to the Chinese Communist party then your somebody that's not going to be treated with any kind of respect and I hardly imagine anybody over there having any rights what's the truth about that as we go to the break here in two minutes you have the\n... it's called a social credit score\nIt goes up if you say nice things about the Chinese Communist party and about the new red amber she gene paying it goes down if you\nTalk about a forbidden topics like freedom\nAnd democracy and human rights and the thing is if your credit score it gets too low you can't buy a plane ticket you can't even buy a train ticket you can't leave the city where it's heartening that can't get a loan for to buy a home or a car and\nGet this if you're a social credit score falls too low you will be arrested not because you committed a crime but because you are suspected of being on the verge of committing a crime and you're going to be sent at that point ... re education camps for two years\nIt's the truth about that as we go to the break here in two minutes you have the\n... it's called a social credit score and it it\nIt goes up if you say nice things about the Chinese Communist party and about the new red amber she Jane paying it goes down if you\nTalk about uh preventing topics like freedom and democracy and human rights and the thing is if your credit score it gets too low you can't buy a plane ticket you can't even buy a train ticket you can't leave the city where hardening that can't get a loan for to buy a home or a car and\nGet this if you're a social credit score falls too low you will be arrested not because you committed a crime but because you are suspected of being on the verge of committing a crime and you're going to be sent at that point right re education camps for two years\nTo wake up people in this country if you don't think what I'm saying on this radio show has merit\nOr from ships to anything that goes in the hardware software this is not stores in China because we know from recent reports that they have planted a little many chips\nAnd several boards that they had been manufacturing in China over the last Thirty years and they have penetrated probably thirty a different major companies and major government institutions and the United states with these tiny tiny Chinese spies ...\nHorses in around ... little little Trojan horses that that are just as dangerous as the original trade Trojan Horse was ... in terms of getting inside the gates and stealing information\n[noise] totally amazing Steven it's amazing and Sarah thank you for your call in so many people out there obviously the show should be six hours long and that's our intention loose ends on and we have some big plans for twenty Nineteen and\nStephen I certainly would ask you to be part of that when we reveal that in the future but quickly if you would comment on this something very closed everybody listening ladies and gentlemen I hear this often Steven at the time of the loving them eleven hundred it does conflict with many people's attending church so let's talk to the people who are maybe now coming at a church or going to church\nChristians what's going on in China the persecution of understanding that crosses are being taken down people are being what a actually a captured or put in prison\nAnd in the same light I understand that a large Muslim population is being watched segregated and put out into some sort of desert kind of prison camp but I mean describe this whole thing but start off with the Christianity say\nWhat we're seeing in China Today is a new cultural revolution and in the original cultural revolution under the ... that's all he wanted to stamp out\nTwenty nine teen and Stephen I certainly would ask you to be part of that when we reveal that in the future but\nQuickly if you would comment on that something very close to everybody listening ladies and gentlemen I hear this often even at the time of the loving them eleven hundred it does conflict with many people's attending church so let's talk to the people who are maybe now coming at a church or going to church\nChristians what's going on in China the persecution of understanding that crosses are being taken down people are being what a actually a captured or put in prison\nAnd in the same light I understand that a large Muslim population is being watched segregated and put out into some sort of desert kind of prison camp I mean describe this whole thing but start off with the Christianity say\nWhat we're seeing in China Today is a new cultural revolution\nAnd in the original cultural revolution under the ... film he wanted to stamp out all religious belief entirely because he thought that the Chinese people should worship him and his Chinese Communist party above all things and he put himself about God and so in the sixties they were tearing down churches\nThey were arresting Christians pastures and bishops in ordinary cue sitters that's happening again in China Today under the second red M. Hershey Jane paying well out and all that can read em proceeding paying thinks of China\nEveryone in China should worship the church that is China in his view of which he is a high priest and the Communist Party members\nOr the accolades serving him\nWell he has got to other ... he's got another thing coming in Stephen I'm going to try to squeeze in one more caller here and again ladies and gentlemen that'll be as many colors as we can take because that's what the forty five minute break we're going onto it for a recorded interview with Steven Cook with Mr ... Bhutto a former campaign manager for Donald Trump mark in Scottsdale good morning and your question and comment to Stephen\nWell there was about two hundred million Christians right now worshipping most of them underground\nAnd the the problem with China Today is that you've got a company like Google which is going to block out um filter out people's females and their Internet\nFor the Chinese government I Believe that Google needs to be shut down and there's a lot of other companies on the west coast that are anti God they need to be shut down because they're not our friend these tech companies are they're anti God\nGrant aid which means for anti patriots ... anti American so my question\nWhat is your game is set to go down and get real\nOrganizations back in the United states because they're being shut down here to\nYou mark your coming in a little later but you don't have to take your answer off air Steven if I don't get to say thank you before the break again Mike in my condolences to older people around the world that are being persecuted and affected by this craziness of totalitarianism and again I'd like to have you back but this is a very powerful subjective religious and sentiments of police continues to\nIt is a digital totalitarianism and signed up today there are security cameras\nEvery street corner in every city of China they have more\nCameras in China than any other country in the world and that more than all countries the world together big brother is literally watching all the time now\nThere is a strong and growing presence of Christianity in China it always shift Christianity always thrives under persecution and China is no exception they're well over a hundred million Christians in China\nThe number is growing ah the God that is communism has failed\nOr the one true God of course there's still a in charge of history and and the Chinese people are are coming to the faith in large numbers\nIt's amazing Stephen and there's so many other things but give us a concluding remarks for about a minute or two of the current president of China and um have you pronounce his name properly because I don't always get it right but here's the reason\nThere are security cameras on every street corner in every city of China they are more\nCameras in China than any other country in the world and that more than all countries the world together big brother is literally watching all the time now\nThere is a strong and growing presence of Christianity in China it always cheer Christianity always drives under persecution and

history\nAnd and the Chinese people are are coming to the fate in large numbers\nAmazing Stephen and there's so many other things but give us a concluding remarks for about a minute or two of the current president of China and um have you pronounce his name properly because I don't always get it right but here's the reason I'm not trying to be funny\nIs that he now has declared himself what he is the ruler for life I mean this is totally absurd and again totalitarianism off the scales police can doing\nWell he is president for life but he has more than that is not only the head of state as president is also the head of the central military commission so he's the general is about ... the general in charge is\nAlso and this is the most powerful position is also the chairman of the Chinese Communist party and that means he controls the crease centers of power in China the military\nUh and the government and of course the Chinese Communist party Ninety million members strong the largest

you really are\nWell I Do because I Know where you came from I Know what you're made of\nYou're not just flesh and blood you're not just traceable elements of earth and matter or even of DNA no you're

much much much more than that\nYou may claim your ancestry back to blood lines in Asia or Africa or Europe [noise] but I Know the tracing of your origins farther back then those roots you identify with that's why I Know what you're made of\n[noise] you and me and all of them well we all came from the same place and that place is the common ancestor troll pool of humanity\nOne of the\nReasons that we have so many similarities so many similar features and similar organics [noise]\nThe reasons we have similar wants and needs and even similar attributes is because we all came from the same place so despite the fact that there are forces at work that are constantly trying to divide us away from each other\nThe many similarities that we have unite us as one human family\nOne of the major divisional forces that human politics in politics there are individuals are generally operating within entities\nThat wants to hold a certain command over us and they've learned that if they use division they can gain the most ... because when they're pitting one group against the other than they have the attention of a large segment of the population\nFor logistical reasons they're not going to talk to you or to me personally instead they're going to be addressing crowds of people\nAnd they know that this is going to work on their behalf because they want to motivate large quantities of people and crowds can be moved and mass [noise] have you ever heard of the term a mob mentality\nWell that term acknowledges that if you take people and put them in a cluster or heard or a group [noise] then you can move them as if they are one of the crowd is going to be moved with rhetoric with prodding with emotional appeals\nBut a crowd in a crowd can still to be moved with reason because anxious crowds don't think\nThey only react and they can swoon they can mood taking his they can share they can have an air of excitement or an air of rage about them but as a group they cannot think\nIt takes an individual to process information better crowd will only react\nThis is another reason why you're so wonderful because you as an individual can think and reason and act and to perform\nRemember individuals have something that a crowd does not possess a brand\nBut a crowd in a crowd can still to be moved with reason because anxious crowds don't think\nThey only react and they can swoon they can mood they can his they can share they can have an air of excitement or an air of rage about them but as a group they cannot think\nIt takes an individual to process information better crowd will only react\nThis is another reason why you're so wonderful because you as an individual can think and reason and act and to perform remember individuals have something that a crowd does not possess\nA brain\nHad the capacity to use it to think that the reason\nCrowds tend to act emotionally but individuals are more prone to act with intellect\nA we serve youth up and page Twenty one because for our youth we know that they need that support in resource\nOften times or the first and their families to go on to post secondary opportunities so really it's a mentor and it's our program and that really provides that support even after high school so there is a match kind of closure that takes place or a kind of celebration if you will of that relationship\nAh once that kind of natural progression reaches where it it needs to be for the youth and so that could be after high school or it could even be up until age Twenty one\nHundred maybe there could be even a lifelong friendship wouldn't\nAbsolutely a destiny and I are actually just talking about that on the way here and that's me and I have been matched for about two years and the nature of our relationship continues to kind of falls\nKnowing that I'm working as her mentor to really meet her where she is and help provide that support and motivation\nFor her to achieve the goals that she wants to accomplish in her life and so um you know the transparent conversation that we've had is that you know I Will always be that support in her life whether it's through a formal mentor relationship or even after our matches closed after she's Twenty one\nWe'll still have that life on friendship um and really support of each other\nThrough because we're in our program dozens of dust and you've been with the program for how long for three years three years yeah and do you anticipate as you have to enjoy the benefits of this program [noise]\nYes I Do um being in this program is like a lot I eat a lot of support from it and yeah it's not from our little but everybody that then it ... so I get a lot of support from the staff and then other men to the program so [noise] um there's a lot of people that are friends with that came about that and\nFor her to achieve the goals that she wants to accomplish in her life and so um you know the transparent conversation that we've had is that you know I Will always be that support in her life whether it's through a formal mentor relationship or even after our matches closed after she's Twenty one\nWe'll still have that life on friendship um and really support of each other\nBecause we're in our program dozens of dust and yet you've been with the program for how long for three years three years and do you anticipate as you have to enjoy the benefits of this program [noise]\nYes I Do um being in this program is like a lot\nI get a lot of support from it and that's not from our little but everybody that then it ... so I get a lot of support from the staff and then other men to the program so [noise] um there's a lot of people that are friends with that came about that and you had to wait and they gave me the same support when I'm at school so it's not just from our love it gives me a great support system period\nI Would imagine it might even be a wonderful goal to storm the it'd be a mentor yes that is one of my goals or they would be an ideal or a natural progression you've been successfully help yourself into water level\nYeah because I see how much Marlowe has made a change in my life and to think that I could do that for someone else like excites me so\nI can appreciate that [laughter] so Marlowe what did you do just started making a change and goes to a newsletter or with the things that you started accomplish I think\nShe's being very generous because I feel like she is made\nUp I don't want to be really Frank I don't know exactly what I've done right I've seen her um progress I've seen her her grow I've seen are rich or as a young woman as a you know really someone that people look up to um ... having someone Seventeen now but I'll I'll Remember when she was sixteen she\nLet me know about the choices that she's made um being that she had been enrolled in the program for a little while she said you know what the friend group that I had when I originally came to new pathways is no longer my friend group\nThat have a sixteen year old that knows how to achieve our goals that knows how to surround yourself with the people that support her um you know really I've I've just tried to continue to be that constant support I\nSo I think she's really just because I don't know everything I Do but sides I listen I'm I I\nTry to challenge or I Try to coach I Try to ask questions [noise] um but I also know that my goal as her mentor to not over impose what I think she should be doing and our program really does teach our mentors and to really think intentionally about you know that each specific youth\nAnd what support we can provide them to achieve their goals so it's really been meeting where her where she is\nYou know being there at that support listening asking questions I'm fortunate that I had the support of a program coordinator at new pathways that checks in with me monthly to say\nHow are things going in the relationship what are some some of the support that you need so it's it's not just me alone I have the support of a\nA staff member um ensuring that I have the resources that I Need and and so it's it's better I think a mutually beneficial beneficial relationship I joke with her that I don't know who's mentoring to because I feel like I've gotten just so much value out of our relationship as I think that she has and I think that's the power of mentorship\nWell of course tutors and a new members you this if it plays out the widow of probably about as good as it's going to get a stream are loaded with Greg designs he wants to become a ... what are the branch says\nWell we're always looking for mentor it's we know that there is to use 'em that really do need that support and so there is an enrollment process if you will there it's an application that completed theirs\n... what are some some of the supports that you need so it's it's not just me alone I have the support of a\nA staff member um ensuring that I have the resources that I Need and and so it's it's better I think a mutually beneficial beneficial relationship I joke with her that I don't know who's mentoring to because I feel like I've gotten just as much value out of our relationship as I think that she has I think that's the power of mentorship\nWoman forced to do the numbers you the food plays out this way there is probably about as good as it's going to get a stream are loaded with Greg design as he wants to become a mental and what are the branch says\nWell we're always looking for mentor it's we know that there is to use 'em that really do need that support\nAnd so there is an enrollment process if you will there it's an application that completed there's an interview process that takes place and also because it's an adult being matched with the youth and without supervision there is of a you know the proper background checks fingerprint clearance\nAnd you know to ensure that that's a safe person to put in a life of the youth so after that initial kind of interview application and screening process is complete every mentor completes twelve to Fifteen hours of training\nAnd understanding the culture of poverty that are used enrolled in the program are coming from its understanding kind of what it means to be a mentor and what that commitment looks like and how to coach and challenge a youth so that they can help you know achieve their potential\nSo it through that twelve to Fifteen hours of training that the mentors develop that after the trainings complete they get matched with the use like destiny\nIs the mastering process related to anything that might already be part of part of the history of the person looks food are you going to consider family background religious background ... those things all of that\nPlays a factor and and the new pathways staff does a great job and ensuring that they have an understanding of the backgrounds of both a mentor and needed to ensure that the the matches really successful it's up to very intentional process when the match meeting actually takes place it's the the youth enrollment coordinator that's really speaking to the needs of the youth and then it's our\nAnd our volunteer coordinator that does that screening of the mentor to be able to say that it's the mentored background and it's through that kind of intentional conversation that they're able to ensure that the match it set up for success\nAfter we're doing pretty good what about um the parental in sort of how to use the the parents were\nIt's continuous and and really once you decide that they want to be a part of our program are um youth and parent enrollment coordinator actually goes out and have it has a conversation with the parents could ultimately if you're bringing in another adult and to the life of their child they need to be involved in that process\nUm and so the parents and generally is very engaged and involved they're the ones that are are agreeing to have their youth participate in the program and to be matched with a mentor\nAnd ultimately our our families are coming person challenging situations they want more for their youth they want more for their children and you know they're just maybe not at a space where they're able to do that\nUm and so it's it's generally a very supportive relationship that we have with our parents because they ultimately want the best for their youth\nAnd worse and we also provide a parenting programs to the same life skill development that our youth are learning and that our mentors are trained in our parents participate in it and as well so it's really helping our parents to understand\nWhat those life skills are that their children are are learning that they can implement in their own lives and for the youth it's really creating a common language and really a framework so they feel supported not only by their mentor but also by their parents as well\nOkay so are you saying that if I was a parent and I had a um a teenager I wanted to see them\nAnd ultimately our our families are coming person challenging situations they want more for their youth they want more for their children and you know they're just maybe not at a space where they're able to do that\nUm and so it's it's generally a very supportive relationship that we have with our parents because they ultimately want the best for their you\nAnd worse and we also provide a parenting programs to the same lifestyle development that our youth are learning and that our mentors are trained than our parents participate in it and as well so it's really helping to our parents to understand\nWhat those life skills are that their children are are learning that they can implement in their own lives and for the youth and really creating a common language and really a framework so they feel supported not only by their mentor but also by their parents as well\nOkay so are you saying that if I was a parent and I had a um a teenager I wanted to see benefit from your program would have been approached shoes\nOn the subject and then would you have to make it possible for me what do you what I Would like to be the mentor I Would like to rent or own my own children better I'd like to do a better job and I knew what do you ever program just for me the parent\n[noise] we don't have statistically if a parent is enrolled in our program it means they're used its enrolled in our program so so really that's kind of our current set up that we have\nAnd to be able to provide support 'em it's really more of what to her you need you know we're an organization for youths of element and so we look at our parenting program not specifically towards the parents but how do we create that level of stability and support for you\nAnd so it's really parents enrolled in our program it's their youth are already enrolled in our program so it's typically\nIn terms of that kind of referral process it's not a parent that's necessarily referring there to us it's the school district it's local homeless shelters that are identifying certain risk factors in these youths where they're showing signs of delinquency of dropping out of high school early and so it's\nThem making that first level of identification that we see not necessarily the parents\nBut then after that identification is made than it's communicating are programmed to the parents getting there by and if they are bought and then we invite them to participate in the parenting program\nOkay suppose those are the the the counselors out there at large are determined to this young man or a young woman needs a little bit of gardening\nUm and then the approach and the new pathways for use the news you know that there is a person that might be a good candidate for your program\nSo then you take the information you go out and visit with the parents because the parents say well I don't think I Want to do this then what do you do\nIf the parent doesn't want to participate in the program but they want to support their youth and they're allowing their youth to participate will definitely allow for that you to be enrolled we don't force her parenting program where it's mandatory for parents to participate but we do\nMake sure that the parent is committed to their youth participating in the program and signing off on can set that they would be enrolled in the program\nOkay well it sounds like a very positive thing all the way round I Would say would you would you say this to me that the three years that you've been in the program has helped you polish absurd he may be specific skills or is there anything you can tell us specifically above the benefits that you've achieved by a room\nTo make sure that the parent is committed to their youth participating in the program and signing off on can set that they would be enrolled in the program\nOkay well it sounds like a very positive during all the way round I Would say would you would you say this to me that the three years that you've been in the program has helped you polish upsurge he may be specific skills or is there anything you can tell us specifically above the benefits that you've achieved by name\n'em before my eyes to someone that can one recognize that to have that level of awareness and to to be that you know now that kind of mentor for those younger youth to say like I get I have an understanding of where you are but\nLet me tell you about how you can show up differently I mean that's been probably the greatest reward I've seen and probably the better better stories of just the experience in our program\nIt was very nice of you know do some of the it reminds me a little bit of when I was young I had a teacher in junior high school it was kind of like reached out to me a little bit and really acting like a bit of a mentor\nAnd helped me to get from my bad attitude do a little better when you're not going to my attitude was that bad but I just didn't feel like I fit in that and I held back and\nIf I didn't have the hand extended to me I Would probably be on my job is this\nKind of quieted reserved and afraid to speak to anyone but after you and I are sitting in front of these microphones and I guess we both grew up where do you want to do now that you've been subjected or I'm going to be subjected but her you've had the privilege of being able to have\nNew visions of new ... book before you do have any long term goals here already plotting\nYes I'm so beforehand coming into the program I never thought what I was going to do after high school I never got that late knows how to put this um\nThose like tool of going to graduate high school I was kind of just done in high school you're going to graduate you're going to go to college I was never told how to get into college had apply for scholarships fast or anything like that\nAnd then becoming in the program and how to model there and not much support system I realized what I actually wanted to do in life where my alarm turns goals I wanted to be and what kind of career I wanted to go into a kind of college I Want to go and like for right now\nI'm kind of stuck in between create so I'm really good at business and I loved it but I also love nursing so those are my two ... that want to go into so I don't know which one I'm going to the\nOld us very nice of you have to pass away now that you can choose and maybe you're leaving run into in a third one you just never know when life yeah but uh having the privilege of being able to develop and like a murder pointed out just watching you be able to become the person that you are and what that person or a little bit\nThat has been a wonderful experience for your life I Know yeah well it ...\nShips fat or anything like that and then becoming in the program and had in my little there and not my support system I realized what actually wanted to do in life and let my long term goals I wanted to be and what kind of career I wanted to go into a kind of college I Want to go and like for right now\nI'm kind of stuck in between create so I'm really good at that and that's and I loved it but I Am a lemonade stand so those are my two girls that want to go to so I don't know is showing them look on the ...\nWell that's very nice of you have two pathways now that you can choose and maybe you're leaving run into in as a third one you just never know when life yeah [laughter]\nBut uh having the privilege of being able to develop and like a murder pointed out just watching you be able to become the person that you are and let that person out a little bit that has been a wonderful experience for your life I Know\nYeah well it's because I like I said I was really conservative I was really quiet and now that I can expect on myself and different ways and now that I'm like making a difference and people it makes me really happy\nThat is one of the great gift we have I think as human beings as that we've been all in given the same set of resources it doesn't matter who we are where we came from we all can trace our origins back to the original pool of humanity and from the pool all the assets that humanity hands\nAre delivered to each one of us are sometimes it's just a matter of turning on the switch from that um I like to talk about the the positive side of life\nBut we also have the potential for being negative yeah and we have to go through life making determinations or sometimes about what we are going to do at that particular given circumstance\nAnd we all sometimes do negative things because we are that's part of who we are too and that's part of our potential but when you're doing something like this program\nNow you're focusing that you're throwing the light on the positive side yeah and you're being encouraged to throw that switch on all the time aren't you rather than just simply letting life\nGuide us we're helping to be involved in fighting life a little bit and when we choose to do positive things well we're going to benefit ourselves and all those around us that's just that's given to this this is a beautiful program\nTo help develop that I can see that but I wanted to ask you another question Mario about the relationship side of it I was\nThinking about how young people often get caught up in a a kind of peer pressure that is sometimes makes a very very low ceiling in their life\nAnd so introducing an older person as a beneficial part of their life is going to help a breakthrough that feeling a little it doesn't and\nWhy is this such an essential ingredient for helping a person to mentor and not just hang out with those who are of their own age\nI I think it's a couple of things I think one it's it's about exposure you know people that when you look at peer groups don't you don't use can be very one sided and can be very kind of close minded and I think\nWhen you let someone and who has a little bit more experience a little bit more you know life perspective on it really opens up a possibility that creates opportunities that and when you say really focus within your peer group you're not really seeing and\nFor these are all that new pathway it's many are coming from some really difficult backgrounds where it's actually you know adults you know people beyond their peak peer group have turned their back on them so often times the people that they're trusting really are only their peer group [noise]\nUm but that's part of the wonderful training and development that we have a mentor and said hey we know that you're going to get some resistance we know that they're going to look at you like here it's an old person trying to come into my life\nI I think it's a couple of things I think one it's it's about exposure you know people that when you look at peer groups don't you don't use can be very one sided and can be very kind of close minded and I think\nWhen you let someone and who has a little bit more experience a little bit more you know life perspective on it really opens up possibilities that creates opportunities that and when you say really focus within your peer group you're not really seeing and\nFor these enrolled at new pathways many are coming from some really difficult backgrounds were simply you know adults you know people beyond their peak peer group have turned their back on them so often times the people that they're trusting really are only their peer group [noise]\nUm but that's part of the wonderful training and development that we have a mentor and said hey we know that you're going to get some resistance we know that they're going to look at you like here it's old person\nTrying to come into my life and I'm not quite sure about that and I've had I've been burned in the past by other adults and so I'm going to stick with my peer group and not necessarily fully engaged and we develop our mentors to be unstoppable to continue to you know be there to be that constant presence to\nContinue to just you know be at a table president ultimately after I Would say to various but six to eight months is when you finally have that breakthrough in the it's recognized that okay or you're going to be there for me and you know yeah your perspective that you're sharing with me is different than what I thought about and\nI can see possibilities now that we're beyond you know kind of what I was currently seeing so just I think it takes time\nUm but it really it's about exposure it's about showing the youth that you know there's different opinions are different thoughts there's different ways that you can approach things that are beyond what you're saying within your current peer group\nBy Russia that just driving down here today I was looking out of the uh the desert and you know the desert just started to get very green and why is it getting green because of exposure the exposure to to the rainfall\nAnd the more rain we have the green or we're going to get as a human aren't we more exposure we have the better it could be if it's good positive exposure and all that was asked to bring it may not be too good trimming around\nBut it's just what it needs this kind of experience you're introducing through new parents ways for youth is the kind of greening up in their lives I Know that will bring benefit for them it's easy to see that it's a good thing\nI think what you was you were just talking about is really key because when young people get caught up or not only young people any people at any age get caught up with a peer group that only has a very narrow perspective of life um then they're inhibited [noise]\nDo the things that they can do and where they can go and how they could grow\nFind very grateful to me in my life I always had parents who introduced me to people of all ages and we didn't have any kind of prejudice or anything like that was going through life I Know this is difficult for many people because they're raised in environments that might be quite so narrow\nAnd what you're doing is opening up to opening up a new door for someone who might be in a narrow space to help them uh open up and see a broad new world out there it's almost like they're the little girl by going through the hurricane and Kansas or the tornado coming into the colorful new world in the yellow brick road is\nWe call him try on that new pathways so another their day a new experience and so and that's the name was approach last year to to present\nAnd all of that it was that's needed for going to be a try out for you and you know are you going to going to show up to be your ... and really you know fully appreciate that experience and opportunity and her response was yes because that's going to bring me closer to my goals and so you know I think about that kind of a a lot\nMany people because they're raised in environments that might be quite so narrow\nAnd what you're doing is opening up to opening up a new door for someone who might be in a narrow space to help them open up and see a broad new world out there it's almost like the little girl by going through the hurricane in Kansas or the tornado coming into the colorful new world and the yellow brick road is\nYeah we call him try on that new pathways so enamored of their day a new experience and so and that's the name was approach last year to to present\nEyes and you know all of that it was that's needed for going to be I Try out for you and you know are you going to going to show up to be your ... and really you know fully appreciate that experience and opportunity and her response was yes because that's going to bring me closer to my goals and so\nYou know I think about that kind of a a large example but even so smaller but I think one of the first times we hung out she hadn't had sushi before\nAnd so it's something just as little as that you know it's just okay let's try on let's try on a different type of cuisine you haven't had before and so it really it's small but it's also when you think of a life skill development piece of also additional opportunities where these youths are getting exposure and supportive an adult that opening their eyes to new to new\nThings um ... destiny how was the sushi it's it was really good I like it yeah [laughter] easy to fall in love with him\nAnd food is such a beautiful dry on whenever you learned something wonderful Judi you never know what you're going to come away just totally enamored with when it comes to that I can tell you the\nBecause I've been a world traveler all of my life there's nothing that has enriched me more than ... billion to different people's cultures and give me a new people around the world and I have friends everywhere are just so grateful for them because\nIt helps me knows that no matter what our here in the news or anywhere else I Know that the way things really are is that people are quite beautiful and they will be there for you they will be your friends if you just give them an opportunity to be that\nWay well what about what else Marlowe would you like to share about the program that might be on the tip of your trunk\nFly off that's a great question um well I think I've provided a lot of perspective and you know from from the mentor side which I I fully appreciate um one of the things that's really unique about our organization and about the ... the work that we're doing it the fact that it really is\nThe lives of everyone around [noise]\nToday it was a brief religious people coming in prison where his friends\nAnd we're going to look forward to

no way to know if you're buying a deal that was profitable deal because you were trusting the real estate agents to give your data\nAnd if you go way way back their data wasn't even computerized and it was simply listings that we're in what they looked like magazines at that time\nAnd that was held the listings they're each month to get a new set of listings type of deal later they started having

they're telling you what stuff is worth now I'm not saying the real estate agents were scrupulous or that they misrepresented\nI'm not making that statement although I'm sure there were some of them

well we went to break up like you just walk through until people the multitude of things with the software does for you\nI was thinking of the right you'll be really understood and if I wanted to share that I went back and I did occur in the database a couple of months ago and over the last ten years that we had the appraisal five or ... to ... million or\nThat's sales at ... radio network dot com\nLooking back you're some more money you wish you the man on a mission to retire within one\nLooking back to do once in a radio show with me here today is teeming Janice who's the developer of the lifestyles discovery appraisal software and a demon as I said when we went to break it like you just walk through and tell people the multitude of things that the software does for you\nI was thinking of a over to our you'll be really interested in and if I wanted to share that with you I went back and they did aquarium the database a couple of months ago and over the last ten years that we've had this alright appraisals offered there have been two million evaluation stop\nOh wow why a lot and and then like when I started in ... years ago it took about twenty minutes before we have to stop doing evaluation now take like a minute or two so much ... I calculated it saved about fifty nine years of productivity\nWith all of the evaluation that people have been doing\nA pretty good pretty good tool for Europe [laughter] um so so what the system does is it\nReally simple to use which made the program even harder to make it simpler but it makes them more powerful so what you do is you go and you enter an address that subject property address that you want to evaluate\nAnd it takes it crunches numbers for ... back in time that brings up a screen and it shows you\nWhat the sales value it for the property and a confidence level associated with that and then it shows you if you rent value as appropriate what your rent or and the confidence about those are the first two bits of information that you have and in most cases\nYou can just go with us numbers now there's also a feature where you can look at detailed comparable so you want to see what all the properties are\nSimilar to the subject property how much they sold or in the last three or six months and it shows you all that information um and and occasionally you want to go and the confidence is low on sale or went by and they want to go and what has to be tough but most of the time you don't even need to do that because the data so good\nUm and then what also happen is a pre spells out to cash flow calculator and\nAh and all you need to do is put in like ... you want to but again based on that value that you stop at what price you want to\nDo you plan on purchasing the property for so you put in those two pieces of information and the calculator crunches all the numbers\nAnd ended up at like instantaneously very very ... so what it tells you how much cash out of pocket\nIt will require to purchase property and that depends on your financing whether the conventional loan or hard money around private financing whatever it handles all this scenario is still tells you how much money is going to take to to purchase the property\nAnd then it gives you a poor people's information to tell you if it's a great deal or not and that is it it shows you the ...\nYou have your annual cash flow and then it will tell you you're ... percent return on the capital gain and percent return on the cash flow\nAnd so once you have that information\nOr which again just takes just a few seconds generate very very fast\nUm when you you can say okay that was like a a really good deal I Want to move forward with it or\nNot and I'm just gonna go check the next property so you know you can you can run through the maybe the you could do to him in the morning when you're eating breakfast and and this one term really quick and just stay on top of that and they get a feel\nSo once you have the evaluation of course there's just been keeps track of all that and\nPieces of information that telling you\nIf it's a great deal or not and that is it it shows you the ... you have your annual cash flow and then it will tell you ... percent return on the capital gain and percent return on the cash flow and so once you have that information\nOr which again just take just a few seconds generate very very fast\nUm then you you can say okay that was like a a really good deal I Want to move forward with it or\nIt's not and I'm just gonna go check the neck property so you know you can you can run through the snake so you could have ten in the morning when you're a breakfast and and this term really quick and just stay on top of that and I think it was a deal\nSo once you have the evaluation of course this has been keeps track of all that and uh and you can um you can go back to the previous evaluations and take the numbers and\nUm you can make copies of the evaluations can export them in a Pdf file them into your real estate agent\nUh can um do all kinds of things you can add notes the evaluation that you can remember here that we're making\nYou know it's a really come a long way to ... the the problem that we had in the past was that we couldn't get the correct information now we're not only getting the information you're giving us a percentage of accuracy\nOr how does act as a software program come up with a suspected percentage of accuracy\nYeah it's really interesting because uh the the data that's being used comes from multitude of course like I have the MLS you know if I'm at the data available there's public information there's private information that companies have the data providers that we're using\nAre collecting all of this information and depending on the source it's more reliable or less reliable and so they have a an evaluation model that it kind of an algorithm that goes that based on all of the\nInformation for this particular property law sign of confidence too and that reminds me of something I Want to mention of quite a lot of people will go to a low in order to do their evaluation because they'll have like a sail value on a ... I have to be very careful with that because their data is\nIs very problematic I had a subscriber emailed me about a month ago\nAnd he said you're you know I spoke discoveries showing it at this property is worth a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and Phil is calling it's worth a hundred and eighty thousand dollars and I went and I looked at the comparable and there's no way that property worth a hundred thousand 'cause all the ... or like a hundred and Fifteen hundred and thirty thousand dollars\nAnd so you know the softer space on making a huge mistake and going and pay too much for the property but that daily access these phone party and then the confidence\nYou know that's a sign of a sale value and the rent value is so helpful because you know when you get like a Ninety five percent confident on the wrist like all of your dad you know I have to worry about that in a very powerful\nYou know I remember reading an article once and it was a long time ago so don't remember the exact percentages are so I welcome you to look it up on the Internet to verify what I'm seeing a for everybody's listening but I read this article ... had gotten sued\nBecause people were making decisions on on data that wasn't an accurate ... had to come back and part of the restitution was to admit\nThat they were like only Ninety ... they're like Ninety five percent inaccurate in other words if they said it's worth a hundred and ten thousand dollars there is a Ninety five percent chance the wrong not right but some ... no I don't\nThat kind of a failed I read about you is so helpful because you know when you get like a Ninety five percent of them on the wrist like all of your dad you know I worry about that it was a very powerful\nYou know I remember reading an article once and it was a long time ago so don't remember the exact percentages are so I welcome you to look it up on the Internet to verify what I'm saying a for everybody's listening but I had read this article ... had gotten the sued\nBecause people were making decisions on a data that wasn't an accurate ... had to come back and part of the restitution was to admit\nThat they were like only Ninety they're they're like Ninety five percent inaccurate in other words if they said it's worth a hundred and ten thousand dollars\nThere is a Ninety five percent chance they're wrong not right but raw some ... no I don't know if that meant they were run by one dollar or one hundred and five dollars and you follow what I'm saying like Ninety five percent of the data was wrong that was just blew my mind\nAnd I probably should look that up where I stayed there but I'm I'm welcome you to look it up and see how close I came to that\nAre yeah I but I think I heard about that and it's a it's been a problem and and and then my you know when we were evaluating that\nProject a year ago and I study that data from different providers and I was working at the landscape I ... a parrot too and I left there there are there you know all these different parts of it and as bill was consistently and you know off of what of what the numbers but I Would think\nThey just have to be real careful I met a professional investor should not be used in free data\nTo can be very evaluation\nOr they'll Israeli ... you know they get paid for next year for oh about the age of ... but the great business model\nThe company that we're getting data from they get paid because of the of the day that they're providing and so you know your petition to investors and private investors and bank cetera argues the data that we have available at my country\nAre well I Want to thank you for coming up we're coming up to a break here uh lifestyles discovery dot com take your free seven day trial offer and uh go see what ...

have been um I was blessed I was I'm married to my high school sweetheart for over Thirty years\nAnd uh did we argue about money well maybe a little bit [laughter] I'll just go right there but then in two thousand fourteen I found myself single and I needed to figure out money and so what I did is I went on a a personal quest to become an expert\nAnd as I became that expert and over the course of time I realized I loved\nPersonal finances\nAnd when I looked around I when I asked my friends to help me figure things out they weren't able to so they did not know no one that I could find to answer

tract that's right which which\nIs the worst thing in the world [laughter]\n\nJust start off with how would you describe goody got health\nYeah so good got health to me means that we're proving one to three times a day we don't have any bloating or discomfort in her stomach whatsoever our elimination isn't nice large tubes you know if that was really effortless moving and so much goes into it that\nThere is that saying that I think I've mentioned before that death begins in the colon\nWe've heard that yeah absolutely and so we just have to be so mindful and this is where we hold our stress right into we could feel stressed impacting our got health environmental things you know in fact I got health drinking alcohol not sleeping I'm\nTaking medications like antibiotics there's a lot of different challenges in our gut when chemicals come into contact with the 'cause that's basically our where immune recognition is that's what I've heard as well\nSo you use as usual you give us the most full there okay\n[laughter] if I could remember sorry\n[laughter]\nI mean you you've been the key to why it's so important with a lot of things that you're kind of when you when you kind of rattled off all those things which I agree with because I certainly some of them impact me personally\nWhile come back we're talking with Dr ... from the center for natural healing on many topics have healthy living in Eighteen or well and I want to ask so we talked a little bit before the break about how bad health effects are mixed but how do our new fact our got health than mhm\nYeah so then what is it a name you talked about how our minds create the health of every single cell ... um and you know he describes how you can\nYou hear the children with cancer at the good role model you give them pictures to watch that show like packing eating it they can literally from their brain start dissolving Kansas how our minds affects the health of every mhm\nIt's an encore presentation [noise]\nWelcome back we're talking with Dr treats around me from the center for natural healing on many topics of healthy living in a chain of well and I want to ask so we talked a little bit before the break about how that health effects are men it's but how do our new it's a fact our got health than yeah\nYes so rude slipped in what is his book name he talks about how our minds creates the health of every single cell ... and you know he describes how you can\nHe he used the children with cancer as a good role model if you give them picture to watch that show like packing eating it they can literally from their brain start dissolving Kansas how our minds affects the health of everything mhm so\nIf one were chronically stress or running too fast is impacting our guts we didn't feel if we can feel the holding tension in our guts\nYou know and so of our mind believes in stress similar got got will always be instructed the same time would you do the belly breathing right to expand our our abdomen we're spending money then they can serve to calm our mind sounds it together like we're always working back and forth\nBut we're not just a victim to thing you know that's why I wanted to make sure that we're educated enough to know how to re labels mhm and that we're I'm mindful enough to go down to so that our cells or health can turn over really ... effortlessly and in a healthy way\nSo just living a fast paced worry for life affects our gut healthy could strip are\nYou don't do any gardening antibiotic brain right if you're going fast your reminds me of the things is throwing the ball you something else exactly\nYeah so I have to be mindful of what we're\nDoing Sheila crossing stress can sometimes cause us to lose our appetite and then we're not taking anything good and I you know I Know that when I get stressed out and that type of thing it's like I just I I don't even want to eat\nOr anything like you know and then other people will overeat now yeah ration treatments how unique yes people are um neither one is great but we have to have some sort of a reaction right and what we want to create more of our responses you know because the more reactive we are the more information that we have right\nOkay she'll be wishy if I can get the street here [laughter] the last like why don't we all know what I mean a loss but sort of\nShow what goes into a good will affect your mood during and with the same to them or brain will tell or ... was you know what what the what the what to do right to replicate yes so and so it's kind of is a really a trigger type good conversations are ... other than mood what other kinds of ... can one expect\nWhen there's something going on and I'm I'm assuming there's also some lot of physical ...\nYeah there's and there's like ... in the last decade or two books written on\nHow that affects our mood and affects our um metabolism one ingrained brain I Know yeah ... ... talks about how so many of the brain issues whether it's ... ADD autism like how grains affect the brain didn't like vegetables and talked about we belly\nAnd what the gas due to how we source that I'm fat you know do you know it's it's where interchange have it as a huge highway highway is is not block and there's no accidents and things are running smoothly that's how you're healthy got can influence the health of your body so you know\nI guess you didn't really ask that question but\nWe know that you know the modified grains affect us negatively in our moods and in our house so it's a double whammy um you have to get you must get cranky when you eat certain foods\nTry to figure [laughter] the middle ages of ... guy\n[laughter] [laughter]\nUh no no but I don't I just want you know I just wanted to think is that you know why do some time for example and maybe you hit on this and the Miller missed them\nHow grains affect the brain you didn't like vegetables and talked about we belly\nAnd what the gas due to how we source that I'm fat you know so you know it says where interchange have it as a huge highway highway is is not block and there's no accidents and things are running smoothly that's how you're healthy got can influence the health of your body so you know\nI guess you didn't really ask that question but\nWe know that you're not the modified grains affect us negatively and our moods and in our house so it's a double whammy\nUm you have to get you must get cranky when you eat certain foods\nTries to figure [laughter] that marriage is the correct your guy [laughter]\n[laughter]\nUh no no but I don't I guess where you know I just wanted to think there's a you know why do some time for example and maybe you hit on this and the Miller missed them what are some time when I have a glass of wine I really feel it my guts and the same one other times not so much right exactly and I get I get that sense happening right now saying what's going on here\nYeah it could be quality of the line it could be how your day went okay\nWhat you ate last mhm I'm what you moved west before you know so there's there's lots of moving pieces\nAnd some people you know and this is like with the mindfulness movement are trying to be aware of themselves enough that they know that when they're hungry to not drink wine or something you know like to just kind of identify triggers or cause and effect\nAnd so it we are different every moment and I have to do that sometimes like wow why did you get a plane like why did I did the Right rally online right this minute\nYeah or even if you know issues of national when for example if you drink the same line because you like to write home and I was fine yesterday when I had one but two right usually go to all of a sudden today it's a it's a problem\nRight now and maybe you took an allergy medication or um maybe you didn't take your probiotics that day like ... and you got that especially also like we talked about what did you eat that day that could have inflamed you're got so that you put it in the climate to remark chemical in\n... yeah ... ... okay so let's talk a lot to talk about for ... comes naturally you I think the conversation flows what's the connection between good health and our immune system\nRight right so because eighty percent of our music and lives in our small intestine or got is our immune system mhm okay so\nThere's a lot of people that don't poop everyday love people that you maybe have diarrhea\nAnd I think our number one health goal should be to optimize our elimination pattern because then we know you know so I Believe in I Do ... every quarter if I get sick I Do the more frequently just because I Know that my immune system um I Know when I'm not eating well\nI don't know that after a while especially as you get older and you you have this ... loose abacus up there to try to yeah tells you lie right you beat yourself up right up twice\nTo then I Know what I Need to do at home like there's a really high dose probiotic hired I take every day that if I had a bad day whether it was emotionally or eating I'll take this probiotic and I'll actually feel it kind of coming down on the receptors in my got a we didn't talk about it yet but\nI don't know if you know this Sarah toning is a ... um hormone that we make in our brain that makes it happy mhm\nThat same um it required the receptors hard for us to make their tone and we have more serotonin receptors in our guts than we do in our brain ... so whatever we do target is affecting our moods through this Arizona receptors\nAnd diverse for making a lot of us are toning were happy or come our our digestive tract will become too and if it's um\nIt's something inflammatory came into it let's say food poisoning mhm we may be more efficient that feeling of that every one of us has got to get sick with food poisoning right how quickly we recover is determining based on how quick healthier got ... micro biome is and what we used to heal and that's I think a basic thing is that we all basically because we're living them\nTake this probiotic and I'll actually feel it kind of calming down all the receptors in my got a we didn't talk about it yet but I don't know if you know this Sarah toning his ... um hormone that we make in our brain that makes us happy mhm\nThat same um it required the receptors Hartford us to make their own and we have more serotonin receptors in our guts than we do in our brain ... so whatever we do to our guts is affecting our mood through the serotonin receptors\nAnd diverse for making a lot of us are toning were happy or come our our digestive tract will become too and if it's um\nIt's something inflammatory came into it let's say food poisoning ... we may be more efficient that feeling of that every one of us has got to get sick with food poisoning right how quickly we recover is determining based on how quick healthier ... micro biome is\nAnd what we used to heal and that's I think a basic thing is that we all basically because we're living the modern lifestyle take a good probiotic or doing something really good for her so\nRight so what are the different ways our immune system expresses disease\nSo big it when I can think of his allergies mhm seasonal allergies sneezing you could congestion mhm um food allergies can turn on um\nDifferent genes that cause a auto immune from right which is inflammatory their names for those we've really those patients have to really watch their food and I'm at a few young girls right now right now that they really are\nIt's just like a bittersweet thinks they're grateful to know how these who's making inflame putting all their friends are eating them so it's it's a it's like a very sure they get inflamed and then they'll either food you know it's it's really an interesting educational time I think for the decade because I even think you know we put it together with the\nUm what is it they have or all of our electronics that age from ... ... you know in our all of that in fact our whole nervous it's running we have to keep up and that's why we have really good you know gravely I Need them to a really good self wants to help\n'em with all these transitions ... and so when I say a good probiotic is number one then we'll talk about ... by addicts as well you\nJust want to make sure you're getting a good one one that's been studied for um inoculation meaning that it it it here's your wallet and and you know otherwise you might be taking or something like that not necessarily\nRight yeah 'cause I've actually taken probiotics that didn't agree with me right and I I really felt it yeah and then you actually got me on a ... that I Love yeah and so I've been taking that one right here look so you have credit where credit's\nWell would you take furlough already what you look for on the labels and when you look for ... it's going to be or is it once again everybody's different in terms of how the except the probiotic is I\nThink everybody's different totally different and you know unfortunately the label claims over the counter you know there are a lot of ah I don't know what you call this but like if there's a really good products made by a company that other people are making the same wavelength that but it's not the same product it All right you can buy Amazon so I don't know it's kind of scares me right now that there's so much so\nBut it's also a blessing because Everytime I hear it after you take away a vitamin C yeah so we can't buy or something like that makes me nervous that I really don't like\nCompetitors out there are giving a bad name I mean it's right or Senate yeah it'll be educated and working with somebody so yeah yeah so you actually brought up a really good thing that I probably shouldn't even be I should mention that ... that somebody would take a label and put it on something and not as effective as okay and when you really do have to be careful\nLikely winner brand label and a generic things ... that type of and you know and her down and that happens on you know some of these different websites for I Know we're going to be doing it was heartbreaking but let's just you you talked about this before in ... you know misinformation peach right\nSo the inflammation as part of it was caused by what we put in her stomach ultimately going into the small intestine regular the guts\nBut it's also a blessing because Everytime I hear that you can take away a vitamin C yeah so they can't buy or something like that makes me nervous that have really been a\nContender is that there are getting a bad name means my fortunate you have to be educated working with somebody yeah yeah yeah you brought up a really good thing that I probably shouldn't even be action and that ... that many ... take a label on put it on something that but not at the facts and and it's okay and you really do you have to be careful\nLike we don't know I mean the brand label and the generic type things makes it that type of\nDamp and a half and I you know some of these different website\nI Know we're going to be getting a heartbreak here in a minute but let's just you you talked about this before in the you know misinformation ... right\nSo the inflammation is part of his cars but what we put in her stomach ultimately going into the small intestine right near the guts right and then to combat that we use either we use supplements like a probiotic things that will help because we're\nThere's not necessarily the case ... it is what's gone into that sausage for preservative aspect that type of thing okay\nAnd a lot of fast food is process for it so fast food differ stopping on your way home you know for dinner and and grabbing something most of that has been packaged in you know frozen enhanced chemicals in it and that kind of\nThing you know I guess but it's helpful I think of talk about that only in the sense of for example by you know I don't have a lot of things don't McDonalds there's a good way of getting older but you still do like to fry share more during the era yes definitely [laughter]\nKnow the things that you know so I think there's the whole idea or what what do you identify as processed foods that we hear so much was usually important\nRight yeah it definitely is and as far as an immune and I don't mean to see just does I'm selling extent these fall under that category not fight nine and ... is the thing that that causes it so how can we improve our um immune that health right what do we need to deal\nYeah so okay we don't want to eat packaged foods very much\nAnd if we do and so just give you an example of that you can understand it from a lay person term like the guy goes on my day I feel fine and then you know I I'll get inflamed\nAnd I know I've had too much fun you know I've ... I've just kind of become to relax right you know with my own tradition and then I just have to dial it back you know maybe it's too much scary but it was a time when I had severe allergies are blaming it on the environment until\nI did identify through my food allergies the hill now I don't have allergies right sometimes I'll feel the threshold though ... I Know that I'm In an inflammatory cascade right now so\nUm that's number one is just identifying you know overload\nBecause you know we overload ourselves like in building yeah\nSo how can we improve our um immune ... health and why do we need to do\nYeah so okay we don't want to eat packaged foods very much\nAnd if we do and so just give you an example of that you can understand it from a lay person term like like I go along my day I feel fine and then you know I I'll get inflamed\nAnd I know I've had too much fun you know I've ... I've just kind of become to relax right you know with my own tradition and then I just have to dial it back you know maybe it's too much scary but it was a time when I had severe allergies are blaming it on the environment until\nI did identify too my food allergies the hill now I don't have allergies right sometimes I'll feel the threshold though ... I Know that I'm In an inflammatory cascade right now Frank so\nUm that's number one is just identifying you know overload\nBecause you know we ... ourselves like in ... [laughter] yeah\nYou know we wouldn't do that [laughter]\nSo you know it's\nTime to indulge would you really want to celebrate those special days and not being in every day occurrence and I don't know about you guys but\nI attract a lot of patients that and I'm In I'm not judging it but I'm saying a health perspective drink alcohol every single night of the week and that's dripping us in stripping us every day instead of like rejoicing and celebrating and making it a nice time kind of like looking forward to it around and so that our body just says wait a minute to much\nWas already well as long as you're on the subject to him because there is it from your perspective is there any kind of um alcohol um consumption that's better than any others or any worse than the others\nYeah there there is because um we want to alcohol\nFermented sugar right road and we want to get the least amount of sugar right here and there was another condition which I didn't bring up I don't even have down to the question but it's such a common thing I don't want to forget it\nAnd that's how common um candy to over growth no no I Can't do it as a part of our micro biome which is it has to be there but when a ... more prolific than our probiotics than we actually have not necessarily use infections that could be a veterans of action but it's if they make you were tired we're gaining weight\nUm we just don't even know what's going on that probably used we're creating sugar\nOkay and so that is um I guess if the cleanest alcohol would be a a a non grain\nPlease say a good glass of wine [laughter]\nI wind up as an inflame you than wine is good looking I Want to get a good\nLaugh here's what it does to your system right now you're you're the one that can tell what hosts impact yesterday I you know you ...\nBut I Would say in general the alcohol that is most people I'm a jury's beer in most of the laboratory interesting there's a lot of these tenant used sugar yeah up all you yeah\nWell you write in before we go on and all the roads so we don't forget before we go any further in ... contact you learn more about the center for naturally you don't want to forget\nThat

bad in your political or happen that's happening here politically to the president and blame him for it particularly that has to do with the dead journalist\nA dead journalist even if he has ties to

much but there's that journalists boy oh boy and man of course is Trump's fault just like everything else in the world that goes bad is Trump's bowl\nThese guys are ridiculous anyway this Saturday a foreign minister is out today with an official statement saying that they're going to punish whoever did it\nThey're going to\n... and and they call it a crime and huge mistake and express our up to the family I don't know what these people expect these people to do now I don't trust the Saudis either I get it okay\nBut before we know what happened\nWhy assume the worst even of them is ... and walk and tell you why because Trump is trying to forge a new level of\nAlly with the Saudis in order to keep control of some snake pits here in the middle east\nAnd or [laughter]\nAnything they'll look ... make Trump look bad you're going to go after so I think he's handling it he's threading the needle exactly right our president is with this subject\nAnd comparing it to some are flippant justice upside down where you're guilty until proven innocent just happened with the cabin of fair and uh I think they're doing the same thing with this although it's there is no comparison obviously except that particular a jurisprudence comparison\nBoat true voices of Arizona independent ... eleven hundred KFI to\nYou when you fall down and you'll be bullied\nBut true voices of Arizona

in the article five hour I'm dating me at least your host thank you for joining us this find Sunday afternoon we're broadcasting from the studios of independent talk a lot in our campaign next here in Phoenix, Arizona\nAnd a riding shotgun with me today is Mr Kim O'Connor he is\nA long time Republican\nMover in shaker here in Arizona are pretty good guys in my opinion so we're happy to have you here thanks for being here today Jim\nMy pleasure joy day good to be back with you again\nAll right so what we're going to do is we're going to get down in numerical order the state wide propositions that's coming up on the ballot\nRight here in sixteen days folks now there's early voting thing going on for ten days or so already in the state of Arizona I'm I I personally\nAm against that [laughter] I think that you know there should be maybe a window but it sure as heck shouldn't be thirty days I mean you could change your mind six times and thirty days I Know lots of people that do that\nUh anyway so Jim first off we have proposition one twenty five tell us about what that is and and what we ought to do with it in your opinion sir\nI'm a I wanted to address the audience first\nI'm as voters we have a lot of work and a lot of individual responsibility when we fill out these ballots in five instant since here\nWe're going to be voting whether to change or not\nOur state constitution that and when ever we monkey with the constitution we've got to be extremely careful extremely precise and know and understand each and every on intended consequences excellent also starting now as the basis\nLet's knock out these five for that or statewide issues that everyone will be voting on a our ballots are big again in this election cycle front and back on that enormous sheet of cardboard we'd get\nTo cast votes I Do do the early ballot because I spend all of the election days visiting the polls in my legislative district um I wanted to\nAbility when we fill out these ballots in five incidents since here we're going to be voting whether to change or not\nOur state constitution that and when ever we monkey with a constitution we've got to be extremely careful extremely precise and know and understand each and every on intended consequences excellent also starting now as the basis\nLet's knock out these five for that or statewide issues that everyone will be voting on a our ballots are big again in this election cycle front and back on that enormous sheet of cardboard we get\nTo cast votes I Do do the early ballot because I spend all of the election days visiting the polls in my legislative district\nUm I wanted to uh first of all say that my reporting today is not original\nUh although I did do my own homework I Want to credit the Maricopa County Republican committee or Maricopa County Republican Party I also want to give kudos to the Arizona free enterprise club which has done a lot of great thorough research\nI'm On a lot of great great research on economic issues and there are quite a few of those in the ah ... on on the ballot additionally I Want to\nGive credit to the center for Arizona policy action group\nOr they created the center of Arizona policies five oh one C. three and can't make recommendations about like heritage they created an action component or where they can come out and give recommendations and they provide every voter on line with or\nJust the probably the most robust interactive voter with\nUm you know with research that that I've come across a website ah Mm good question hold on\nA age CSI voter guide dot com [noise] uh\nAnd that Center for Arizona policy\nSorry I didn't have that at the tip of not having a ... we'll get we'll get into a well oiled greatly than again before so so now let's let's hit a prompt one twenty five\nA prop one twenty five essentially a maintenance the state constitution to allow for additional legislative reforms to the correctional officers retirement plan\nWhile they unlimited in scope the proposed legislative reforms will reduce future liabilities and pension debt for taxpayers do boring subject driving the tears\nTrying to go through pensions but essentially um this is smart business and it's a very good decision to vote yes on prop one to five\nWhat about the argument\nAnd uh that many will make that these people were promised that on the onset of their job and now we're changing the rules in the middle of the game so to speak that is the devil's advocate position I\nUnderstood but I I come from a corporate America background not a government employee America background and with respect American corporations Thirty years ago\nBegan converting from defined benefit plans where I retire and get three thousand dollars a month 'cause I was a good worker for forty years to defined contribution plans\nThis was smart business and it's a very good decision to vote yes on prop one to five\nWhat about the argument\nAnd uh that many will make that these people were promised that on the onset of their job and now we're changing the rules in the middle of the game so to speak that is the devil's advocate position I\nUnderstood but I I come from a corporate America background not a government employee America background and with respect American corporations Thirty years ago\nBegan converting from defined benefit plans where I retire and get three thousand dollars a month 'cause I was a good worker for forty years\nTo defined contribution plans and the reason there is an American corporations just like American governments\nCan go out of business\nIf they spend more than they take in so when interest rates went to zero which they banned that about a dozen years or so next to nothing from the old eight nine ten eleven twelve percent rates\nThey couldn't get the earnings to deliver the benefits that were promised yeah so that was the main thing that corporation did or the government\nAnd also they were probably over promised to begin with a man so there you go I just wanted to address what them the main one against that voting yes on this proposition was going to be but yes on one twenty five okay\nRight I'm trying to think of the New Jersey governor a nice job he fell oh oh oh Chris Christie Chris Christie spoke\nTo the police and fire unions got booed when he he said I don't know what you're doing me for I'm In here telling you guys the truth we don't have that it's the guys who were here before me promise and you're the moon and they were lying to ya yeah they're the ones that need the Boeing absolutely you're not only that would be\n... yeah it was on one twenty five folks some of them are my uh 'cause I really I honestly I you help me with that I wasn't sure what to do with that one myself but usually if you're going to spend more money are going to save money spend more money no save money yeah [laughter] I usually\nSo let's jump to one to six I'm and these are all pretty short I think one twenty six I'm the free enterprise as recommended a no vote as has Maricopa County Republican committee\nBut there were a number of people including myself the thinking yes motives the right answer and that's another tricky one so let's let's review prompt one to six\nThat would amend our constitution to prohibit any future changes to Arizona's tax code related to service taxes your doctor you'll lawyer your stock broker your real estate agent\nUm while the club opposes higher taxes and this is the free enterprise club we're talking about\nWe do not support locking our sales tax code in the constitution into perpetuity\nAdditionally taxpayers are already protected from all future tax increases under the old prop one oh wait which requires a two thirds vote of the legislature before raising taxes\nUh I'm of the mind that's the strongest point in their argument we already have a safety valve the protection so we don't need to worry about it but each and every opportunity I have is a voter to say no hell no\nYou'll lawyer your stock\nBroker your real estate agent\nUm while the club opposes higher taxes and this is the free enterprise club we're talking about we do not support locking our sales tax code in the constitution into perpetuity additionally tax payers are already\nProtected from all future tax increases under the old ... one oh wait which requires a two thirds vote of the legislature before raising taxes\nUh I'm of the mind and that's the strongest point in their argument we already have a safety valve the protection so we don't need to worry about it but\nEach and every opportunity I have is a voter to say no hell no tax increases I Want to double down\nI'm I'm with you on this one this one I had no equivocal patient out I was a yeah before this program before it I instinctively knew that we should vote yet to one twenty\nRight and that and we stand together with India but we're being opposed by a a number of smart Republican players as well well you know smart is a relative term [laughter]\nWell that's a very well researched okay um so now the the next problem that we're going to deal with is one to you might want to hang on to one\nRight and you actually after your campaign in the primary for corporation commission had said that with a Mr Glassman identity and you actually came out within the doors meant for him did you not\nI I did after a day or two hours shall I say come to Jesus meeting\nYes sir okay so Mr Olson Mr Glassman the Republican corporation commission it's very important we're not talking about candidates today but in this case we will because of this dire money is being filed it into the polling a tax probably ...\nCorrect and also vulnerable because of that save money combined with Soros money and other big left to use money is moving against our a Republican secretary of state candidate is moving against our attorney general\nOr for reelection so fully do see what I hear it's got a Seventeen point spread against Garcia I think\nI think that this is pretty safe but\nUh we have to support Steve Gainer accurate ... said well how fine man out of the business world decided to jump in and and you know throw his life away and become a politician\nThey have the right guy with the right tools at the right time and he will do us proud particularly cleaning up voter fraud\nExcellent excellent now we didn't want to get off\nA tax probably ...\nCorrect and also vulnerable because of that save money combined with sorrows money and other big left these money is moving against our a Republican secretary of state candidate is moving against our attorney general\nOr for reelection so fully do see what I hear it's got a Seventeen point spread against Garcia I think\nI think that'd be pretty safe but\nUh we have to support Steve Gainer I could have Harriet stayed out fine man out of the business world decided to jump in and and you know throw his life away and become a politician\nThey have the right guy with the right tools at the right time and he will do us proud particularly cleaning up voter fraud\nExcellent excellent now we didn't want to get off and candidates but not so far people ... you should have written down yes for one twenty five yes for one twenty six and not just no but hell no for one twenty seven All right moving out we got time for another one [noise] what's the next\nA next up is propped three o five and this is a referendum\nThat will expand Arizona's empowerment scholarship accounts which are referred to as he as a as\nA to allow parents to send their children\nTo a private school of their choice the ESE programs kept that only thirty thousand students remember we have over a million students K. through twelve in our state so this program is the max has kept at thirty thousand or just infant past small percentage of of that\nUm and includes transparency and accountability measures in the program the\nFree enterprise clubs supports this as does Center for Arizona policy action or support to yes on a three oh five um because it it expands choice and opportunities for parents and students and that ... three o five is step in the right direction\nExcellent him now thank you for that background on three o five 'cause I was confused by this one and if I was confused on that I'm sure many other people were so they're actually make school choice stronger in Arizona correct\nIt it it does do that and it saved every a tax payer an Arizona money right now we the people pay approximately Ninety six hundred dollars to educate one student K. through twelve annually\nThe maximum amount that um they get under this particular program that three o five the ASA accounts is fifty six hundred so that the differential a which is roughly ... just shy of four thousand dollars\nIs a tax savings for every one of the students where the parents choose to take advantage of this program\nExcellent excellent so we have a yes on free all five let's try and squeeze three of sick then before the break here\nAlready three oh six were also a yes or in twenty sixteen\nIt was discovered that candidates that finance their campaigns with taxpayer money now let me explain this I just went through that experience myself what we're talking about are\nWithout without a partisan flared damn Republican independent green name that tune\nYou can step up and qualify for funding from the we the people pocket and that's clean elections so clean elections funded my primary campaign and there's nothing wrong with clean elections whatsoever however and twenty\nYes I'm Free oh five let's try to squeeze three or six in before the break here\nAlready three oh six were also a yes or twenty sixteen\nIt was discovered that

there's nothing wrong with clean elections whatsoever however in twenty six being in that election cycle the Democrats funneled over a hundred thousand of those monies given to their candidates by we the people\nTo their political party instead of fixing the problem the clean election commission which is not a Republican controlled commissioned by the way codify the abuse and even expanded the rules\nTo allow public funds to go political special interest groups as well as to the party itself ... three I was sick just common sense that says\nThe cookie jar is closed no more takers you qualify for the money is a candidate you use it for your candidate see you have money left over you give it back to the people\nYou give it back to the state treasury them\nIf you give it back to clean elections who holds it in there\nThey have coffers exactly her all day so we have to the next election exile All right I get it so we want to yes on three oh sexy I didn't know which way to go
