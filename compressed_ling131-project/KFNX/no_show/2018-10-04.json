instead of\nInstead of stepping in and just being present with an amazing experience right in front of us were looking for these quick little hits constantly\nAnd that can get us out of being

definitely in the president of vibration\nTraining ... six so to to seven seven eleven hundred extension one for six three\nSix o two to Seventy seven eleven hundred extension one for six three\nBut true voices of Arizona independent talk eleven hundred KFI next\n[noise]\nWelcome to the mad at the time with Michael and\nDenise [noise]\nAnd um we are going to continue with some interesting I'm sure store [noise]\nYeah so um [noise] these days\nIn the last I don't I mean the last decade or so manifesting it's been a big buzz word mhm so I had a few experiences my life kind of before I knew what manifesting was the one one happened in college and I'm forty to this is going back to you know Twenty years ago roughly herself but\nUm I got a package in the mail one day and for my dad was a large jump up and I opened the envelope and it was actually a playboy calendar and that's nothing like my dad I think he where he worked there was one time she or he went send it to me at least an hour and that part\nTo open up and I literally pulled out this play by counter have my hand right here oh very interesting we there's no naked in front of don't worry\nAbout [laughter]\nFunny part was when I looked at the girl on the cover there was something about her that I found as she was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life\nNot from the guy's like oh look at her kind of thing it was the most innocent like oh my gosh she's so beautiful she's so beautiful and I showed all my friends innocent in college and they were the typical like oh let me see her naked or let me see this\nUm I ... I got a package in the mail one day and for my dad was a large envelope and I opened the envelope and it was actually a playboy calendar and that's nothing like my dad I think he where he worked there was one are you sure\nIt wouldn't send it to me at least part of that part [noise] open up and I literally pulled out this play by a counter have my hand right here oh very interesting we there's no naked designed to do or not [laughter] the funny\nPart was when I looked at the girl on the cover there was something about her that I found as she was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen in my life\nNot from the guy's like oh look at her kind of thing it was the most innocent like oh my gosh she's so beautiful she's so beautiful and I showed all my friends innocent in college and they were the typical like oh let me see er naked or let me see this or that I think no no no no look at her she's beautiful and I was moved by her\nThere was something very innocent in in that um [noise]\nHer picture meeting my game it was just so innocent like my God it must be nothing ever seen well\nThat two weeks later I'm ... I'm watching TV in a commercial comes on the monster truck show that's rolling into town I'm In Providence Rhode Island at the time you know like oh win a date with a playboy model blah blah blah and say okay I'm like you said the name like that that girl\nI call the radio I Won the contest a week later I'm eating dinner with her here's a product Sean Carroll glacier is\nThat is still alive so it was the complete maybe show the yeah it was a complete wild\nA child in the wild child like innocent that I Believe attracted to my life mhm 'cause it I mean it made no sense\nI mean I don't go to truck shows or anything like that I Know right and just the fact that this person shows up in Providence and it was a really powerful experience mhm and it again it was the simple childlike wonder man that is my from that story and other stories that have that the belief system I have that it's\nWhen you could step in that way she really is and isn't it you said like oh I don't think she was innocent but go ahead well\nI'm sure she had like all of us right we have it all inside of us right so the innocent piece of her\nSpoke to the innocent piece of me on some guy it was a very sweet interaction um and I wonder recommended that for anybody because it was their funding it was me sitting at a table with these two models they won dates with\nAn about seven ... radio um salesmen who they didn't have innocent intention let's say the least but\nSo I realized when you put something out there innocently it's not about trying to get your hopes and your claws into something it's like oh this is all this is a really beautiful experience I Would love it's in my life it's very simple it's very sweet\nIt's like a little child seeing something like oh wow look at that very much just simply innocence of it as well\nAnd that night many years later right I'm a I was a big New York Knicks fan and they had the draft and there was supposed to pick the uh there was a young guy from Poland and not my background as punishment ... my grandparents or polish and\nHe was supposed to go in the top of the draft and there was something that happened he kept dropping in the draft and they showed the seven foot young child bases Eighteen years old the seven feet tall and he's crying on the TV because his dreams are just being shattered right in front of him\nAnd every team is passing on I mean I felt so bad for my ... having an emotional connection because the empathic\nPerson myself I see this person just crying on TV and I'm like oh he had such hopes and dreams today and streams are being shattered I felt so bad for him and he was polish I had the polish parties supposed to be really good I have some connection on there\nWith my team into drafting him in the draft later on and there was a big scene he points to the crowd the whole place is going crazy and I was I had this connection I started a watching him play\nThere was a young guy from Poland and not my background is polish my ... my grandparents or polish and\nHe was supposed to go in the top of the draft and there was something that happened he kept dropping in the draft and they showed that the seven foot young child basically he's Eighteen years old the seven feet tall and he's crying on the TV because his dreams are just being shattered right in front of him\nAnd every team is passing on I mean I felt so bad for my ... having an emotional connection because the empathic\nPerson myself I see this person just crying on TV and I'm like oh he had such hopes and dreams today and streams are being shattered I felt so bad for him and he was polish I had the polish parties supposed to be really good I have some connection on there\nWith my team into drafting him in the draft later on and there's a big scene he points to the crowd the whole places going crazy and I was I had this connection I started a watching him play him on my video games I wanted I was wanting him to succeed so bad ... well you get treated\nThey just treated the Phoenix I'm In New Jersey so I'm like oh I Can't believe they trade this guy will then life comes in changed my life completely I'm off to Phoenix in a in a flash who's my next door neighbor\nKidding no so I end up being friends with him I said I end up taking his girlfriend all the games I Lived the life of hanging out with an MBA player and this person three thousand miles away\nAnd I just happened to move right next door to him to my friend lived in a condo and I just moved in and um now he's my friend and we were just having this experience sounds like my God that's so and so\nSo again it was from innocence I saw this young kid I connected with them and I just had this oh I wanted him to succeed you almost felt like a brother energy is very simple and very sweet wasn't not in my wildest dreams that I think to get anything out of the experience so you're attributing it to them the\nChildlike wonder men of just oh it's amazing oh my God we got this player is so exciting and you feel that that can lead to the action I feel like manifest de do 'cause I feel when we when we had that experience we lived our magnet up right and we start moving towards something and as we do that\nThe thing we're moving towards with its magnet up and it comes in because things don't always come in in a linear fashion they come in and directions we don't we see coming ... to ... if we just trust in step in without trying to get her hooks and things so I think a lot of people like I Want this car wants his car because I'm going to get\nA get a lot of attention I Want to drive fast it becomes this thing I got to get this job to make lots of money\nIt it kind of changes the innocence of the situation\nOh so the more we want something\nTo become a that energy is very intense it can be until it by going against the balance Fallon\nEspecially getting into with why you want something ...\nSo if you want a car I had to wear the Prius I Do I put a previous on a vision board a few years ago\nAnd I went out and got another car I was like I don't want a payment anymore me to get a nice kind of little fancy used car had checked out\nI Love this car that was a sob five days after I bought it the entire engine blew a I was like All right I guess I go back to having car payments again\nAnd I ended up getting a Prius and it was not the color and wanted but everything else perfume like black and like this color and then eight months later I'm going through my stuff and all of my vision working two or three years before it was the exact same car\nSame here same color exactly the same car\nNext car I feel like just showed up in my life\nWhen you said ... ... what does that mean sure so vision board is when um it could be literally a cork board or I'm just a phone board and you cut out two pictures of things that move you in life things that you want to experience it could be you a picture of France you wanna go to Paris\nIt could be a picture of um somebody in shape because you want to get better health when you sit there with your vision board you actually\nKind of little fancy used car had checked out\nI Love this car that was a sob five days after I bought it the entire engine blew a I was like All right I guess I go back to having car payments again\nAnd I ended up getting a Prius and it was not the color and wanted but everything else is perfect but I can just color and then eight months later and going through my stuff and I put my vision working two or three years before it was the exact same car\nSame here same color exactly the same car\nNext car I feel like just showed up in my life\nSo when you said ... ... to the listeners what does that mean short so vision board is when um it could be literally a cork board or I'm just a phone board and you cut out two pictures of things that move you in life things that you want to experience it could be you a picture of France you want to go to Paris\nIt could be a picture of um somebody in shape because you want to getting better health don't you sit there with your vision board you actually take a little bit of time and you you sit there you get a hundred percent president with what you're looking at and then you let your imagination run wild what would you like if this came true\nIn just the innocence of it if it's a car sit in the car with imagine sitting in the car the windows down your favorite song playing and just imagine what it would be like innocent just Adrian little children ... dream all the time about getting into your deep dream flexing your daydream muscles you will\nSo it's really getting back to how we we were and now I Would uh as a child mhm I Would think sometimes maybe hip no therapy that journals writing how can that ... what are some of the\nYeah so those are some amazing things you could do you can get back to the basic to being a little child again the division boards amazing tool I used that many times in my life and things have shown up I'm\nWriting it out like you said journal ... one of the things I Love to just go out and get in a car if something if you want to ... test drive it ... it just to just sit in it even if it's a fancy car that's OK doesn't mean it has to come true this week right\nMine came through about a year after I started doing the vision board in fact that she put the vision bored away and it still came true because I spend a lot of really beautiful time because I wanted the previous 'cause it would save me money so I could see my daughter and more like a travel more I could go up north outside of Sedona collect spring water is big on that came from very simple reasons why I wanted\nMhm Ashton distressing to preach isn't going to get your checks [laughter] right I Can't stand it [laughter] [noise]\nHow fascinating wow\nSo you mentioned division boy mhm and you mentioned you're on a link mhm [noise] and I'm sure there's no doubt that there's a few different things you could do you could actually\nMeditating into it just meditate literally closing your eyes and just imagining ... and against the feeling and if you're not sure if the thing that you're looking for is going to give you the feeling bypass that and go directly to the feeling\nMhm there's there's a bigger wisdom out there than we have in our little brains so if we can go past the stories in the past what we think it's possible and go to the end result and work backwards we have no idea what will show up or how will show up nature doesn't come into linear nature comes in from all different directions ...\nIt's possible you go to the end result and work backwards we have no idea what was shorter how will show up nature doesn't come in when you're nature comes in from all different directions ...\nIt's the same things sometimes things need to happen in life a little bit or maybe something needs to cook for us we have a little bit of a little bit of faith to be have that persistent inconsistent innocent passion\nAnd sometimes it takes a little bit of time or a few years ago Twenty years ago probably at this point I was in New Jersey with Thanksgiving Day that's watching football and on the either going to commercial that showed a like a very ornate Thanksgiving dinner table and as they banned it showed up pecan\nPie I Love pecan pie I was like oh pecan pie I Would love a pecan pie\nDing dong doorbell rings around downstairs it's my friend's little sister holding a pecan pie she was ... he told me you love pecan pie I was just happened to make some last night here's view and like you can you name it literally with thirty second\n... so who knows it's just\nPutting it out there more right you're putting it out there but you will a very uh well guided I Would think\n... and ... but it's also it comes from a place without trying to get your hooks and that's you know if I could see these innocent passion childlike wonder ... in staying out of trying to get your hooks and no manipulation right\nExactly 'cause we're the ... men nip the late things ... the less we become what we are right and we can't begin to ourselves\nRight ... even when I left the corporate world that we're seeing clients undecided gone to school at a nice you know nice check coming in ... and then one day I just looked up to whatever is bigger than us and said you know helped me out God universe whatever just just help me I have to give me the kick in the ass and need I Need\nTo step out of my safe safe zone mhm but did I did it I'm innocent pleading\nThe next day I walked in the work they laid off twenty five percent of the company\nI was there ten years I was the only person in Arizona they get like go\nEveryone around me crying and like well I kind of really asked for this yesterday I was like oh that one came in really fast [laughter]\nSo I took it as a science to that I write I Need to step into my path and do my work mhm wasn't easy and part of it there's a little bit of being scared but I also saw some wow this is really this is really big and divine that what has happened\nBut what I made that plead or whatever it's bigger than us it was innocent I have worked did you ask people to help please help me step into this next role\nAnd it gave me the opportunity and I stopped\nSo what role is divine intervention\nIf any yeah sure it's part of it is trusting mhm so\nHave my friends make fun of me because I always say something is interesting now why do you\nEveryone around me crying like well I kind of really asked for this yesterday I was like oh that one came in really fast [laughter]\nSo I took it as a sign to that I write I Need to step into my path and do my work mhm wasn't easy part of it there's a little bit is being scared but I also saw some wild is really this is really big and divided which has happened but what I made that plead or whatever is bigger than us it was innocent\nI have work to do after people to help please help me step into this next role and they gave me the opportunity and I stopped so what role is divine intervention any yeah sure it's\nPart of it is trusting mhm\nSo I have my friends make fun of me because I always say something is interesting you know like why do you always say that my mom because the parents and the things I thought really stunk turn out to be the best thing for me so now when something happens I think it's interesting\nBecause I've also at the times like this is the best thing to happen in three weeks later my grew I Wish that didn't happen so I just kind of trust that there's a there's an intelligence it's bigger than my intelligence\nAnd sometimes these things come out of the blue or if I'm looking to manifest something calling it in I'm going to trust in the bigger guidance than I Am that can help put it together and bring it to me ... because again it doesn't always come in the direction I think it's\nComing in you know I don't always like to think they have plans\n[noise] you know ... with a way it's work mhm relationship it's one of the plant that children don't have plans and they just show up they just jumped right right so um what is the lesson with that\nIf you're if you're guided if you feel at a moment of inspiration right step into it right now that your inspiration to go sing on Broadway maybe you can't make it happen today mhm but maybe start singing the shower and then you start singing at the local um these little club summer\nYou take the baby steps and you keep moving into that inspiration mhm and as you step into that place of wander amid an innocent passion dishes were other things started rushing towards you you may say that's five years away as you move your forward maybe that moved to a year to forward to you ... and things happen quicker\nMhm [noise] so the into a little odd\nIt could be yeah if you if something shows up or you may watch something on TV and like oh a piece of you might get laid off that you know you never knew like oh there's something there\nI mean so many people who are um maybe in their fifties or sixties or even or Seventy to suddenly discovered that the desire to dance by taking up all from dancing and it's it's just smoke and I can think of three people have to um head or sixteen about\nWith her whole life they didn't want to dance and sunny something shut up they went to like Arthur Miller studio another dancing and this is like their favorite thing they do it suddenly the hobby they ... they always wanted that they never knew they want it\nMay be a

was a terrible miscalculation on the president's part and I have to ask why does he do this\nWhy is it that when President Trump is in the White House setting he controls himself but when it gets in front of a crowd he makes believe or he sounds as though he's speaking on a telephone\nTo a television personality who calls him all the time\nAnd I think that's the problem I think what happens he

and saying that the president was merely stating facts and then he was not mocking but I'll tell you what I'm going to do\nIf the president was mocking Christine forward I think said she ritually deserves to be mocked and then some and let me tell you why\nWe have heard for years now especially in the post Harvey Weinstein era of about the last twelve months or so we've been told that when a woman makes an accusation that woman must be believed\nI say women must be taken seriously and there's a minor difference if somebody makes an accusation that is a serious accusation one that could lead to jail time in some cases could lead in this case to the end of an entire man's career that he has spent more than forty years building\nI think that you should take her accusation seriously but if it turns out that she's made the accusation falsely but it's not based on much of anything\nAnd then she can't even name witnesses who remember what she remembers and if it has the effect of holding up the entire country holding up the nomination of a new Supreme Court justice holding up certain cases that will not be heard by the Supreme Court\nEven Brett Kavanaugh is as I expect he will

word just maybe twenty minutes ago the five law enforcement officers have been shot in an active law or active shooter situation is going on in Florence South Carolina they apparently have a suspect in custody officials say that floor for three four Orange County deputies\nAnd to foreign city police officers were injured\nOr wounded conditions unclear at this point I Will give you more information as it becomes available but just sparrow thought and say a prayer\nFor those officers and for their family members and their colleagues I'd appreciate it tonight we'll get to the information as it's available a we've been talking about the various accusers of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd whether or not their stories are legitimate or not the more time that goes on the more we seem to find that contradicts those stories and suggested they were not very well established at all but\nThe GT TV networks seem to be ignoring some of the best evidence out there that is coming in from folks and I thought I'd get ... draining on who's a senior news analyst for the media Research Center ... glad to have you back on the program\nI'm Glad to be back with you and I mean on\nSo tell me about this there is one big piece of evidence in a letter that was written by the former boyfriend of a Christian Ford or the the big TV networks seem to be ignoring to some extent tell us about that\nYeah basically a Fox News I got a copy of this letter or that or an ex boyfriend of of course in for a sense of the Senate Judiciary committee and it was basically him telling them\nListen you know when I was dating her for her for six years she told me specifically things that contradict what she said in her testimony up the Senate Judiciary committee hearing a namely that you know she was asked specifically by the prosecutor Rachel Mitchell\nDid you have you ever advised anyone on how to take a polygraph test or anything like that and\nChristine Ford said no but her ex boyfriend in this letter says no actually she told me in detail about actually advising people on how to do a polygraph tests on what it is\nWe have this letter or that or an ex boyfriend of of course in for a sense of the Senate Judiciary committee and it was basically him telling them\nListen you know when I was dating her for her for six years she told me specifically things that contradict what she said in her testimony that the Senate Judiciary committee hearing a namely that\nYou know she was asked specifically by the prosecutor Rachel Mitchell did you have you ever advised anyone on how to take a polygraph test or anything like that and\nChristine Ford said now but her ex boyfriend in this letter says no actually she told me in detail about actually advising people on\nHow to do a polygraph test on what it entails and how to prepare for and you know the whole process so that seems like a you know glaring contradiction with what she testified under oath about\nYeah she does trying to do if if you lie under circumstance like that it's perjury even though it's before Congress and not before a court and this wasn't just a man who dated or some of that six years they live together so they were in\nClose proximity and they were they were at that level of a relationship he actually said in one of the cases I witnessed Dr Ford\nHeld Monica McLean her best friend at the time prepare for a potential polygraph exam she explained in detail what to expect how they work and help McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nThat say significant answer because she directly contradicted that under sworn testimony and yet how much time or the networks spending on any at all\nWell ABC and CBS or completely ignored it this morning on our morning shows and uh NBC it was mentioned by making Kelly who I have to get main kind of credit she has been one the only people on the block outside we're actually trying to\nBe a journalist about this story and cover all of the facts that are coming in so she covered the today show did not cover it so from seven AM to nine AM you could not find the story on NBC\nBut at nine am you know once every body is at work no longer at home watching the show then that's when finally Megan Kelly brought this this story to light on on NBC or for the\nYou know a minute or so and that was it so yeah they have not touched the story I rarely and they're not very interested in that\nKyle I'm Talking to college running from the media research on the other issue\nBecause and I want people to understand why I think this is so significant and that is\nIf you have a case that is entirely he said she said in other words there aren't any other witnesses there's no physical evidence of the crime of the salt that she says Brett Kavanaugh committed against or thirty six years ago so you have to either trust her testimony\nOr trust his testimony is being accurate so it's very important to evaluate whether somebody is trustworthy and whether or not they tell the truth\nUm she also had testified in was questioned about the after\nEffects of this terrible you know incident that happened and she described the Jews claustrophobic that her new how she insisted it had to have to separate front doors instead of one\nAnd that she was so you know frightened of of or claustrophobic that she couldn't fly for the most part could not fly on airplanes except in extreme occasions or this letter from the boyfriend a contradicts that doesn't\n[noise] yeah I Know basically it's it's ... yeah she said that the second front was right as a result\nThirty six years ago so you have to either trust her testimony or trust his testimony is being accurate so it's very important to evaluate whether somebody is trustworthy and whether or not they tell the truth um she also had testified in was questioned about the after\nEffects of this terrible you know incident that happened and she described the Jews claustrophobic that her new how she insisted it had to have to separate front doors instead of one\nAnd that she was so you know frightened of of or claustrophobic that she couldn't fly move for the most part could not fly on airplanes except in extreme occasions\nOr this letter from the boyfriend\nA contradicts that doesn't\n[noise] yeah I Know basically it's it's ... yeah she said that the second front was right as a result of you know the trauma related to that sense it and\nBuy it turns out well not all of that separate front door was so you know she could see clients you know have have been doing a separate entrance or when she meant you know see clients at home I mean she's a psychologist so it like that was the the ... it was already practical\nProfessional reason that really does not match with the reasoning that she gave in her testimony\nRight and she also also the the question about flying I I Know that early on it was established while she said she almost was incapable of flying that she's actually gone on vacation flight to her she flew to French Polynesia she flew to Costa Rica and the boyfriend describes that they took frequent\nFlying trips together even including one on a small propeller plane and apparently she was able to do that but she was telling the Senate Judiciary committee that she might have to drive from California to Washington DC because she was so frightened of flying on airplanes\nYeah now and then he's yeah that was one of those things that was even sort of fact checked in real time by Rachel Mitchell pointed out well you you have flown on other occasions we we know you have so why you know why the wire you suddenly afraid of flying\nYou know in this situation so yeah I mean there's the media has been so obsessed with trying to parse every single word and praying that Brett Kavanaugh years meanwhile there's these glaring contradictions that you know Christine forward\nYou know has made here in in her testimony according to this this ah ex boyfriend on earth you know they should be examining that just as they should be scrutinizing that just as much as their scrutinizing everything Brecht animal have to say\nYou know I saw a new twist and I call you'll have to be watching for you know that the FBI's review or their for their background check I think is the way they're describing it was delivered to the White House a short time ago today they expect that a copy of it will be sent over to Capitol Hill\nHere shortly but then I just saw Richard Blumenthal the man who himself\nYou know the senator Who Lied about his service in Vietnam he had said that he served in Vietnam during the war he did not in fact serve in Vietnam during the war\nHe lied about his service he's now on suggesting that he's read the other six background checks there were ... done on judge Kavanaugh and that they're full of other reasons to question whether or not they should vote on this do you think Mitch McConnell is going to get to a vote this week and do you think this justice is going to be confirmed\nWell yeah I think it's it's there is always a new twist and turn on every every day with the story I mean that's it you never know what what what they're going to come up with max but uh\nI mean it's really everyone's watching you know of course Collins Murkowski flake there the the undecided votes here so I mean you know Richard Blumenthal and the rest of the Democrats are already said hey we are not\nAbout his service in Vietnam he had said that he served in Vietnam during the war he did not in fact serve in Vietnam during the war\nHe lied about who served as he's now on suggesting that he's read the other six background checks there were ... done on judge Kavanaugh and that they're full of other reasons to question whether or not they should vote on this do you think Mitch McConnell is going to get to a vote this week and do you think this justice is going to be confirmed\nWell yeah I think it's it's there is always a new twist and turn on every every day with the story that made that's it you never know what what what they're going to come up with max but uh\nI mean it's really everyone's watching you know of course Collins Murkowski flake there the the undecided voters here so I mean you know Richard Blumenthal and the rest of the Democrats are already said hey we are not learning for this guy and I'm not a lot\nThen that's perfectly okay it's diversity most of the Trump Administration is now investigating this from political the Trump Administration is investigating whether a Georgia school district's policy allowing transgender students that is\nBiological male students who now dress and called themselves by female names\nAllowing those transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice led to the sexual assault of a five year old girl the investigation is happening in Decatur, Georgia which opened last month signals a major development in the education secretaries\nPolicies on transgender bathroom access Betsy devise\nHas handled things differently than the previous administration the complaint alleges that the girl was assaulted in the girl's bathroom at ... elementary school by a boy who is identified as and this is where these things get even stranger he's identified as gender fluid which means\nHe could be male he could be female\nHe may decide from time to time that he's a boy and he may decide from time to time that he's a girl the complaint was filed in may with the help of the alliance defending freedom which is a conservative group is filed many lawsuits challenging school district transgender bathroom policies nationwide\nAnd I would tell you that over the last two years probably the suspect these subject\nThat has generated the greatest number of emails the greatest number of tweets the greatest number of Facebook post directed to me has been about this subject because so many parents out there look at the policies and they say you are creating a situation\nThat is at best uncomfortable for my daughter or son at worst\nIt puts them at physical risk of harm\nUnderstand what's happening target the big retail store\nHe may decide from time to time that he's a boy and he may decide from time to time that he's a girl the complaint was filed in may with the help of the alliance defending freedom which

and calls himself a woman and says he identifies as a woman is free to use the ladies' room and the target stores as I said at best\nThat situation if everyone behaves themselves is at best uncomfortable for some people\nBecause you can imagine what a mother is going shopping at target takes her little daughter into the ladies' room and see someone who is clearly not a lady who's a man and it's using the restroom that's going to be an uncomfortable situation\nAt worst it may provide an opportunity for people who are up to no good to use that kind of access to sexually access\nOr to molest or at at at very least to harass\nLittle girls and that's wrong\nNow from the email files today by the way the email address is talk of Lars Larson dot com pat pond says Lars turnabout fair play\nIs there any way the Democrats can be investigated with the same gusto\nThat they're having judge Kavanaugh investigative better would change their tune real quick there is plenty that they are being investigated for right now including Dianne Feinstein and I think totally illegitimate decision to hold back information from that Senate Judiciary committee for months\nUntil she finally dropped at at the last minute that was the accusation by Christine forward against Brett Kavanaugh\nDianne Feinstein knew about it she kept it close to the vest she agreed that she was going to allow

go to Capitol Hill\nThey're going to take a look at a tomorrow Mitch McConnell already says there will be a vote on friday or Saturday about the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh and where does that leave our friends and the Democratic party\nWell it leaves them kind of grasping at straws there are saying well some of us had read the other six background checks done on judge Brett Kavanaugh all of which clear to him for the high level government job jihad and places like the White House and on the federal court of appeals\nGlad to take your phone calls and your emails that eight six six eight largest that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk at Lars Larson dot com by the way\nA we know that tonight the FBI further background review of Brett Kavanaugh on Christine Ford has now been delivered to the White House a copy of that is going to go to Capitol Hill\nThey're going to take a look at it tomorrow Mitch McConnell already says there will be a vote on friday or Saturday about the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh and where does that leave our friends in the Democratic party\nWell it leaves them kind of grasping at straws they're out saying well some of us have read the other six background checks done on judge Brett Kavanaugh all of which cleared him for the high level of government jobs he had to places like the White House and on the federal court of appeals one of the most sensitive positions in America\nAnd there there are combing through those things seeing if they can find some other kind of dirt that they can swing a judge Kavanaugh and I think the Democrats realized there quickly being made to look like fools they don't have anything to depend on now\nWell they're saying that previous background checks may show inappropriate behavior they will smear this man no matter what you know this is one of those situations where\nThey bit into a situation and they didn't know exactly what what what they were going to get and then once they got was they had hoped they would scare Brett Kavanaugh into withdrawing his own name or Donald Trump into withdrawing his name for him and they didn't get that so they had to stick with it they say we know is there as I told you\nTo some extent they seem like that young boy who always wanted his former dad to give him a pony\nAnd on a couple of nights before Christmas Eve the farmer has a big pile of my newer delivered to the front driveway of the farm\nAnd on Christmas morning the farmer walks out and he sees a little boy on top of the manure pile and he's got a shovel and his hand he's digging with all his might\nAnd when his dad says what are you doing out there he says that I Know there's a pony in here somewhere you know the Democrats haven't found the pony yet but there are going to try no matter what it costs them\nTo do ... do we have the two PM everything you need to know about finance and real estate for information\nMy path of income ... dot

three to four pm right here depend attack\nEleven hundred the next [noise]\n\nWelcome back to the Lars Larson show still tracking the latest events in foreign South Carolina where we understand\nThat a man is in custody who is apparently killed one cop and the wounded at least for others will get you details as they're available but this has now happened sometime ago about an hour ago that we got word he was in custody and CNN of course is calling him a shooter\nAnd not a killer but it appears that he is a cop killer and perhaps well we can just say a prayer for the other police officers were wounded in that I mentioned\nA moment ago uh the emergency\nPresidential alert system was tested today and I got that message and it kind of reminded me that uh uh about a year ago I was on a flight to Washington DC and with my producer\nAnd we're on a regular commercial flight we're sitting back and coach where we usually are and uh and I we we were sitting there on the runway and the pilots said we've got a ground stop we can't move the plane to the gate and unload all you folks because we've got a thunderstorm going on\nAnd right before all the rain and the wind and the lightning and thunder rolled over the top of that plane\nI saw something I'd never seen before you know usually when you land in a plane people pull out their cell phone and they call the person who's going to pick 'em up the air for the call their sweetheart like I Do and tell Tina that I'm safely on the ground every single phone\nIn that plane lit up at the same instance lit up and began ringing all at the same time we all ... looked at each other and laugh it was a thunderstorm alert\nThat's the kind of thing you get routinely in different places now we have the ability of the president of the United states to send a message to the whole country but I wanted to know what our tech expert Brian Westbrook thought about that Brian welcome back to the program\nFor a large and if it sounds a little bit louder I'm walking out of the conference we had here in Seattle, Washington I was just to require sell it and there was about a thousand of us are gathered in the room\nThe top of that plane I saw something I'd never seen before you know usually when you land in a plane people pull out their cell phone and they call the person who's going to pick 'em up the air for the call their sweetheart like I Do and tell Tina that I'm safely on the ground every single phone\nIn that plane lit up at the same instance lit up and began ringing all the same time we all ... to each other and laugh it was a thunderstorm alert\nAnd that's the kind of thing you get routinely in different places now we have the ability of the president of the United states to send a message to the whole country but I wanted to know what our tech expert Brian was burned thought about that Brian welcome back to the program\nCalled ... and if it sounds a little bit louder I'm walking out of a tech conference we had here in Seattle, Washington I was at the gate choir summit and there was about a thousand of us gathered in the room\nAnd at eleven eight teams Pacific time when the alert came through we were watching that alert of light up everyone's phone that we had everyone's stand up it would kind of a fun little moment into it\nWas an interesting experiment it was a great use of technology was\nKind of we we're not sure how would play out would it be on time with everybody receive I'm at the same time and for the most part you just heard sample set up about a thousand and you can watch the video on my Twitter feed a rap Brian Westbrook you it was really funny just to watch everybody stand up and within about a minute I Would say uh everyone received the alert\nA and it looked like most everyone in the room received it we didn't see a whole lot of people that didn't I think some people were buried in their work or checking their email and not paying attention to us on stage but other than that everybody seemed to receive the alert\nAnd seemed to receive in this case not very important information it was just a a test message no action required a and then I made a joke earlier today I said please now everybody let's not hit reply all I Would just be of course\nNot only can you not reply to this message which I think some folks would would love to be able to reply to all of a presidential text message but you also cannot unsubscribe unlike the thunderstorm warning that you talked about you can opt out of those you can also opt out of amber alerts you\nCannot however and and I think rightly so opt out of presidents alerts there is a threshold you're not going to be hearing political messages they tell us these are for extreme cases a major natural disasters nuclear attack that sort of thing hopefully we never receive another one of these\nBut that system is in place and it seems like any way it worked for the most part I've been tracking a couple of isolated incidents where\nPhones stopped working for some period of time uh obviously those can be some bugs and the software is going to need to improve but generally speaking it sounds like everything was except\nAs long as you're in the modern era now Brian\nI did get an email from a guy who's a regular emailer I got about nine hundred thousand emails a day and this man emails from time to time I recognize who handle and he wrote to me and said\nIt I didn't get the message but all my co workers and I said is sir you have an older phone don't you and he may have been one of those guys\nLike my father in law was until recently who stuck with who's tried and true flip phone and he wasn't going to give it up and I my father in law\nFinally gave it up and he seems to be enjoying it uh it but this guy said then I said well you just need to get a new phone how old do you have any idea how old the phone would have to be that it wouldn't get that message\nAnd actually doesn't have to be that old I\nThink I think and I'm I'm just making this up but I have in my head that it's about five years old if you have a phone that that old\nYou may not be able to receive these messages because of course the software has to be built into the phone but if you have an Android or an Iowa phone of really any generation like any recent generation if it's currently supported you'll definitely have access to this feature\nAnd I said this or you have an older phone don't you and he may have been one of those guys like my father in law was until recently who stuck with who's tried and true flip phone and he wasn't going to give it on and on my father in law\nFinally gave it up and he seems to be enjoying it uh it but this guy said that and I said well you just need to get a new phone how old do you have any idea how old the phone would have to be that it wouldn't get that message\nAnd actually doesn't have to be that old I think I think and I'm I'm just making this up but I have in my head that it's about five years old if you have a phone that that old\nYou may not be able to receive these messages because of course the software has to be built into the phone but if you have an Android or an Iowa phone of really any generation like any recent generation if it's currently supported you'll definitely have access to this feature\nA so you're talking about folks that don't have smartphones or have phones that are so old they are not being supportive and they're not being updated since this technology was rolled out a number of years ago\nAnd I also want to say that in some states you can be in areas where you just won't receive a signal or the ... there were a lot of folks joking earlier on social media today that if you put your phone in airplane mode well then you won't received a message either so\nThere are different cases where you wouldn't received a message but I gotta say if I'm near anyone at all unless I have my head in the sand or I'm Out on a remote island\nI Will hear about this weather it's not for myself it's from the Ninety percent or Ninety five or Ninety nine percent of the people in the room that do get the\nAlert hopefully one of them will tell me to take cover up necessary\nHey let me ask you about something you know we're doing to the point when when there was why was first available a lot of hotels always charge for these days why fight is becoming like color t._v. and electric lights every every hotel is giving at least some level of service airplanes are on their way to doing that in fact\nThere's a new a new satellite system that I understand it's going to grow up seven or eight hundred satellites are going to get launched where they say that stuff's going to go right to airplanes and at some\nPoint probably airplane why will become at least at the basic level will be a a regular part of the service if we had been hooked up to air airplane why fi I use that occasionally to work while I'm flying from coast to coast would I've got the signal then\nI Believe so and it was ... I actually talked to a friend of mine who's a flight attendant for one of the major carriers and he said he learned today and and he said I was surprised to learn you weren't really surprised that over half the plane had not with their phones in airplane mode and I went on their back during the flight I don't\nI don't know for sure if he was connected to why if I if they were on the ground or or or low enough that they were able to pick up and say no but\nI thought that was kinda funny little anecdote out about these emergency alerts as we know which ones have you have your phone on silent and still receive the alert I imagine that was a little bit of chaos on the airplane\nThey let me ask you this ... there was a big alert about Facebook and cybersecurity is this what should people do about this\nWell though there's been some advice floating around and I I've actually subscribe to this for some time that you should not use Facebook\nTo sign into other websites and here's why because you're putting all of your eggs in Facebook's basket if you will you're trusting them to rent to keep your information safe and to keep your sign in and your long and secure\nAnd unfortunately they've shown us recently that they may not be the best equipped to do that or they may not be doing as good as the job of keeping your information secure ah with with some ... million accounts being compromised we don't know if they have access to these third party sites when you use Facebook to sign into another site\nAnd that's actually even more troubling in my opinion than than them being able to say yes you are compromised the fact that they just don't know he's a little scary so my advice would be this using email to sign up creating unique password for every site and if he said to me ... and I know you're going to\nVice floating around and I I've actually subscribe to this for some time that you should not use Facebook to sign it to other Web sites and here's why because you're putting all your eggs in Facebook's basket if you will you're trusting them to rent to keep your information safe and to keep your sign in and you're lugging secure\nAnd unfortunately they've shown us recently that they may not be the best equipped to do that or they may not be doing as good of a job of keeping your information secure ah with with some ... million accounts being compromised we don't know if they have access to the third party sites when he used Facebook to sign into another site\nAnd that's actually even more troubling in my opinion than than them being able to say yes you were compromised the fact that they just don't know it's a little scary so my advice would be this using email to sign up creating unique password for every site and if you say to me ... and I know you're going to well that's a pain I Can't\nI don't know I use I use different logging names and and and I do use for everything I Try and make\nAll andme unique and you should and if you do if you're not as diligent as lawyers or myself what you do what you sign up for one of these password\nManager is like one pass or even use your operating system to do it for you take the heavy lifting off you but if you're not using unique username and password for everything\nInstead of Donald Trump being re elected in twenty twenty their chances of introducing articles of impeachment in the house of representatives and getting enough support to pass it and then taking it to the Senate for the trial which is what happened with Clinton he was in college\nHe was you know and then there was a trial and he was not convicted the idea of removing him whatever they found\nIf he were confirmed and then at some point next year or something comes up and we say wow the guy really was a bad guy it would have to be something so bad that you would get well until\nUntil the until and unless the Democrats have a majority in both the house and the Senate is not going to happen period and even if they did get a majority\nIn both house and Senate the idea that you get enough Democrats who would say whatever it is that he is said to have done ten or twenty or thirty or almost forty years ago is bad enough that we should remove him extremely unlikely\nVery very unlikely that answer your question\nWell it does um but my main concern is um you know all this came up what one week before his final confirmation you know\nDidn't it came up in July and then a democratic senator by the name of Feinstein or as the president culture Feinstein or decided to sit on the information and I think that was\nUntil and unless the Democrats have a majority in both the house and the Senate is not going to happen period and even if they did get a majority in both house and Senate the idea that you get enough Democrats who would say whatever it is that he is said to have done\nTen or twenty or thirty or almost forty years ago is bad enough that we should remove him\nExtremely unlikely very very unlikely that answer your question\nBut it does um but my main concern is um you know all this came up what one of the week before his final confirmation you know it didn't\nIt came up in July and then a democratic senator by the name of Feinstein or as the president culture Feinstein\nOr decided to sit on the information and I think that was a calculated move because she thought if I bring this up in July\nWe would they would have routinely asked him about it behind closed doors and said did you ever sexually assault this woman she says you did and he would have said no and that might have been the end of it at that point the Democrats could have decided to go for the Hail Mary pass and say we're going to\nAsk him about it in public under oath and they could have asked them again they could have had it investigated just as the FBI's looked into additional facts over the last few days and the same result would have happened and instead\nThey thought and I'm telling you I I can ... I Would bet money that this is what they did this is what Feinstein did she said I'm going to hold this information I'm gonna wait as she did until all of the hearings are over our opportunities to officially ask him about it and\nHave all been gone by and we're about to vote they were within days of the vote and then I'm going to drop this bomb and what they've become accustomed to is this kind of guerilla warfare this blitzkrieg approach where you say if we drop a big enough\nNasty in a sex bomb\nOn Brett Kavanaugh either he will decide to withdraw his own name saying I don't want to drag my family and myself through that or the president will look at it and say wow I'm not going to stand up\nFor that I Know this is going to be a rough go so the president withdraws his name or Kavanaugh was draws his name it was basically a giant bluff\nLike playing poker you you you don't have any cards in your hand you shut your whole pile of chips into the middle and you hope that everybody else at the table says wow you know Kyle must have a a one heck of a hand he's gotta he's got a royal flush\nOr he's got something special in that hand and they all cave in what they didn't count on\nIs that we have a different America today at least for some people we have a president with a backbone who doesn't take Bernie Sanders lightly and we have\nPeople like judge Kavanaugh who do not take this stuff and just immediately cave in now you and I both now there are plenty of Democrats who have easily and there are plenty of rhino Republicans who have easily\nThey were counting on a cave in so that they never have to actually prove\nThat they had a hand that they had a you know\nThe four of a kind or something and it didn't work and now they don't know what to do and they're trying to ... they're trying to salvage this\nLike just to clarify Ford actually came out with us ally and the Democrats well\nNot came out with ... anonymously made the complained to her rap ... member of Congress who brought it to Feinstein and then they sat on it they did not ask you\nWhat tiny July, July yeah okay that's that's life I also do it you know\nCave in now you and I both know there are plenty of Democrats who cave easily and there are plenty of rhino Republicans bouquet Beasley they were counting on a cave in so that they never have to actually prove that they had a hand that they had a you know\nThe four of a kind or something and it didn't work and now they don't know what to do and they're trying to ... they're trying to salvage this\nLike just to clarify hoard actually came out with this or why when the Democrats will\nNot team out where they actually anonymously made the complaint to her rap or member of Congress who brought it to Feinstein and then they sat on it they did not ask you\nWhat\nTiny July, July yeah\nOkay that's that's life I'll show you know what I mean they sat on it and didn't do anything about it\nThat's the problem it is it's real politic and it and say why not only in say Israel or\nEven with it as soon as I\nWrite and imagine this but if what you let's say your daughter's someday is about to marry some ... where you don't want the marriage to happen but you're heading right for that wedding day and you think there is nothing I can do I know a day or two before the wedding I'm going to sit my son my daughter down and say look\nYou're intended husband is a dirty dog and here's the information and you're hoping she won't look at it too hard\nAnd you're hoping she'll just call up say I'm not marrying you the wedding is off boom and blow the whole thing up now\nIf you give her that information three months out from the wedding and she says that this isn't true all sit down and talk to him about it and the man sits down says look I can I can show you that\nThis didn't happen what your dad is accusing you could imagine now what would you say about a person who would try to use that kind of bomb to blow up a

appreciate that\nYou know we've got Jennifer with us my poems this morning using rare form at all times right Jennifer you've got a dance and okay we're we're really excited to have discussion this morning the hearing about all alive before we go there I'd like to share with the audience a little bit about your background and you know you got involved in the field of nutrition\nReally busy lives you know for us as well as everybody else so it's easy to get addicted to snack foods but what happens is these carbohydrates or sugar extra carbohydrates in these snacks as well as a lot of milk products pizzas and ice cream they\nUse up the B. complex and the complex is essential friends any of your vitamins you die without them and this is the metabolites are behind all the functions of the body from brain\nTo a lemon nation so um that's what happens and it's very Integra critical to produce high ...\nSo the beautiful thing is when you start on our life whether it be the flavors which are twenty percent fruit you very delicious as Jennifer mentioned um they're real fruit juice extracts so it just makes drinking hon bitter delightful\nI call him our desert aloe and I start stimulating these wonderful hydro cork assets so you can digest not only protein better so you have the energy and you start building better cells and immunity but\nAlso minerals and as you know and if you don't know yet friends healthy magnesium and all the hundred trace minerals that's what keeps you out of disease you need to have these uh over Ninety One nutrients for the body to function\nWhich is like one big machine that runs on food and then you have to digested and absorb it and then the beautiful thing is you start making your own\nHide your core casket and you don't need to take as much to stay out of crises and um health that's really falling apart so\nTrack so it just makes drinking hon bitter delightful\nI call them our desert aloe and start stimulating these wonderful hydro clerk assets so you can digest not only protein better so you have the energy and you start building better cells and immunity but\nAlso minerals and as you know and if you don't know yet friends healthy magnesium and all the hundred trace minerals that's what keeps you out of the seeds you need to have these uh over Ninety One nutrients for the body to function\nWhich is like one big machine that runs on food and then you have to digested in absorb it and then the beautiful thing is you start making your own\nHydro core casket and you don't need to take much to stay out of crises and um health that's really falling apart so\nNot everybody has you know a heartburn and\nI'd be us bloating and consultation end or fast transit the area they don't always have the symptoms you know they they just have um [noise] their their health is dwindling so if you're not feeling your best and you're having you know one diagnoses after another it's a fun\nUnimportant product to start on aloe life and you can just start with capsules if you're on medication it's not ... indicated\nBut it helps medication or food work better that's the only downfall is that it does help the absorption\nOf not only our food and supplements but also when he drugs so you just start with last and then as you need to lower your medication you make that decision with your pharmacist stand or your doctor\nBut if you win the the beautiful thing is these very expensive drugs and actually a very um depleting because ah Tufts Medical university says that we actually use up to court nutrients for every pharmaceutical drugs\nUm you're going to feel better in the long run as you start building up your health\nCare and do all hello products were the same or its aloe life that much better\nI'm so glad you asked that Jennifer because I get excited and working with you all and we haven't talked in a while but there is a big difference in our products\nAnd it is the number one category of all super foods and um herbs today so aloe is important and some people when they get a little bit results like they don't feel quite as bloated they feel a little bit of energy they stick on a low quality product\nBut when you go with the whole leave to concentrate the solids which measure all the actors are much greater three to four to even a hundred times greater than some other products\nAnd unfortunately Jennifer some products have know aloe excuse me know aloe left in them at all\nThey'd been watered down to the point where you can't even get and pick up any of the active so there's unfortunately a lot of adult to ration going on in this industry and we are trying we are members of the world organization the international aloe science council\nAnd we're really trying to you know reduced the incidence of adult trainers\nThe ... yeah and I'm so glad that you don't dilute it it did seem to concentrate and I always explain to other people who grab the diluted form\nI said look at how many um you're serving are going to get in this big huge gallon and they're holding a gallon and they're looking at the Serbian ... you know quantity and it's only since fourteen\nI said okay what does that tell you there you didn't watered down\nSo then I go ahead and reach for our life and explained the ... the good flavors in there and that you only need a capsule to start off with you\nSo right it's the best buy and it's concentrated there's twenty five pounds of aloe leaves\nHistory and we are trying we are members of the world organization the international aloe science council and we're really trying to you know reduced the incidence of adult trainers\nThe ... yeah and I'm so glad that you don't diluted you did see the concentrate and I always explain to other people who grab the diluted form\nI said look at how many um you're serving are going to get in this big huge gallon and they're holding a gallon and they're looking at the Serbian ... you know quantity and it's only since fourteen\nI said okay what does that tell you there you didn't watered down\nSo then I go ahead and reach for our life and explain the ... the good flavors in there and that you only need a capsule just start off with\nYou are so right it's the death by and it's concentrated there's twenty five pounds of aloe leaves in every court so that way you can take helpful if you're on a budget like I Am and then go to the uh out per day but\nBecause it's hon better to get all the value of that I'm Talking about even getting into helping your skin re new and allergies reverse because you're building more college and not only do you look better but you step out on the itchy eyes and the throat and the charges on him that Paul ones but you know taking one to two ounces is\nAmazing it starts the detoxification of liver it helps to chant we moved the bowels or help with\nA high inflammation sometimes people have the fast chance it so they start with less and then they can slowly um increase because there's this the cream of the crop it's cream on the top I should say\nIt him five natural anti inflammatory in the plant so because aloe life does not over filter not only do take less and get more\nBut you have these extra added benefits of lowering inflammation in the guts as well as in the joints\nMany people feel better they don't have the same arthritic or symptoms and it\nThat's what helps initially in the allergy reduction and that allows the body to heal it's a wonderful thing uh you know we know inflammation is too high it's a great partner with any fish oil or flags oil to help those essential oils get absorbed\nAnd get the inflammation down I Love the twelve also and B. complex as we mentioned earlier as partners to get the inflammation down friends and even a nice screens product we make a fabulous screens I don't know if you carry it yet but it's wonderful to get inflammation down in nutrition up in the body\nWill we also have one of the products um that I wanted to tell the listeners a little bit more about two if we have some time here if you can quickly tell us I'm hearing about the detox plus formula\nYes um unfortunately many people don't get excited about nutrition or understand how important you know their actions and choices are but you need to eat you know vegetables and proteins and essential right\nWhich is pretty easy we even had some guidelines in the books and let literature that you have in the store from our life because we believe in health and nutrition but the aloe life help\nThe products your your food choices work okay so um the detox plus is for advanced\nOr conditions of the body that people just really need that extra cleansing and detoxification so because of the

buyers for putting them together they're negotiating I Do the deal and negotiate the deal on their behalf that one right now for about two hundred thousand coin I'm negotiating the deal\nGuy that way the the buyers don't have to get their put themselves out there so I you have to do your wife said and that way you that means no your customers have to know your customers or do are due diligence\nSo we know the customer with the salary we're doing our due diligence that way they don't have to put themselves out in the public\nAnd we're doing so I didn't go jade the deal when it comes down to given the coin and given the money it's all lawyers there the lawyers shake hands here sign this sign that OK dumped do ask grow do the deal just like real estate\nI'm telling you that it [laughter] just like real estate so anyway the or I or rats is regulated it for real estate so if you're looking to buy it another piece of property by half cash have bitcoin or\nExcept the bitcoin\nLet's say if you got a couple of ... okay let's say you got a couple of hundred thousand or a couple of million profit in your property that you're going to make whatever it is\nMaybe it's only forty fifty whatever it is thousand extra profit how about taking half ... going to take a risk because its profit the calculated risk I I was talking to somebody this morning I'd rather err\nOn the side of being wrong\nThen err on the side of stupid\nBecause bitcoin is not going away most people don't know about it it's brand new out there anyway I'm just talking now not getting any facts or anything just talking okay because it's not going away it's here to states the money the future\nWhatever it is maybe it's only forty fifty whatever it is thousand extra profit how about taking half ... going take a risk because its profit the calculated risk\nI I was talking to somebody this morning I'd rather err on the side of being wrong then err on the side of stupid\nBecause bitcoins not going away most people don't know about it it's brand new out there anyway I'm just talking now not getting any facts or anything just talking okay the bitcoins not going away it's here to stay in the money that future now\nHow to\nClose on property using the block chain and not use that's why it's called disrupt that's why the block chain is called disruptive\nBecause it's going to literally just like going into the guard and taking your little pick your shovel and turning the dirt over his disruptive is going to just turn some of these industries upside down that's why I say all ... out and brothers coming on next\nWrecking day I'm going to try to get one of them in the studio the last segment here the Elton brothers you want to listen to that show the real estate guys here in town and they have a show here you should listen to the show that the eleven o'clock hour on Thursday so anyway today so imagine having one Tara ... full of money\nSo here's how it works ... inflation major print more more out there the ... ...\n... there is no printing all the money you don't need more there's Twenty one million bitcoins ever going to be made it's enough money for the world to ever have K now with that said\nYou can take the bitcoin and you can fraction of damn one bitcoin equals one get this one point two five eight to ... terabytes which is pretty incredible and because you don't have to print more it deep flights\nNow in twenty twenty this is why if you're not a formal\nRight now in order to follow is go look it up ... [laughter]\nA\nFear of missing out from a if you're not a bummer right now imagine having a billion the value of a billion\nLike my new friend I met yesterday or the value of a hundred billion imagine having the value of a terabytes and cash my dog over ... ... what do you think he just Norway no he's not paying attention to me at all [laughter]\n[noise] oh well thank you wants to gamble ice cream church for being so kind to me and my boy compound you made me made me made me feel good yeah\nTwenty twenty this is why if you're not a formal right now in order to do is go look it up ... [laughter]\nA fear of missing out find out if you're not a bummer right now imagine having a billion the value of a billion like my new friend I met yesterday or the\nValue of a hundred billion imagine having the value of a terabytes and cash my dog over ... ... what do you think he just Norway no he's not paying attention to me at all [laughter]\n[noise] oh well thank you once again life's dream church for being so kind to me\nAnd my boy compound you made me made me made me feel good yeah a church is known by the people that represented and you represent yourself well okay so\nThe imagine having that sort of deflation area which made the bitcoin is a house of value or a store a value it becomes more valuable now twenty twenty\nThe bitcoin is going to do in order to mine it on the block chain it's going to have like taking a an apple\nI like pizza so let's talk about ... just cut a peach and half you got to have\n... now it's not like the stock market where you have\nA security like Amazon split or apple that split Amazon hasn't split but apple that split that split it's not like that what it means on the line is and this is why it's so valuable when you split on the in the securities you got two of them\nIt's inflationary when that happens here because it's digital\nWhen you have it that means you get fraction damn it doesn't inflate it be flights and when it deflated becomes more valuable to hold onto All right now with that said\nIn twenty twenty bitcoin is going to have and when they have it's good I mean it's going to be fifty percent more difficult to mind which means is going to be more valuable to hold onto\nJust something to think about you can leave a legacy\nI'm seriously you could leave a legacy is going to be the biggest shift in well in human history odd enough about that bitcoin let's look at it sixty five forty nine and then there's green all over the charts oh by the white\nYesterday during when they do the guy said hey debate

showing it up all day with this ten year moving all over the place that people will kinda figured it out what's going on what their next steps are\nOh absolutely well fortunately for me on my we're already locked in\nThe that they can evolve and Dan has that crystal ball [laughter]\n[noise] well it is what the market and so my belief is is the aim at work where you lock it move on because it's going to grow up a lot quicker than it is going to come down because there are no indication that it's gonna come down\nThat's a good way to put it if the payment works for you lock it in because you know there are people out there that are like oh I I don't want to lock in over\n... yeah they're they're they're struggling over an eighth and then you know the next day we have a day like today where rates are up a half probably or a quarter or whatever grazing numbered\nThat exactly I'm telling you it's the water cooler affect\nIt is psychologically psychologically people do not want to pay a certain rate because they believe that they have to somehow let people know they paid a certain rate I don't get it if the payment works locking in in an environment where rates are going to probably go continue to rise\nRight that Hitler they did this ten year they're talking about to go into what three three and three quarters\nOr I don't know what it goes through but that will be ... I Will say this Powell the fed chief basically said the economy is working on all cylinders there is no reason to have accommodate of\nUh he used the word accommodate of rates as in he's basically saying he's going to these telegraphing a rate increase in December\nSo I mean look in the past they they've increased rates and nothing really happened the ten year kinda jostle between two and a half and three or two point seven five and three and for a long time we hit three several times and it fell back now we've actually kind of broken through so who knows what the new high is going to be\nAnd I do believe people will come off the fence and and lock in and start buying just fear based\nNot wanting to pay higher then where it is now I mean typically what happens people rush in [noise]\nWell I don't know we we've also seen a lot of people wait for the pull back and they've gotten it my point exactly they they wait for the pull back but now they don't get it right but but the last five years they've gotten it they've gotten to pull back uh it got tenure got up\nRates got up to come back down rates go up come back down um and and I I I agree with you now I don't think they're going to get\nThem think they're going to get that really I don't think they're going to get that a pull back this time\nIt's that coupled with the shortage and now of housing um I think we're going to continue to see a trend\nWhile we got we got this uh seven peach drum roll getting ready to to see what rates are the enemy right where\nTo go to write to the second I just I Want to get into this because this is very important we we've been talking for the last couple of months about the down payment assistant the pathway to purchase program it has a limited shelf life and I just thought we could\nFor the pull back but now they don't get it\nRight but but the last five years they've gotten it they've gotten to pull back uh it got tenure got up and reach got up to come back down rates go up come back down um and and I I I agree with you now I don't think they're going to get them think they're going to get that really I don't think they're going to get that a pull back\nThis time it's back a couple of witness shortage and now\nOf housing um I think we're going to continue to see a trend well we got we got this uh Seventy drummer all getting ready to to see what rates are and I mean when I Want to go to ... to the second I just I Want to get into this because this is very important\nWe we've been talking for the last couple of months about the down payment assistant the pathway to purchase program it has a limited shelf life and I just thought we could go over that again the end if we could do to let people know I Know it's it's it's basically it's Fifteen million dollars one point five million a month for ten months\nRight talk about it back\nAnd it could just go a little bit longer if they don't use it all up that people really like that program and they qualify for it because you figure it ... percent up to twenty thousand dollars and you only have to occupy the property for five years and then it's totally forgiven\nSo that ten percent that sorry yeah hundred recap that ten percent if you stay in the property five years you do not have to pay it back\nRight and you can't refinance out of it either so yeah you know people find that very palatable\nEspecially in this day and age where they're paying such high amounts for rent it very difficult for a lot of home buyers to save and so they're liking the program it is only certain ZIP Code but there are up and coming neighborhoods\nAnd a lot of people are willing to take that chance so to give you an idea as of yesterday October funds were already exhausted\nSo you want if you want to take advantage of this program you wanna get in you want to get under contract you want to get locked in because it is on a first come first served basis and you know the people that were on that program\nThat maybe this cell is not going to give them an extension probably have to flip to a different program you know like the home was through the home and five which is a lot less money down and it has different parameters\nThis is backed by Maricopa County or who's backing this is the bond by\nYes it is true the county and um you know it covers it's it's actually through the state because it covers more than just Maricopa County okay it covers um Tucson\nI'm now in county [noise] you have a party so these different counties that I've covered so as you know some of those areas or even harder hit and people make less money in a lot of the outer lying areas so when you're dealing with an entire state it goes fairly quickly\nNow you said something interesting we are here we are it's October forced were four days into this month and the funds for October have already been used up\nYes so you have to get in some go ahead my assumption is people that\nA lot of them that we're supposed to close in September had to move their clothes that's grown up to October\nOr they locked them in September or ... you know or they lock them waited till October first to lock them to close at the end of October so it's like it's just it's a waiting game so if you want to get in\nAreas or even harder hit and people make less money in a lot of the outer lying areas so when you're dealing with an entire state it goes fairly quickly\nNow you said something interesting we are here we are it's October forced were four days into this month and the funds for October I've already been used up\nYes\nSo you have to get\nSome go ahead my assumption is people that\nProbably a lot of them that we're supposed to close in September had to move their clothes that's grown up to October\nOr they locked him in September or you know or they locked them waited till October first to lock them to close at the end of October so it's like it's just it's a waiting game\nSo if you want to get in on the program my suggestion would be that you get in get pre qualified and get out there and find yourself a property find out where we're at with the friends know when to pull the trigger on the walk\nAnd go from there to insecure that fun\nIf you guys have questions about this and about structuring it about the timing of it give deanna call six to six so six sixty seven twenty eight six to six so six\nSixty seven twenty eight that's the pathway to purchase ten percent down assisted down payment program uh how about the rates on that I I Know that regular rates have gone higher would that have affected this program as well\nYes uh yesterday believe it or not the ... even the bond programs including the pathway to purchase a midday rate change\nSo that's highly unusual will still you know rates are going up it started out I looked at it yesterday I Believe that the beginning of the day it was five planes seven five and then after the raid change I Believe that went six or how ... you know the market was really off yesterday so\nA lot of our investor well all of our investors actually read price midday wow\nWell we're looking at it here um why do we get into rates you're the good news um\n[laughter] after ha VA government programs where are we today yeah not water cooler Iraq no boy case though the lady\nWe're at five percent on an F ha with an aid or if

one of my favorites you're going to know what it is oh okay so\nI'm here now they say because now that it should never Ramirez was in her ... interviewed by the FBI right they haven't said anything about Ramirez\nAnd I loved it how Jennifer Rubin to pretend conservative at the Washington Post the only reason Jennifer Rubin calls herself a conservative as because they have\nA bunch of of old angry progressive women already\nAnd that that's an over saturated marketplace do it what is it is if you claim that you're a Republican or conservative and you're back to administration well then there's some ... to be had there come on over there like me calling myself a football player her saying that she's a conservative columnist\nDenier so harsh this morning to sit down and have a cookie were economical you ... would be yeah I Know more about football machine hosted by conservatism oh my God and that's just not a lot\nSo she had asked serious question doesn't Deborah Ramirez tell blah blah blah blah blah yeah they they they interviewed her\nGood job keeping up on the fact wants you to write a column about it but no one will read except to fish about good job keeping up with the facts\nThey interviewed her you know they interviewed mark judge for eleven thousand hours I don't remember how long it was like ours though that they interviewed him nothing there\nThis was a it said they they made the talking point that they have\nIs that while you know they didn't talk to the some of these people there are you know I Can't believe that there'll be out and talk to some of these people wait a minute I'm Sorry you mean the people\nThat you told just like a year like a year ago or a couple of months ago after the guy's name came up that oh well I think he did something to me those people who heard it thirty six years later and they heard it secondhand you think that that the corroborating witness\nPre cell or sell high\nLike Democrats sometimes think that the FBI will be Keystone Cops for them\nNow all of a sudden they're not happy with the FBI you remember that organization that it was essentially a spin to criticize just a couple of weeks ago Cain actually just a week ago do you remember them all sitting there like gets these on that panel\nStart critical reference y'all remember them sitting on that panel and they were saying oh my gosh we must\nHave the FBI ... it is a ... steamboat him set the FBI investigate this\nI mean ... shouldn't how all of these I mean accusations we must rather do that\nBy in stealing the authority of investigation into the FBI because they will get to the bottom of this Oh yes and then they all nervous amongst themselves Oh yes that's absolutely we must have them that\nChat and Grassley we shot into the vote on on this individual and here we have Sarah\nInvestigation by the FBI and that\nSo we could go do you remember them all sitting there like gets these on that panel\nDark critical reference you all remember them sit on that panel and they were saying oh my gosh we love to have\nThe FBI that to get it is the most simple ... set the FBI investigate this\nI mean since you a shouldn't have all of these I mean accusations we must rather do that\nBy and stealing the authority of investigation into the FBI because they will get to the bottom of this Oh yes and then they all nervous amongst themselves Oh yes that's absolutely we must have them that\nChat and Grassley we shot into the vote on their own this individual and here we have Sarah\nInvestigation by the FBI and that\nThe FBI investigated\nAnd then they came back and said you have all good\nAnd now they're ... so I have a list\nOf who man you want to hear my list of who mad\nBooker mad Feinstein mad a Democrat mad now they're claiming their the

investigation\nMany of us have said that if judge Kavanaugh dead well he's been accused of doing by\nSome of the Democrats and outside\nSome outside people should be disqualified\nBut after an investigation for both the committee\nAnd the FBI\nWe have found nothing\nAbsolutely nothing to cooperate accusations against him\nAnd we need to confirm him right away\nHis confirmation will be a victory for the Senate as an institution\nOr reminder that the politics of baseless personal destruction\nHas no place here\nI think he's one of the best nominees I've seen in my forty two years in the United States Senate\nThat projects to him for the way he's been traded\nYes this is an important position yes and Democrats have a right to feel very worried and upset about about ... Republican getting this seat\nBecause they thought they had won the election\nBut that isn't the case\nIn our side is handled this I think with discretion\nHaving every problem that has come up and frankly I Hope we can just move forward and you get this done it's the right thing to do\nFor judge Kevin as a great judge\nCan make a great justice on the United States Supreme court and I intend to do everything I possibly can to make sure he gets there as quickly as we can [noise]\n\nHer friend the\nSenior senator from Minnesota\nSaid about this confirmation process she said this is not

it will be a vote for this shameful intimidation tactics\nThat have been employed as part of an orchestrated smear campaign\nFBI investigation of\nNow they've talked to a total of a hundred and fifty different people\nOr through the seven background investigations that judge Kavanaugh has been through since Nineteen Ninety three or ... operation\nNo confirmation of any of these outrageous accusations that have been made\nUnfortunately this could have all\nMost of the embarrassment to Dr Ford and and the public circus like atmosphere if we adjust the ranking member had just made the allegations known\nIn the regular process and could have been investigated as I said in a way that would have protected her and her confidentiality\nI've said before and I say it again I Believe that we should\nAnd we did treat Dr Ford the same way I Would want my daughters\nOr my mother treated under similar circumstances\nJudge Kavanaugh's entitled to a fair process to\nAnd he has not been subjected\nTo a fair process anything butts\nSo now's the time to quit\nAll of these antics these high jinx\nThe circus like atmosphere and will do that tomorrow morning when we both\nAnd Saturday when we vote to finally confirmed a this good man did this important position [noise]\n\nProcess of reviewing the FBI reports that we received this morning a has been exhausted and it has been a collaborative process with my colleagues a it occurred in a classified environment because these are documents that were not allowed to return to disclose to the public\nEye but because we can review them and only one place we review them together and we stopped and we talked about each point made to make sure that we understood or is the message from each interview in each report\nAlthough that part of it by operation of law is not allowed to be public I Want to give you this year I said we treated these documents just as we treated each and every allegation without most seriousness\nWith a desire to do nothing more than search for the truth\nAnd justice we've spent hours upon hours hearing testimony in an open a hearings before the public we've also spent hours upon hours reviewing these documents in a classified environments\nAllegations of sexual\nMisconduct are serious of sexual assault or of a most\nOpen a hearings before the public we've also spent hours upon hours reviewing these documents in a classified environments\nAllegations of sexual\nMisconduct are serious of sexual assault or of a most serious nature and always have to be treated with most seriousness may have been in this case\nAgain this is someone who's been through seven background investigations\nIn the course of the last three decades\nWith over a hundred and fifty people interview\nWith regard to this is a man of outstanding character who has lived an exemplary life he and his family had been subjected\nTo a lot of question a lot of embarrassment a lot of humiliation\nHas been a difficult part of this process for him\nBut in the process of doing that\nHe's proven his character and his willingness\nTo be candid with the public\nAnd ... even sharing facts that are at times so uncomfortable\nI'm convinced of this man's character of his true for most of his qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court or the United states I wholeheartedly support his confirmation and look forward to voting for him in the coming hours\nWell of agree with everything my colleagues have said I\nAlso want to say that Dr Ford I firmly believe experienced a traumatic event in her life I just also believe that there is no evidence that we've seen\nThrough the FBI background checks through the time that we've spent and they're hearing um just to stay in shape that these claims are properly

cabinet as we are as we start back up here let's talk about you got you got the corporate or you got to college education of the way you've got a job\nNow you're married you you've done the American thing\nWhen that what time did you start to think maybe this is it into\nA [noise] probably I'm very early on in my in the corporate jobs so I I work\nFor uh my my first knowledge of what was in high tech I worked for us and the conductor manufactured probably the only one out here in Dallas so everybody's got to know what I'm Talking about but that was my first normally jog coming out of college I was there for Eighteen years and I I think just going through that whole process of um\nOf of making a little bit of money and just kind of going through corporate America politics and the system than understanding what's possible you know I always felt like there was something more I was just spending just an incredible amount of time doing what I was doing and and traveling all the time and you know seven\nAM meetings to turn around seven PM meeting you know there's just no burning time at at both ends you know and trading a lot of that for four at the time was you know very little money and I think throughout the whole the whole process you know over the course of those Eighteen years\nI knew there had to be something different I I figured there had to be something of an easier way a better way of of just replacing my income of if I were going to retire\nYou know how am I going to replace that income that I'm not going to be making you know and high tech you know you're lucky to make it by fifty you know I'm\nFifty five sixty is is almost you know out of the question and so um it's not that I felt like my time with limited but I felt like I needed to figure this thing out whatever retired I was going to be and how I was going to make that happen\nAnd start early and and start early is what we always talk about what what what we're taught is that you know work and save them and we did that and we work than we saved quite a bit you know with with what we were bringing in [noise] and um\nYou know very little money and I think throughout the whole the whole process you know over the course of those Eighteen years\nI knew there had to be something different I I I figured there had to be something of an easier way a better way of of of just replacing my income of if I were going to retire\nYou know how am I going to replace that income that I'm not going to be making you know and high tech you know you're lucky to make it by fifty you know I'm\nFifty five sixty is is almost you know out of the question and so um it's not that I felt like my time was limited but I felt like I needed to figure this thing out whatever retirement what's going to be and how I was going to make that happen\nAnd start early and then start early is what we always talk about what's with what we're taught is that you know work and save them and we did that and we work than we saved quite a bit\nYou know with with what we were bringing in [noise] and um\nYou know it was I think always something out there that I just couldn't put my hands on and it wasn't until you know\nReally twenty Thirteen um that I that I discovered lifestyles on that and and that was only only because of the friend of mine you know we're walking and having to quit coffee break down the hallway we were talking about you know a real estate investments and things of that nature and he kind of turned me onto it but um you know\nBefore then it was the same thing that everybody else does you know it was four one K. was there is a bus stop was mutual funds that was the golden handcuffs and\nIf you're in corporate America out there you know exactly what I'm Talking about you know they latch on to you and puppies going handcuffs and when you called stock options and mendota can set back and keep it for four more years because they give you know so many shares that will will maybe or maybe you know be above water\nBut um you know at the end of it I was I was making really good like I had a really good we had a really good life I mean we were making six figures easy you know and uh what we thought was due to a job security you know without really knowing what was going to happen or when it was going to happen in terms of offer reward but um\nBut it wasn't until twenty Thirteen that we found a lot of sauce and decided to make that you know\n[noise] so let's talk about transition because you know you got to get good job working [noise] you know when you hear about this what was it the did enticed you wouldn't somewhat explained it to to just must be a friend or work or whatever uh what was it didn't tell you about this thought process\nAnd I think I realized yeah um I I think I realized\nPretty quick it was everything that I had been looking for you know the whole idea of real estate I've I've read if people you know a millionaire next door and then millionaire\nUm there was another one out there but I I read those books and stuff and knew that real estate was was something that that I thought makes sense I just didn't have the means to knowledge or the education to figure out how to do it without putting everything that we had saved at risk and so there was hesitation and the skepticism then\nAnd it was you know be talking about these five twenty nine plans for kids you know college savings and and and and their teacher education and you know my buddy was you know Carlos was telling me about you know investing in and\nSingle family you know properties than he has three kids as well we had a lot in common he bought three of them\nAnd his idea was I bought a house for each kid and when they're ready to go to college we're just going to sell the house take all the equity out and boom there's our college tuition I thought man most incredible thing I've ever heard how the heck did you figure out how to do this and uh he mentioned you mentioned lifestyle\nYou know and um you know we got into it you know through through that way you know through Helmand that that little five minute session\nYou know to me as you as you said your\nAccomplishes you are right now that that simple concept at all he wanted out of but worse you know so many of our members want to be completely retired so many more to be millionaires he just wanted a way to fund his kids college that's an amazing thought that it can be sent home was that yet empowering\nSinging and single family you know properties than he has three kids as well we had a lot on than a bought three of them and his idea was I bought a house for each kid\nAnd when they're ready to go to college we're just going to sell the house all the equity out and build their star college tuition I thought man most incredible thing I've ever heard of how the heck did you figure out how to do this and you mentioned you mentioned lifestyle you know and um\nYou know we got into it you know through through that way you know through Helmand that that little five minute session\nYou know to me as you said you're\nAs accomplished as you are right now that that simple concept at all he wanted out of but worse you know so many of our members want to be completely retired so many of them want to be millionaires he just wanted a way to fund this kid's college that's an amazing thought that it can be a shame all of that yet empowering you thought that was amazing\nAnd now with what you know from what all you've done you can realize that that was a very tiny step compared to what he could have done so it's it's interesting to hear the story from that perspective so how did you come to lifestyles originally did you go to a free workshop that you bring you to a case study how'd you how'd you get over here\nYeah his his membership civil as he he's he's been with us we're for quite some time two thousand not but he's only ... homes and I didn't know about the case studies or anything like that are really anything beyond that are are having a lot to do my research and found a free workshop and that was my\nThat was you know my my end into lifestyles that kind of you know see what this was about and whether or not we thought it made sense and we went through that a free workshop and and that progress into you know the two day\nAnd um I told my wife I said look it's um\nI think it was five hundred bucks or something like that at the time and are said look it's going to be the best I've hundred bucks we we've ever spent because this was going to completely change your life so we're not but it it it's a hundred bucks you know and so um\nWe made that small jumped in what it is I mean it was a I mean for for my buddies is by three single family homes for him that was pretty big you know for me it's a five minute conversation which has the potential completely change in my life did\nAnd then it's the next you know small little set that I had to take to make a a five hundred dollar investment just to figure out the nuts and bolts of this thing what it's about and you know and understanding a lot more this what I thought was going to be single family and you know real estate I only had no concept of multi family or apartments or anything of that nature\nBut it was just the course of these small steps that that we talk and these small decisions that we made and\nThat that really honestly got us to where we are now you know\n[noise] well you know when you look at this thing you look back\nYou probably sit there and go like it happened so quickly I don't even know how it happened I the older I get the faster time flies by and these days are thrown at me or not that far behind you they're not that long ago and I do the manual with three or four apartment complexes now many on right now\nAnd as the income goes up there's more to live on but I don't live on it because I'm already ... life's quality wise so mortgage investors and so the growth curve it just gets more like a hockey stick goes up faster and faster so I think that's something that\nI've never been really good at getting across to people you most people think hey I stopped working then now I gotta die before I run out of money is not even close to true and I can see what you you grow your portfolio continue to grow your portfolio\nFinance is probably not even on the table for you anymore you're probably at that point was that many deals that much either you under your belt that you just don't even worry about it um the other one is is that\nRetirement is not the end but it's really the beginning you think about what you're able to do right now Kevin with all the time you have to think about a new business to create a new business to go with your family do stuff\nLet's compare time wise because now before even if you want to do something and you were the brilliant engineer you couldn't do it you had to get up and go to work now something hit you in the middle of the night you get up tomorrow morning and you attack at like a dog talk about the time difference in being your own man\nI yet again it's it's a it's a night and day difference and that that\nReally is what it's about I mean and in corporate America and America you're you're trading all your time or for what seems like good money and and and that's what it is and you know I Would\nI'd be out the door before my girls even woke up before I could get them you know before they even ate breakfast you know had to work just to avoid the morning traffic you know what I mean and catch him to catch a seven AM call you know work my twelve fourteen sixteen hour days go back home you know most times you know not even be able to to\nSome you know before they go back to bed before I'm coming back into the door [noise] um you know catching better or not you know sometimes in some cases only to hop on another phone call at seven PM and [noise] and then that's the circle is is this just vicious corporate circle that just turns in grinds and\nAnd um it's it can be um\nI I don't know if people see people get used to that and uh\nIt's a it's a time the empire I mean I spent a lot of time traveling overseas traveling the world and when I was younger that was great got hit the world to see a lot of things but you know with my kids and everything I Want it to be home I wanted to\nSpend the weekends with them instead of being stuck in an airport you know I wanted to be able to wake up in the morning and and make the decision whether or not going to go to work you know do I have to go to that meeting and that really important and I put it off that's Maro do I need to do it now you know and\nI can do all that now yeah I'll give you a quick example we were we were going somewhere I forgot what we're go we're going out of town on a weekday and uh we're stuck on the freeway it's probably eight o'clock nine o'clock in the morning something like that\nAnd one of my girls goes who are all these people are going well he's talking about\nJust vicious corporate circle that just turns in grinds and and um it's it can be um\nI I don't know people keep people get used to that and uh\nIt's a it's a time to empire I mean I spent a lot of time traveling overseas traveling the world and when I was younger that was great to see the world got to see a lot of things but you

stuck in traffic this is morning traffic and they had no concept of morning traffic you know what I mean because they had never done that with you before you know like these people were going to work\nThis is what people do this is what most people do this is not what daddy does your daddy leave he goes to the properties that today open all that's gone and he comes back before that traffic hits against so they they didn't know the concepts of of morning traffic you know because they've they've never been exposed to it so [noise]\nYou know stuff like that I mean is it in terms of time it's it's been it's been a big change has been an amazing change or is it in one that I did really anticipate happening\nYou know and just from a retirement perspective you know my my plane was fifty five that's when I was gonna retire I had my spreadsheets engineer spreadsheets number as all that stuff calculated I beat my playing by fourteen years because of lifestyle\nWhile seniors I retired when I was forty one you got me be right thirty four [laughter] but I I was able to get out of their forty one you know personal choice no layoff know separates me writing a letter to my manager saying you know what guys\nI'm going home [laughter] you know what I mean and that's what it was it was making that decision of hey I don't need this job\nI don't need the job I don't need this any more I have the passive income I had my first beloved elite investor you know we had a plan in front of a sat down with my mentors at the time you know multiple times to say I am I crazy you know I I'm seriously thinking about doing this job a very very comfortable death due to\nInsurance the whole thing too I'm just going to throw it all the wage jobs because I Believe in the system because of this system in the last two years has done more for me than the last eight team\nAnd that's how significant that was for us in the end we made the job I mean war retired shortly after we join\nShe retired and late twenty Thirteen and then the plan was for me to get out and um I made that happen in June of ... shortly after closing our personal but it was because of that passive income\nThat got us to that opportunity that created that opportunity for us to make that kind of decision and that's a that's a big decision that wasn't very big decision but it's been it's it's like you said it's it's the funk really started after I retired you know what I mean I made more money after retiring than I ever did in the Eighteen years I was I was at that company\nYeah that's a really scary part is is to look that good I thought I was getting somewhere but heck was scratching service on the opportunity for making money that's that's a crazy or did you start out as a pastor Brazil lead on your

of expenditures that we were trying to replace them so through\nThat we tapped into multifamily you know and the two day you always talk about going with the end in mind and then we took that to heart it was like look we're in a place of the savings that we've been reporting up\nSo that's a that's a big decision that was a very big decision but it's been it it's like you said it really started after I retired you know what I mean I made more money after we already did I ever did in the Eighteen years I was I was a couple of them\nYeah that's a really scary part is is that if you look back and I thought I was getting somewhere but heck I Will change Gretchen service on the opportunity for making money that's that's crazy part did you start out as a pastor Brazil lead on your first

special\nIs that we have Mickey camera in here in the studio with us today from gateway mortgage group how you doing this morning Mickey attack that carry on doing excellent and you know I just wanted to let you know as the listener some of the topics of today are unusual as usual\nAnd disruptive to the financial sector and if you don't allow yourself to slow down and listen to this whole show these topics may become disruptive to your personal finances and families some of the topics we will be covering will be information that will change your life\nAnd secure your family's future\nSo anyway basically\nIn a in a nutshell\nYou know I have Mickey camera in here today and she has been so immersed with in the back end of financial matters in mortgage real estate everything that has to do with the most important purchase that you possibly can make within your life\nThis show is disruptive enough\nOkay but I can tell you right now when you have real individuals' and you know I I've been trying to get ... to tell you guys exactly how long she's been in the business and you know without you know wanting to date herself\nYou know I said over Thirty years [laughter] [laughter] well I have a few more years I came from one of the major\nBanking lenders I won't say names but I tell you what they were so many rules and regulations and overlay that I thought that's the way life was but ... years they're like dog years\nI'm like a hundred and sixty years old [laughter] I like good they think they asked us if you can't the listeners but I I'm not a I'm not worried about yeah for\nSure Mickey and so I'm just glad I really want to drive out home again you guys and you know I did mention you know kind of like how disruptive this can be because I Know which a lot of people get\nReally really really\nJust caught up with the pace of life through the holidays and the holidays coming in you know my favorite holiday is right around the corner\nAnd when we come into the holidays with the fed meeting two more times to raise interest rates well has taken place is that actually refinances have increased one point seven percent just within a month and when you\nIn fact the life that I Am not a I'm that way and yeah for sure Mickey and so I'm just glad I really wanted to drive home again you guys and you know I did mention you know\nKind of like how disruptive this can be because I Know which a lot of people get really really really\nJust caught up with the pace of life through the holidays in the holidays coming in you know my favorite holiday is ride around the corner\nAnd when we come into the holidays with the fed meeting two more times to raise interest rates what has taken place is that actually refinances have increased one point seven percent just within this month\nAnd when you look closely at kind of what the let's see time versus money concept is technology doesn't care about that\nWe can use technology as a tool but we can't use technology in order to really get into the core matters of time versus money\nAnd you know these are some topics that aren't necessarily you know\nGoing to be covered within this particular special episode of the future of finance but that's kind of where this is heading organically\nIs time versus money and it's not to create a sense of urgency for you to pick up the phone like I said before this is purely educational for you to decide when you want to pick up the phone or when it's going to be the most important time\nFor you to pick up the phone and have a conversation with Mickey\nI think at that time is now and I don't ever think of anything as a waste of time\nSo you may be feeling like well you know I'm really not quite ready to buy into the spring or maybe in the summer and I've had so many people over the years that have come to me and we just\nTalked about what it's going to look like and get that comfort level as yeah wow this is like the payments going to be this is where I'd like to be then you get into that area of which went hope\nAnd then I bring into reality but it's not bad because it's better to know how to time into going blind so I always say the time is now\nAnd you know that's a good point Mickey and that you know that's you know\nTired of it you know brings me to the fact that you know you you guys have heard Mickey speak directly to you about you know wanting a south facing driveway you know regarding you know the state of Colorado and I just wanted to make this very clear to you guys we have literally chosen\nCertain markets to really really assist with in the influx of what's coming in and out of the state of Colorado number one first and foremost from Colorado to Arizona and we all know the traveling back and forth of the snow bird\nThe reason why that's important is that a lot of people do not understand that December is the most busiest time of the year with in real estate\nA lot of real estate agents don't even know that and they kind of just set their whole calendar up to say okay well I'm just going to take this next two to three weeks off\nWhile I can assure you with Keller Williams international and then also how gateway mortgage group had to position themselves\nAnd make the camera and as a host with myself Christopher bread well on the future of finance this December is going to be\nOf the state of Colorado number one first and foremost from Colorado to Arizona and we all know the traveling back and forth of the snow bird\nThe reason why that's important is that a lot of people do not understand that December is the most busiest time of the year with in real estate\nA lot of real estate agents don't even know that and they kind of just set their whole calendar up to say okay well I'm just going to take this next two to three weeks off\nWell I can assure you with tell her Williams International and then also how gateway mortgage group had to position themselves\nAnd make the camera and as a host with myself Christopher bread well on the future of finance this December is going to be by far how it's going to have more closings within the state of Colorado\nJust because I have foresight within technology and what killer Williams has decided to do as far as purchasing certain bits and pieces of technology on the back end of even below\nOkay in order and I all you have to do is watch\nYou know you know basically watch the news even on that topic that I'm bringing up to you within talk radio is that\nZillow stock is down there's there's certain companies out there\nThat are even technology companies themselves that are being very very pressured and whether it in because of disruptive technology\nAnd you know that's why I'm bringing the real human being to you giving you the access of eight four four yes gate the way to your future so you actually have the opportunity to pick up the phone right now\nAnd speak directly to Mickey camera and and this is an opportunity for you guys that knocked it will always be there\nYou know and I just I Want to be honest with you so you don't get discouraged if you wait until December to pick up the phone and you can't even get a hold of Mickey camera and\nOh well well well well I have a strong team you will always be able to get a hold of me well\nThat's what I Want to hear because I care more about you as the listener than anything that has to do with necessarily even the future of finance and because of the history of the future of finance you know that to be a fact\nI mean when it comes down to rhino philosophy when it comes down to home life balance\nTo be honest with you this is just a tool in order for me to connect you with somebody who really cares and you know Mickey\nThat brings us to a real for main topic which is compassion within the financial and banking industry which those two words\nBecause of my history within the business as far as being an asset manager dealing with the secondary market you know working for some of the largest banks in the United states and you know just\nCompassion and financial banking industry\nAltogether it just like how do those words even how does that match how if you whether as being a woman of compassion\nOh you're kidding me it's not easy read every day they had that in ... got to share red tape Babylon\nCorporate\nTopic which is compassion within the financial and banking industry which those two words\nBecause of my history within the business as far as being an asset manager dealing with the secondary market you know working for some of the largest banks in the United states and you know just\nCompassion and financial banking industry\nAltogether it just like how do those words even how does that match how if you weathered as being a woman of compassion\nOh you're kidding me it's not easy not every day there's the intent structure red tape Babylon\nCorporate sometimes minutia that can make someone feel like they can't um uh-huh\nAnd that is what I feel in important to let everyone know that you can oh\nBaseball hotdog apple pie and owning your own home\nIt's a big part of being in this country it's your opportunity\nAnd sometimes they may be not right now but it will be and that is really a big piece of mine moved to gateway gateway is very passionate about empowering family\nAnd they have a very strong work ethic and environment and to me a big part of mortgage is accountability and integrity\nSome things are outside of our control sometimes things get a little high plains on an inspection Miller a value or whatever but I'm not going to turn tan and hide I'm right there up front and center with you negotiating\nI just you know as you're talking and I'm hearing that there's a real human being that is\nOn mass media that's physically reaching the airwaves as a host on the future of finance it gives me chills right now because you know and the fact that you can call one eight four four yes\nGate the way to your future is\nAbsolute it it just blows me away you guys ... and I'll tell you why\nIt really comes down to\nThree things you know and you know actually I'm not going to even tell you why\nGonna let Mickey tell you why\nWhat that experience is going to be like when you actually pick up the phone and you know before we go there\nI Want to just you know think every single every single one of my listeners [laughter] you know to you know to be sitting and listening closely why and I know why\nExperience is going to be like when you actually pick up the phone and you know before we go there\nI Want to just you know think every single every single one of my listeners [laughter] you know to you know to be sitting and listening closely why and I know why\nThree thousand dollars a month downtown Denver for a one bedroom loft like ... you know and they don't even know they can afford a home to purchase a home like what are some of the tools that you have in your little box\nIn order to be able to let them know that hey you know what you're not gonna have to resign that leaves you really go ahead\nI Would say critics from the first part of your question I'm where I came from and being at a major lender\nLarge banking institution I never realized all the rules and overlay that I had and I think over the years as what I can do now like gateway that I couldn't be then\nAll of them are people I could have helped seriously when I came to a gateway and I thought are minimal amount of overlays or in other words in the mortgage aids land that means extra world\nWide I kind of happy tears because they knew and I had so\nMuch more flexibility and the support of a team\nThat strong and under writers that are compassionate\nIt's a together in one big family a gateway\nAnd you know that's really neat because from my understanding and just so you guys know yeah I Do I Am on the tax side I Do wear the tech hat and a lot of things I Want to provide technical information on it's just the way I'm wired\nYou know and it does have to do with the rhino philosophy of being able to rally around\nAnd you know just to recap you know just kind of just to you know let those who may not know what the rhino philosophy is is in a lot of people don't know this but in Africa if there is a fire\nUp to like a hundred million I mean\nTo me it would be a hundred million miles away because I wouldn't be able to even make it probably five miles in the middle of the desert of Africa but up to a hundred miles away\nA rhino\nIt smells a fire in the jungle\nThe tax side I Do wear the tech hat and a lot of things I Want to provide technical information on it's just the way I'm wired you know and it does have to do with the Ryan or philosophy of being able to rally around\nAnd you know just to recap you know just kind of just to you know let those who may not know what the rhino philosophy is is in a lot of people don't know this but in Africa if there is a fire\nUp to like a hundred million I mean\nTo me it would be a hundred million miles away because I wouldn't be able to even make it probably five miles in the middle of the desert of Africa but up to a hundred miles away a rhino if it smells a fire in the jungle\n... some of the fastest moving animals\nAnd they will the whole herd won't run to where it sounds like an earthquake toward that fires that and they will run in a circle\nBefore\nIntel suffocate the fire and puts the fire out so that's really basically instead of this being you know a round table we're going to have gas coming on the show and you know instead of having it be a round table you guys have no idea how many rhinos\nThat are behind what we're doing here on the airwaves today there are so many rhinos that how are running already\nBeing proactive instead of reactive\nAnd circling around where they are already see this little tiny tiny fire that's going to start in the jungle which I'm basically using a an analogy for Wall Street gay because there are\nI'm not being negative by saying that there are going to be times that are changing because of technology because of the millennial generation who haven't been given the\nThe tools needed in ... and the education and knowledge like Mickey was saying of power the knowledge is power to be able to be calm homeowners become stable within their lives a lot of them have literally\nDriven themselves into debt to get the best possible education possible\nAnd\nThey think that they're stuck leasing at three thousand dollars a month you follow what I'm saying you guys so it's just really important you know and that's one of the things you know when I was actually going through the process of of\nYou know through rhinos giving suggestions and\nI mean I'm not going to go into bragging on what you know who these people are and the type of backing that we have in order to make sure that hopefully every single person in the United states get to hear what type of options they really do have to become a homeowner\nAnd also be able to position themselves to be able to weather the storm\nBut I'm telling you right now the first step is picking up the phone\nAnd not eight four four yes gate the way to your future again that's a four four yes gate the way to your future and Mickey you know your heart for the millennials for as you say the younger is\nSaying is something that before this episode and I really want you to kind of speak to them directly and make sure that they understand that they're not dealing with somebody who is detached from exactly where\nAt a absolutely absolutely it's just so much\nOf options they really do have to become a homeowner and also be able to position themselves to be able to weather the storm\nBut I'm telling you right now the first step is picking up the phone\nAnd not eight four four yes gate the way to your future again that a four four yes gate the way to your future and Mickey you know your heart for the millennials for as you say the young groups\nSay it's something that before this episode and I really want you to kind of speak to them directly and make sure that they understand that they're not dealing with somebody who is detached from exactly where\nThey're at Oh absolutely absolutely it's just so much potential and every moment in New and infinite potential\nAnd I know my talent my creativity and stream that truly profound and I can achieve anything\nWow you when you wake up in the morning at ... ... ... you can accomplish any end with tried even more so\nAnd you know what's interesting is is that's basically you know one of the reasons why Mickey camera and and this particular episode is so special because we are actually taking tons of resources and\nAll the tools that we have to make sure that this generation that's coming up that we're gonna have to give\nA major responsibility to\nThat they're well equipped better equipped than we ever war and that's by picking up the phone and calling a four four yes gate the way to your future again that aid for four yes gate the way to your future\nAnd we are not leaving the baby boomers behind\nThere are so many tools as far as on the remark reverse mortgage type of thing that Mickey I Know has but that's not what this particular episode of the future of finances about what is it about is making sure say for instance my identical twin boys look annoy just turned Eighteen\nOkay they both have had the best education their college has already paid for thank God\nBut the reality as they have no clue\nThat they could own a home right now I don't know why Mickey they don't teach with and like mainstream education even at the best universities and less someone's going to go to education specifically for finance and one of the things that I'm not saying this about any particular\nYou know educational institution but for some reason\nIt's like it's kinda like top secret private information on what it takes in order to be successful in real estate it's over ... don't tell aiding thing the hotel and how they can be six cents on [laughter] [laughter] you know\nDon't tell exactly you know so you guys pick up the phone at a four four yes gate the wage here future again that eight four four yes gate the way to your future and there's so many more topics\nThat we're going to be a clipping the millennials with especially within shows to come and ask this rose you know the San Francisco region or I\nEducation specifically for finance and one of the things that I'm not saying this about any particular\nYou know educational institution but for some reason\nIt's like it's kinda like top secret private information on what it takes in order to be successful in real

I remember it was an August and I'm thinking of a two towns have been Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on and talking about how people were losing trust in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was the only two groups\nI look at the share of vitriol and hatred on both sides\nIn what's been happening with Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Ford and all the rest of it and I don't care which side to that argument Iran first of all if you believe firmly believe one side or the other ... you have to realize we don't really have a lot of facts okay\nAnd you can they say well then that means ... that means y understand all that\nBut real lined the total lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and they will have consequences for the market and as I mentioned\nI have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay but I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor okay you know you have your ... and your are your uh see the eyes and ears for thousands or hundreds of these things right so how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different links and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got\nThey won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist\nBut he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two and he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecasters really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now\nAnd the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes [laughter] [laughter]\nAnd that's a lot of this that people use something because it's the best they think they've got but it's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things are really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market is supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make there's a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right\nBut we always make sure that when we wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing as opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do so again if you want to come out to a class I'm going to be teaching this one personally\nWhen you come out if you if you win ticket you get to free tickets you'll get a free tablet when you come out plus we will feed you lunch so if you want the free tickets be one of the next dozen\nCallers at eighty four forty eight trader that's T.
