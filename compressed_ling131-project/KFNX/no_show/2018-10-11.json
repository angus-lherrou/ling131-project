the show I bicycle in the bay\nNow what about to tell you I'm telling you because I didn't do what I felt like but I thought came through my mind I'm a former voter I've spent a lot of time on the

a performer and if you think this is an act you are mistaken\nEverything that I Do on the show I Do from the heart\nAnd I felt as though I had failed\nI'd failed my listeners I had failed America I

rather wisdom a crazy person is not defined by what he or she thinks crazy is what you do not what you think you understand what I just said you\nCrazy is what you do not what you think many people would like to go out and riot in the streets but they don't do it\nThey're not crazy the vermin on the left who go out and riot are crazy and violent and belong in prison\nThat's not free speech to beat people up in the streets but that's a separate topic for another day\nSo now I just get the news that without any help and the media\nI had a few shows here a few shows their band and blocked by

law in New York state\nYes and Connecticut\nOkay fine question what can a citizen legally do to defend him or herself if they are attacked by a mob in a restaurant and they're not my money in your own business and Bob starts screaming at them get out of my restaurant you support Trump what what can they do\nThey can stand their ground and physical each day they can demand that the premise is the owner of the major deal waiter give them security they can demand that their meal ether and that they'd be free of harm if they don't if they don't provide that sort of a protection for their patrons um in the interest of just\nPersonal safety you can leave\nAnd if you were pushed and they take to the next level you're physically touched or your wife it's physically touched in New York state you

uh Portland, Oregon I mean the ... the cop was on a motorcycle and the same street they were doing this to people the black lives matter people calling them every name under the sun and re directing traffic\nOr you can blame the cop and not playing the copy blame the mayor is the issue here\nBut what's the good of blaming anybody if they attacked the man who was in a car is Seventy years old and started banging on this call with sticks what what could he do\nThat he got out for some reason I Know the video you're talking about oh man and elected he jumped out to look at it and he actually did

you're gonna um introduced legislation to fund the whole wall I don't believe you\nSee that shit I don't I don't believe that the Republicans by the way\n\nI I don't get angry at me I I I don't

to\nAnd I know a lot of Trump supporters have a hard time wrapping their arms around that because they don't believe we can say anything negative are critical about the president well yeah I I'm an American I can say anything negative or critical about anybody and I get I understand because I served in Congress I Know\nThat most of the Republicans in Congress don't want the wall\nNow that's just the fact\nI understand that what Trump's up against a but still Trump hasn't made any effort right most\nRepublicans in Congress you need to know this if you don't already know it most Republicans in the house and most Republicans in the Senate do not want\nTo wall they don't want it at all\nWhen Kevin McCarthy comes out today and says they're gonna introduce legislation to fund the whole law I

author speaking and so much more and and you can check her a\nWeb site at and the contact information to the towards the end of the show a tonight's topic is is ferries\nAnd some of the questions we're going to ask is do you believe in ferries and ferries help you manifest abundance enjoy how can you connect with the fairies to fulfill your purpose in a prosperous way welcome to the show on the long\nThank you so much Carol thank you for having me [noise] I have\nTo admit as well as I'm sure some of the listeners Courtney that does some people have been skeptical about fairies but uh when I went to a restaurant last week in Tempe two women we're talking about fairies and they saw one\n[noise] so what exactly what do we mean Percival by of theory was tinker bell of theories that type of image your what are you mean life here\nYeah great question ferries are nature angels or guardians of the planet that they exist in a higher dimension a higher vibration\nThan we humans do and their job is to help take care of the environment and to also bring a lot of joy to the planet so joy to people joy to let's say animals plants their goal is to uplift us\nAnd tinker bell is a great example of a ferry although you know varies don't look like cartoons like tinker bell but that idea of a little being that has a lot of light and almost magical I sense that can\nUplift and transform and and helps thanks to feel lighter\n[noise] what are they made a uses light mhm is that that that's the route of so yeah ...\nExactly ferries are made of light so if you were to actually see a ferry and and some people have the ability to see fairies many of us haven't yet mastered that ability\nI'm I'm very grateful I've seen ferries and sometimes they just look like a circle of lights like a little or or a circle of light sometimes theories will actually have\nA light body or they look just kinda like tinker bell but instead of being so detailed there just made of like so they might have a body you know I had arms legs and wings and the wings are a basically a representation of their or a or their energy field\nUplift and transform and and to help things to feel lighter\nWhat are they made a uses light mhm is that that that's the route of yeah\nExactly ferries are made of light so if you were to actually see a ferry and and some people have the ability to see fairies many of us haven't yet mastered that ability\nI'm I'm very grateful I've seen ferries and sometimes they just look like a circle of light like a little blurb or circle of light sometimes ferries will actually have\nA light body or they look just kinda like tinker bell but instead of being so detailed there just made of light so they might have a body you know a head arms legs and wings and the wings are a basically a representation of their or a or their energy field\n[noise] so where do they are as we're they come from initially ... how would they created so to speak\nYeah so that's a great question theories were created pretty much from the beginning of time just like the animals to humans the ah elements of nature so series also in body different aspects of nature there's water ferry stairs\nBoth true voice of Arizona independent draw eleven hundred ...\n\nWelcome back every one welcome to the ... [noise]\nAnd we are talking to a court in the long going to continue on with the importance\nAnd he's ugly the ferries are coming in stronger they're making their presence known to many people and they want to rebuild the connection to basically I'm a repaired their relationship that humans and ferries have had\nIn order to help the planet as we know the planet is shifting going through many changes the actual earth itself as well as the people on the planet right we're just going through so many changes\nAnd the areas wants to help I still live at our lives to take better care of the environment and they want to work together with us to do that because their mission their purpose is to really raise the vibration of the planet to help\n'em just bring more love more joy more cooperation mark herring and nurturing\nAnd so they do that by helping us because we are also caretakers of the planet so ferries want us to do things like recycle and be kind to each other how they really encourage us to have more fun and stopped taking life so seriously stop holding grudges and\nI'm being mean to ourselves they prefer that we are much kinder to our own selves as well so that they're basically saying\nSo many changes and the areas wants to help us to live better lives to take better care of the environment and they want to work together with us to do that because their mission their purpose is to really raise the vibration of the planet to help\n'em just bring more love more joy more cooperation mark herring and nurturing\nAnd so they do that by helping us because

holding grudges and\nI'm being mean to ourselves they prefer that we are much kinder to our own selves as well so that they're basically saying the time is now\nFor anyone who might feel a calling to connect with fairies or even just be happy the time is now we don't want to delay our happiness for later but to actually make happiness a priority right now today in our own lives\nSo are we conscious of of a ferry and their vibrations around\nThat's a great question we can be but most of us don't even realize and and one of the ways I Know the ferries are around me is when I just get happy for no reason or I just start laughing about something for no reason\nAnd I think wait a minute where did that come from and then when I tuned in I can feel the presence of the ferries so the ferries want us to just be happier and they will do things around us to just make us laugh and they communicate energetically\nJust through vibration through energy and they also can even communicate tell a passively mind to mind communication so they could whisper something funny in your ear that you might think is just a thought in your mind just the kind of a funny thought and it's actually a theory trying to communicate with you but they can be around\nUm [noise] they will come around more often if you invite them to though they're they're very shy although they're also very assertive and confident but they also tend to be shy and they're they're not interested in\nUh messing with us or if there's even all these stories of fairies hiding people's socks or hiding their belongings it's sometimes the ferries will do that to be playful but for the most part the ferries wanting to interact with people who want to interact with them\nIt's like if you invite them to be part of your life and you get to know them they're going to come around a lot more often\nOr do they give show was any tangible thing like you for pennies from heaven deputy brings eagles talking about that these you know people who've passed uh-huh and do they ever show was anything tangible\nOh well if they move objects that that is actually you know something tangible they'll do it and I remember when I was growing up\nI Would often be missing socks and you know the the old story of like oh the the laundry machine the washer ate the Sox are but I Would be like where my socks and I would go into my sister's room and look in her drawer\nIn her dresser and there would be my socks and I would ask my sister why did you take my sucks and she would deny it and said she didn't take my socks and I just used to think she was lying\nBut now as an adult that I understand how ferries work I actually believe that the fairies took my socks and hit them in my sister's sure just to be playful and silly and and to make us laugh of course I never left about was annoyed that my husband [laughter] but they can actually\nEven though they're made of light they have a dense enough\nActually you do something tangible they'll do it and I remember when I was growing up\nI Would often be missing socks and you know the the old story of like oh the the laundry machine the washer ate the Sox are but I Would be like where my socks and I would go into my sister's room and look in her drawer\nIn her dresser and there would be my socks and I would ask my sister why did you take my socks and she would deny it and say she didn't take my socks and I just used to think she was lying\nBut now as an adult that I understand how ferries work I actually believe that the fairies took my socks and hit them in my sister's store just to be playful and silly and and to make us laugh of course I never left about was annoyed that myself [laughter] but they can actually\nEven though they're made of light they have a dense enough they ... they can move physical objects and the other thing that I think it's really neat is\nTheories love chocolate they have a sweet tooth they love chocolate\nAnd there's and basically some guidance that we can leave chocolate out for them to offer them something almost like a little gift here's some chocolate for the ferries so one time I did that in my backyard\nAnd I was praying it didn't melt in the hot Arizona son but it was cooler day so I left this chocolate out and I checked on it maybe two days later and the chocolate was still there and I thought to myself law\nFerries just aren't real they didn't eat my chocolate [laughter] and then I realize later well they're not physical they can't eat chocolate oh they can smell it they can just kind of enjoy the essence of it and so yeah it's pretty interesting that they love chocolate they love sparkly things\nAnd you can even leave things in your yard for them such as crystal it's like I Love to hang Christmas from trees or\nThose little sparkly garden ornaments that they have a big circle or ... anything sparkly they absolutely love they love colors and sparkles\nThey like Ninety five percent to ... [laughter] yes of course [laughter]\nI'm there any people that they do not want to\nThat the fairies but not ... oh my gosh wonderful question they tend to stay away from people who are mean and who don't care for the environment people who maybe don't even care about recycling or don't care about\nA helping others that they really want to help the people that are helping to make the world a better place with like the theories have that's very important purpose of uplifting the planet\nAnd they want to connect with people who feel a sense of purpose in themselves to help make the world a better place for people who feel like they've they've got some kind of mission or life purpose that involves helping other people or sharing their gifts to make the world a better place\n[noise] actually I was talking to somebody ... during the break was telling you that about fairy guard garden that is a it does this invite fairies war\nAt yes and it's become quite a thing nowadays there's all kinds of stores selling ferried garden item like little benches for the ferries are a little swings or doors you can put on a tree\nAnd the theories can be present in a garden regardless if\nThere's these little knickknack are ferried garden type things or not that's ferries loved being nature especially wild nature they would prefer let's say a field of wildflowers more than a very well manicured garden ... but but they're going to be anywhere nature is any way\nBut if you set up a theory garden you add some crystals or sparkly\n[noise] actually I was talking to somebody ... during the break was telling you that about fairy guard garden that is a it does this invite fairies\nAbsolutely yes and it's become quite a thing nowadays there's all kinds of stores selling ferry garden items like little benches for the ferries are a little swings or doors you can put on a tree\nAnd the theories can be present in a garden regardless if\nThere's these little knickknack sir ferry garden type things or not it's Therese loved being nature especially wild nature they would prefer let's say a field of wildflowers more than a very well manicured garden ... but but they're going to be anywhere nature is any way\nBut if you set up a ferry garden you add some crystals or sparkly things or you add a little theory bench\nThey will steal your arms and your intention that you want to connect with them so they will be more likely to come if you're creating a warm inviting space for them and they love to gather in circles so you can even set up\nA circle of rocks just even small little rocks for them to gather and because there is love to have fun they they love community and they loved to party and and just have a good time in a circle and it doesn't have to be a circle but it's it's like the sense of community ...\nDrawing but very I tried exactly native yeah Eric ... well I'm\n\n[laughter] and it was very interesting yeah I could be five hours [laughter] helping people was talking about okay um have you witnessed any such um incident where a theory to help someone\n[noise] yeah oh my gosh so many incidents where they've helped people and a lot of times\nIt's helping to bring an opportunity to someone for instance someone who is looking for a job and they might have had a job interview and the the interview didn't go very well they didn't get the job so they actually called on\nTheir team of angels and ferries and said\nYou know I really want your help finding the right opportunity or the right job and then they might run into someone at a coffee shop strike up a conversation and that person connects them with a much better job than they could have ever imagined\nSo lots of times the series will work in our lives I must behind the scenes to assist us\nAnd to bring in lock ... exactly we might just say oh that was luck exactly but it could be very well our angels and ferries orchestrating opportunities for us to angels and theories worked together\nThey do but they're they're I don't either slightly different okay but similar but the the easiest way to say is angels ... love theories\n... joy okay mom well we're going to be right back maybe continue with some stories how's that going absolutely okay great\nYou can do and many lives series\nA mini ...\nOkay well we're going to be right back maybe continued some stories that have so many great\nAnd once you decide what you want step number two is it clear so deep layer what you want first of all to yourself and it's like being honest with yourself about what you want to clear it\nAnd then start declaring it to others and what I mean by declare it to all the bird it oh okay exactly so they might be like I might tell you ... you know I'm declaring that I get to fly to Europe next month we're a new speaking opportunity about the series\nSomething like that and so I'm declaring I'm kind of like putting it out there in the world and by doing that you might say well wait a minute I Know someone in Europe who wants to have a ferry presentation\n... it's kind of like that's the way it works we we can't just rely on the ferry to do things for us but the part of the step\nIs to get in our power to be confident and to declare that we want something that we are claiming it for ourselves not that we're asking not that we're almost like begging you know please ferries helped me\nThey don't like that and all they want us to be strong confident in our power to declare what we are creating in our lives\nAnd step number three is to do it that this diverge taking action or it could be for instance with that example if I'm manifesting speaking opportunities I might start researching what places\nOffer workshops and you know what places a Taco Bell series or might be interested in fairy so it's it's up to us to do our action as well so it's decide declare and do it\nMhm mhm and you mentioned European countries which European countries have more of a connection now\nYeah definitely Ireland Arnold ... yeah\nAbsolutely so many Mary's there and I was actually just this past July I was in Germany and Austria working with some clients and connecting with fairies in Germany and Austria and I didn't know there were so many ferries there but there are tons and tons which just so beautiful\nAnd did they talk about it openly no they don't really\nKnow although of the clients I was working with you [laughter] what they were a small group of people [laughter]\nRight yeah absolutely they don't talk about\nNot in general no it would mean some certain people do and I I feel like from what I understand people are becoming more\nMhm and you mentioned European countries which European countries have more of a connection now\nYeah definitely Ireland Arnold ... yeah\nAbsolutely so many Mary's there and I was actually just this past July I was in Germany and Austria working with some clients and connecting with fairies in Germany and Austria and I didn't know there were so many ferries there but there are tons and tons which just so beautiful\nAnd did they talk about it openly no they don't really\nKnow although of the clients I was working with you [laughter] but they were a small group of people\n[laughter] right yeah absolutely they don't talk about it\nNot not in general oh no I mean some certain people do and I I feel like from what I understand people are becoming more and more open to it but not everybody you know some people still very skeptical and traditional\nRight OK mhm wow yeah\nYeah obviously but we were one day the clients and I were in\nA forest and there were beautiful beautiful lake and oh my goodness I could just feel the fairies and I started to do a little video that I was going to post later on Facebook and I could feel the fairies and then in the video\nWas a very very clear image of the theory you can see the the shape of a body and it just looks like a bright light and and it showed up in a photo also and it's just it's so stunning and then we were also and there's other area of the forest\nAnd we were communicating with these very being that felt very ancient very old and they had some very important messages to share\nHow I'm just curious how can you feel a ferry around\nYeah so we can feels the ferries it it might show up differently for each person but\nVery tend to feel very light so you'll notice light kind of sensations in your body you might have letters and your heart\nNot any kind of medical issue or heart heart ... you know like little exactly little letters or sometimes your your shoulders might feel light\nOr you might get like those little butterflies in your stomach but more a sense of excitement not necessarily fear but just excitement or a feeling of joy that does washes three you like a wave of energy coming from your stomach up through the top of your head\nMhm yeah so what I'm getting is because it is so momentary momentarily it's you'd never know when you're going to connect or feel or any of that\nExactly ... exactly and and it's more likely to happen if you're in nature and ... in a very special area like Sedona, Arizona so sacred just the red rock mountains are so sacred and I'll often feel ferries out on the trail but not\nOn the trail it's like maybe if I go into a little forest area where it just feels very calm and still\nStand there and tune in and and maybe close my eyes take a couple a deep breath to really feel because a lot of times we're in our heads ... numbers so distracted by our own thinking and so it's about slowing down the thinking and feeling more in our bodies and just\nTuning in we're all intuitive I mean we all have the ability to communicate with fairies\nEvery single person on the planet it's just a matter of slowing ourselves down learning how or intuition works and interesting it puts the stereotypical communicate like I said even tell the ... so you might get a message that might just seem like a thought in your mind but it's actually coming right from\nSacred and I often feel ferries out on the trail but not\nOn the trail it's like maybe if I go into a little forest area where it just

who's the fellow a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in a great columnist for the Washington Post and one of the few conservative people at that paper Brett how are\nYou say I was going to call you Brett mark cheats and welcome to the program I view it it I I Want to tell you something before we get into Kavanaugh but it kind of relates to cap it off the me too movement start with Harvey Weinstein and in that case\nAnd I guess there's a big development in that case that one of the major accusers of Harvey Weinstein they found a bunch of emails and things on a computer she left behind her last job\nAnd it turns out she had a friendly long term relationship with a guy although she apparently described it as she said I hate\nFeeling like it's a booty goal and I'm Wondering if\nThat whole case is going to start blowing up in front of us and and since it's the sort of the the bedrock of this whole me too movement it started everybody taking a a tough look at at the bad behavior of some people I'm Wondering what effect that might have I was I've been reading that and I got a little discombobulated so\nI'm On my first reaction to that one out of like what Seventy say ... you're not an end to even if she did continue to have a relationship like a\n... like talk you know I mean Monica Lewinsky wasn't a a wasn't a or unwilling participant that said it was a power relationship that was on just a part of the United states at the White House ... like you know it's that I and and that's not even power situation so she could very well have been depending on our be watching for career\nOr at least try to keep it as good raises despite a sexual predator tradition so I don't think that that's necessarily just positive and you know\nNot necessarily story but apparently there's a bit of splitting the da's office about whether or not those charges should be dropped but let's talk about capping off because sure yesterday or earlier this week Hillary Clinton comes out and effectively not effectively she says you'll get in civility back in American society that you know all the\nAntifa marches and the you know the nonsense and the violence and the shot at threats and a visiting senators' offices or not their offices their homes in the middle of the night all of that will end when you give us power back or are we going to be able to\nAre we going to be able to have a civil society or other Democrats simply going to say will cause trouble 'til you give us the reins of power back\nWell that's\nAnd so she could very well have been depending on Harvey Weinstein for her career a and plus trying to keep it as good prices despite a sexual predator predation so I don't think that that necessarily dispositive and you know\nNot not necessarily story but apparently there's a bit of splitting the da's office about whether or not those charges should be dropped but let's talk about Kavanaugh's because sure yesterday or earlier this week Hillary Clinton comes on and effectively and not effectively she says you'll get incivility back in American society that you know all the\nAntifa marches and the you know the nonsense and the violence of the shot at threats and a visiting senators' offices or not their offices their homes in the middle of the night all of that will end when you give us power back or are we going to be able to\nYou are we going to be able to have a civil society or or the Democrats simply going to say will cause trouble 'til you give us the reins of power back\nWell that's a view and looked at I mean I I don't know how much lower you'd go then accusing someone to participating in an organizing gang rapes [laughter] without any evidence whatsoever\nBut apparently they and according to Politico the Democrats thinks that they're the lesson from the Kavanaugh experiences they need to be more ruthless just just ... mind boggling more ruthless and they've been that basically that we are are we are just\nRude that we're just on principle and the pursuit of power will do anything to get power and their two principled into kind them too soft and so\nYou know they're they're they're that's that they need to be tougher as what they've taken from all this which is just you know I mean the fact of the matter is that what the left always does first of all they they they made their two reasons why Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court than they're both fault the Democrats' number one they filibustered Neil Gorsuch\nAnd as a result the Republicans went nuclear do you think for a second that Mitch McConnell would have been able to most of the votes\nLast week to go first to nuclear option to get right to have it on the port of course not the the the reality is is that they\nThey screwed themselves by filibustering a perfectly qualified\nOr a universally respected justice for the Supreme Court and so that\nThey had no power whatsoever to stop capital and then the second thing is they always overreach you know ... that Christine Blasey Ford has her\nStory started falling apart but at least there was some issue seems credible to most most Americans disassociate volunteer something then they start coming up with a temper a mirror store his piece in the New Yorker and then Michael have and that he comes out with this ridiculous you know these were ridiculous a affidavit that\nYou know he was standing in line to wait his turn with girls and you know all the rest of it and then gang rapes\nAnd just it it you know they overreached and so the lesson is not to to to do more of that the lesson that literally helps\nConfirmed Brett Kavanaugh because there were attorneys are so ridiculous that Republicans then Israel is able to save lives oh look this is just absurd uh and I don't believe they do those charges and bloody fortunately not ... not true either\nSo they actually they actually helped Kavanaugh's case by going overboard and by with their attacks on first on Gorsuch and then on Kavanaugh so the lesson is be smarter something stupid\nAnd I guess I Hope you don't mean by and I think the Democrats may say being smarter means we have to have a better pack of lives that are less track of all you know and and a better set of stories\nAnd I hope they don't do that but frankly mark look I Know I'm critical of the media and I mean the me I'm part of the media but I'm critical of the mainstream because I don't think they're doing their jobs and I'm Wondering I'm Wondering if you joined me in this because you remember when when David Duke was supposed to have endorsed Donald Trump\nAnd and they said well I mean Donald Trump has to disclaimer that connection right away\nWell Mark I guarantee you there or at least a few people listen to my show who may be nasty individuals you know I think the vast majority are nice folks but I don't know everybody who listens to my show there are millions of people in the radio audience so you know so that somebody says hey there's this full on bigot from Alabama who just he loves your show and he hates everybody in the world because\nBe smarter something stupid\nAnd I guess I Hope you don't mean by ... and I think the Democrats may say being smarter means we have to have a better pack of lives that are less track of all you know and and a better set of stories and I hope they don't do that but frankly\nMark look I Know I'm critical of the media and I mean to me I'm part of the media but I'm critical of the mainstream because I don't think they're doing their jobs and I'm Wondering I'm Wondering if you joined me in this because you remember when when David Duke was supposed to have endorsed Donald Trump and and they said well I mean Donald Trump has to disclaimer that connection right away\nWell Mark I guarantee you there or at least a few people who listen to my show who may be nasty individuals you know I think the vast majority are nice folks but I don't know everybody who lives in my show there are millions of people in the radio audience so\nYou know so that somebody says hey there's this full on big it from Alabama who just he loves your show and he hates everybody in the world because of their skin color race religion et cetera\nAnd I say my response would be I don't control what people think and the fact that he likes my show or endorses my candidate for mayor dog catcher whatever\nDoes not really mean much of anything unless I embrace that endorsement well in this case I'm not seeing any make any\nMembers of the mainstream media going to politicians right or left and saying and especially on the left ... Barbara Boxer and Chuck Schumer and the rest and say we'll you\nCondemn these tactics their tactics where violence is done where you know about the protests are made and and you show up at the centers house in the middle of the night and harass his wife things like will you do that\nThey will go to Donald Trump in Bolivia room for a week to say please come out of displaying David Duke I think at the end of the day he did um but but they're not doing any of that in a case like this so they pick and choose when does say it's a major story this week that you know that that\nSenator so and so will or won't a disclaimer this kind of behavior or by people who were advocating against Brett Kavanaugh ... is there any reasonable explanation for why reporters would say well it's not important to ask\nThem last yeah they're biased\nI mean why does this I honestly there's so many holds up and poked into testing lousy Fort story that somebody an investigative journalists ought to be going out and saying was there some coordination here with this whole plant a little ... you know the way it let's do talk to people enter high school and find out a little bit more about her\nA let's talk to us find out or is there coordination between Senate Democrats and her lawyers\nOr how did the story leak why we why we still don't know how to steam bloody force letter came out and to the press there there's a there's a lot of stuff here that that is worthy of investigation and I don't think any of them going to do it\nYou know they have no curiosity to do because it doesn't mean they were to find out yesterday or\nLast year or so why why should they why should a a waste and energy\nI mean they can spend all kinds of time on on other lesser things like you know whether or not to certain people in Trump's administration at very low levels of the campaign or you know allied with somebody else but in this case where it actually controlled whether or not a man would become the Supreme Court justice that he is today or whether his he'd be ruined and his name be smart forever\nI'm no no ... there at all and and and I guess I just wonder if these reporters or have any self awareness of saying we're because they'll tell you that they're unbiased that their objective journalism they're just telling the news well then why not treat those stories equivalent because the Duke example was maybe a poor one but\nThere are lots of examples where the press will spend inordinate amounts of in time and energy tracking down he is there a connection here or not and you had this one is like no not even interested in looking into it\nWas just I mean the the press is really just in the cloud itself and the whole thing and just to to shape the is an eddy charges like there were even credible to treat the Ramirez story like that was ... I mean it's just that\nControlled whether or not a man would become the Supreme Court justice that he is today or whether his he'd be ruined and his name be smart forever\nI'm no no ... there at all and and and I just I just wonder if these reporters or have any self awareness of saying we're because they'll tell you that they're unbiased that their objective journalism they're just telling the news well then why not treat those stories equivalent because the Duke example was maybe a poor one but\nThere are lots of examples where the press will spend inordinate amounts of in time and energy tracking down is there a connection here or not and you had this one is like no not even interested in looking into\nA system in the press is really just you know the cloud itself in the whole war thing and just to see the is an eddy charges like that or even credible treat the Ramirez story like it was credible I mean is it just it they you know\nFact I almost think there's a whole book on that I don't exactly have the time to write it but if you think about it most of the assassins in American history\nSee her hands here had\nJohn Wilkes booth\nIf you think about the people who have committed political assassinations\nLee Harvey Oswald not exactly a right wing conservative if you know what I mean\nAnd so\nThe left uses these kinds of tactics there right does not when antifa shows up in your town be sure to have the fire department in sublease an ambulances on hand when the Tea Party shows up on the Capitol mall in Washington DC they usually leave the place cleaner than it was when they arrived\nIs there a reason to do that this isn't pointed out routinely I Know that most reporters working for TV channels they want to find a kind of a moral equivalence well both sides do it\nActually that's not true is not backed up by the facts has not backed up by history so and somebody like Hillary Clinton vows that civility we'll only returned when the left gets its power back\nIt reminds me of a four year old and the grocery store in the cereal aisle with mom who is screaming at the top of his lungs holding his breath while ... screaming you can't be holding his breath but he's screaming at the top of his lungs and stamping his feet\nAnd civility is only going to return when the captain crunch goes into mom shopping basket we understand it it's not rational behavior but it is the kind of behavior you expect perhaps from juvenile children it is not the kind of behavior that America ought to have to tolerate coming from\nAdults simply because they identify with the left side of the trial let's go to ...\nActually that's not true is not backed up by the facts has not backed up by history so when somebody like Hillary Clinton vows that civility we'll only

to show for us and giving several\nThank you very much they only say that so we can spend most of the time your point\nOkay I thought that look at it the deplorable there's pain and itchy and taxpayer money trying to piss cabin out to be a sexual predator\nAround finance bill and Hillary Clinton on a democratic rally taller than the actual Pettitte Clinton Clinton the guy that they have it I think\nNow you did you notice Hillary Clinton saying well the charges against my husband she actually said this week are were different the accusations were different and I read that I thought yeah they were different\nBecause the charges against I mean Bill Clinton never contested that he had sexually harassed and molested Kathleen willy who came to the oval office asking for help he never contested that he had to elicit an illicit affair with Monica\nYou know uh and and he never did not now of course he would not admit that he raped Juanita Broderick but that story is so well\nFounded and well evidence and Juanita Roderick who's been on this program not long ago just for a couple of weeks ago during the whole cabinet business um she explained that she told somebody about the assault the rate that Bill Clinton put her through within thirty\nMinutes of it happening and she remember the details you then told other people in her close circle of friends and she told them why she feared reporting it because the man who had raped or Bill Clinton\nWas the attorney general and he controlled the industry in which he owned two nursing homes the attorney general of Arkansas that time maybe still a controls the nurses nurse nursing home business he had the power to put her out of business so\nYou know Bill Clinton was accused accurately\nSewing Hillary says they were different I'm sure that was in what she meant but it's what my response would be your bed it was it was a different the charges against Kavanaugh were unfounded on evidence to none proved and the charges against your husband as an colder calls him the horny hick from Arkansas\nWere very well established by the way how does a great night sleep\nImprove your performance I Know what it does remind how

night sleep teen asleep numbers thirty five sometimes she puts in forty or forty five\nSo when Hillary says they were different I'm sure that was in what she meant but it's what my response would be your bed it was it was a different the charges against Kavanaugh were unfounded on evidence to non proved and the charges against your husband as an colder calls him the horny hick from Arkansas were

I have a lot of people that say well my phone you know doesn't last forever ... do you know what for every than eat [laughter] I mean did it ever last\nTen hours they didn't ever go eight hours and they said well just seems like you know her\nMy computers running slower my hard drive ball anything or whether it be a blue your blood level your blood sugar levels or or your car range gas mileage if you don't keep track of that data point over time you know idea that something's wrong and so that might be a good reminder I was just looking at this you'll you'll be happy to know what's covered by Medicare for those who qualify\nOut see he's ... he's making a he's making a micro regression on me by by mentioning gotta than in in about six months or\nFive months I'm going to be six years old so I'm not qualified dramatic and by the way I had to get a prescription for those damn thing and I told my doctor and she and she says you don't need this medically and I go yeah but I Want it I I Want to try it out and I still pay for my with my own money of after the meter itself is like\nSeventy bucks in the last I assume it'll probably less five six years you you charge it up with the now ubiquitous minute micro USDA and to be not to see and I have to charge it I don't know once every ten days or so and it's it's really kinda handy and in any way I I think it's a it's a great little innovation and\nIt sticks to me and there's a tiny little filament that sticks in my skin but when I first put it on I thought all feel a little stick like I Do my finger didn't even feel a thing it's like holy cow\nI Need a prescription to prick yourself with the old school that\nWe see this is I don't I don't know if they ... I don't know why because I said to my doctor I don't understand was prescription anyway and I'm not asking for a bottle of oc say\nI'm a I'm asking for a meter it is like getting a prescription for a tape measure\nAnd she said well I don't either but but uh but you have to have one so I got as long as they are and I said hey I Want to buy one of these and they go now cancelled so you have to have prescription like what what was just stupid and and frankly the little cheaply meters at Wal Mart\nThey're like twelve bucks and you don't need a prescription and the scripture twenty or thirty cents apiece so it's just you know you can save some money but there is a beauty if you actually made people pay for it I think the prices would come down but because they're like oh it's covered by insurance\nStick like I Do want to write my finger didn't even feel a thing like\nYou know you need a prescription to prick yourself with the old school I Know\nSee this is up and and I don't I don't know if they ... I don't know why because I said to my doctor I don't understand was prescription anyway and I'm not asking for a bottle of oc say\nI'm a I'm asking for a meter it is like getting a prescription for a tape measure\nAnd she said well I don't either but but uh but you have to have one so I got as long as you are and I said hey I Want to buy one of these and they go no cancelled so you have a prescription like what was once do stupid and and frankly the little cheaply meters at Wal Mart\nThey're like twelve bucks and you don't need a prescription and the scripture twenty or thirty cents apiece so interesting you know you can save money but there is a beauty if you actually made people pay for it I think the prices would come down but because of like oh it's covered by insurance and they so they just say well we can charge you know\nI my wife was stunned a few years ago I said well you pick up pick me up fifty\nTesters I'm using one of these one ... and they were er and she comes back to science fifty strips of sixty five dollars on why why well out of the game and the insurance companies anyway\nLet me ask you this let me ask you about gender filters on job sites use that\nA form of discrimination and is it legitimate for a company to say we are more interested in males or females in this particular job and do you think they're doing\nIt and yeah and and and then the question whether we're there doing it or not we'll get to in a second I'm going to kind of the fence on this on and I know you hate that but let me give you both sides of the coin here on side number one the argument is\nThey want more diversity in hiring they want the candidate pool they want page one page to page three of the results to reflect the overall mix of gender now the reason they haven't had\nAny consideration I Believe develop or is it linked and now of course owned by Microsoft had done a really good job of keeping gender out of the equation and developers have said we don't want to even enter that into the data pool we don't want to know about it because it's not necessarily relevant now what they're saying they're saying well we want to encourage diversity\nBite subtly encouraging if there's a a sixty percent female applicants indoor pool of responses to your linked in ad we're going to put sixty percent of females on page one sixty percent of females on page to and so on and so forth so I get\nThe intent I get the goal I get the purpose I'm just not sure that I Want my technology provider like linked in to be shoveling the result in such a way they could consciously or unconsciously determine who I hire\nI Believe the best candidate should be hired regardless of race and that's where the ... question comes in or we now putting that front and center on the same token I think we can all agree anything that helps that company a much more diverse\nIs a good thing so it's really\nActually I probably disagree with you there just because\nLook if you're going to ask for the best candidates Brian if God Forbid you end up in the hospital you you've probably been once or twice and I wanted her to have been there with family members I haven't been in the hospitals are patients since I was a kid but if you do that\nWhat gender will be the predominant gender among nurses\nI Would say female female and I've looked at the numbers or something like eighty five to Ninety percent so should we told our hospitals will you should filters so that the job candidates you look at her fifty ... actually fifty one female forty nine men would you accept that and say you have to leave it no go ahead\nIf if the large if the market is eighty five it here say you walk into a hospital in the marketing eighty five percent female\nAnd you get eighty five percent female applicants now that number may vary five ten percent one way or the other but at the market as a whole is eighty five percent females you're going to get a five percent female applicants so the question is not are you getting the applicants for the first place the question is are you seeing the same mix of applicants page after page after page\nAnd and have been there with family members I haven't been in the hospitals are patients since I was a kid but if you do that\nWhat gender will be the predominant gender among nurses\nI Would say female female and I've looked at the numbers at something like eighty five Ninety percent so should we told our hospitals will you should filters so that the job get it as you look at her fifty fifth actually fifty one female forty nine men would you accept that and say you have to leave it no go ahead\nIf if the if the market is eighty five and say you walk into a hospital the marketing eighty five percent female\nAnd you get eighty five percent female applicants now that number may very high temperatures that one way or the other but at the market as a whole it's eighty five percent you know you're going to get ... percent female applicants so\nThe question is not getting the applicants for the first place the question is saying the same mix of applicants page after page after page well and the results will ultimately be the same\nI guess I Would just rather they rank order people and said here the people with the best test scores are the best whatever metric you want to use to measure their capabilities and and give us those candidates well it turns out they're all female or almost all female soldier will do I\nWant the best interest I don't want the nurse in in the proper rainbow you know with the diversity actually I'd once more Republican nurses instead Democrat nurses that\nThe hell does that mean for me to overeat you may will create too many jobs were ... were willing to much were present well you know the\nPresident said he does he he predicted we become weary of winning and and I don't want us to become wary of winning\nAnd here's your economic lesson for today and it's a lesson that a lot of these schools at the Federal Reserve\nBank and they had a lot of these games and it kind of us don't understand when the economy is is cooking like it is now\nWhere you've got you know near full employment you got four percent growth you've got\nYou know more jobs for people to fill them\nYou've got more and more production you know that means the economy is producing more goods and services now my question to you our says\nWhen you get an increase in the output of goods and services what happens is the price of things if they're ... county produces more apples what happens is the price apples to apples doesn't rise it calls you up till I reject this notion I'm so glad\nYou mentioned this concept of overeating 'cause it's a bogus\nTypes that you know we had great growth of eight percent under Reagan you remember that yeah why can't the economy grow up four or five percent\nIn China and India had some tremendous growth rates as well they say why we've got a moment do I do I did plan to ask you about this what you call the credit rating agency racket described as for my listeners about how these government agencies have been ... you know putting the USDA approved stamp on on\nOn a whole bunch of credits that really doesn't deserve that and and they helped create some of the problem\nThe economy is producing more goods and services now my question is is when you get an increase in the output of goods and services what happens is the ... county produces more apples what happens is the price samples of apples doesn't rise had Paul's yup so I reject\nThis notion I'm so glad you mentioned this concept of overeating 'cause it's a bogus\nTypes that you know we had rates growth of eight percent under Reagan you remember that you know why can't the economy grow up four or five percent\nWell in in China and India had some tremendous growth rate does well they say why we've got a moment do I do I did plan to ask you about this what you call the credit rating agency racket\nDescribed as for my listeners about how these government agencies have been ... you know putting the USDA approved stamp on on on a whole bunch of credits that really doesn't deserve that and and they helped create some of the problem right\nThis is one of the great scandals of the two thousand seven and two thousand they are real estate\nYou know a crisis which led to a belt out in the economy which was that that we have these credit rating agencies the two big ones are Moody's and standard and Poor's and allow ours up almost until the day the you know the banks collapsed\nAnd the mortgage market collapsed these agencies that are supposed to rate the credit of the debt\nThey were the case basically giving AAA bond ratings do all of these mortgages that were worth less we now know that they were just you know I'm you know practically worthless because people were walking away from their homes and my point would be why why are we still\nRelying on these credit ratings agencies that they still dominate eighty percent of the market and they've got a terrible track record of related to that I'm not trying to scare people but did you know allow that to this day ten years after the prices because the prices and exactly ten years ago virtually said the day of today\nOr the or the federal government is continuing to provide one hundred percent tax payer guarantees

Paul and luckily he didn't get killed he was the man running against Eric Swalwell in California where the guy tried to stab him with a switch blade that was an operative\nSo yeah the left has already tried to kill multiple people in this country it states by God's Grace they haven't yet\n\nAnd they're just going to keep pushing the envelope though until it happens\nSo where do you think the left goes from here what does President Trump have to do about it or what do we have to do about it to try to stop it and then if you want to weigh in on the issue of yesterday that that we didn't get to

the last forty eight hours saying Republicans are fear mongering before the terms Rhode Island are trying to make their voter base afraid before the midterms\nLiterally folks dozens of headlines I'm

them show I can defeat them well here's what's going on right so right now I'm speaking to every Republican and conservative who is listening to me\nThis is what fighting back\nI I mean Donald Trump comes out of the scene three years ago and he fights Andy punches any punches any punches everyday\nEric Holder said yesterday that's nothing compared to things that Trump said Donald Trump has been fighting against the Democrats\nAnd that's why he's in the White House the Democrats are fighting back\nThat's all the Democrats are fighting back look\nThe Democrats under stand\nDonald Trump is in that show be\nAnd by the way both of those things are true Donald Trump isn't that she'll be\nAnd he did win\nI don't know when I hear Hillary and I hear all these other Democrats and I hear Eric

and if any Democrat tries to kick me I happened to be going to take my conceal carry classes we can I say bring it on but in in regards to the right being\nUpset about what Hillary and Mr holder said over the last couple of days yes it is what I'm gauging from this isn't so much that they're anybody's irate\nBut they do take some ... with the fact that they're that they're saying that uh\nThey they are somehow they previously some helping classy about the situation which they clearly habits I've never seen anybody on the right encourage us to go out and harassed people in public places are

isn't that she'll be\nSt Trump is now of course now Trump's Trump's not a civil guy he is and that she'll be and I just live on that for exactly and all I'm saying is the Democrats have reached that realization that they really need and that will be to even try to compete with them and and and\nOkay because my thought was I haven't seen any Republicans going in people at a restaurant eaters on a baseball field just shoot any Democrat so okay I can agree with\nYou know oh yeah yeah yeah no yeah thank you Tom I'm Glad you made that point no I'm not talking about the ... jobs on the far

match that works I don't have your hands [noise] yeah we're really excited to have you with us this morning so many people out there are suffering with respiratory issues and I my free to first began with a little bit of information about yourself breast because you have a very complementary and extensive curriculum Vijay\nShort so I have worked in a natural product industry for about twenty six years now and really my passion is education I really believe that you know we're people are smart enough to make their own decision in our job or my job is really getting good content Leighton information to them and so\nFly seasons is available right here healthy habits six to nine or seventh street has beautiful north central Phoenix\nYes indeed no question about it you know it's really important for us to focus on a breathing exercise helps and so one of the common results from taking a breather ...\nYou know what I'm there are a couple of ways to take this for some of the common results\nUm if someone was in a having allergic reaction if they were very symptomatic at the ... at the time or a lot of scientists discomfort\nSo they could take that and typically within about thirty minutes they'll begin to feel that kick in um okay our group is far greater results go I'm greater results are going to be let's say that we have\nWe [noise] pardon me we know that were coming into an allergy season will start that product the couple of months before and so what it's doing is bolstering the system in sort of\nGets raising her over baseline of health and so that hopefully what happens is during that allergy season or during that season where allergies or exacerbate that that we that\nIt's not quite as frequent\nIn so definitely you know depends on person to person but um this is for those that are looking for something that is a you know is that they don't have to go over the counter type thing this is again wait remedy for them so you know a couple other ingredients in there that are\nThat are I think worth mentioning are we hadn't that a lot of people probably come in for ... metal by itself and you guys are magical need yeah huh\nYeah I was thinking that we find it and all sorts of inflammatory type products but not all that ... that it's also in like a our product prostitutes\nSo what it's doing is the bolstering the system in sort of it's raising her over baseline of health and so that hopefully what happens is during that allergy season or during that season where allergies or exacerbate that that we that it's not quite as frequent\nAnd so it definitely you know depends on person to person but um this is for those that are looking for something that is a you know ... that they don't have to go over the counter type thing this has to generate remedy for them so you know a couple other ingredients in there that are\nThat are I think worth mentioning are we hadn't that a lot of people probably come in for ... metal by itself and you guys are magical major huh\nYeah I was thinking that oh we find it and all sorts of inflammatory type products but not all that ... that is also in like a our product frosty because it helps with the information but the prostate gland however ... that'll\nOr help that inflammatory response and again it goes back to that now that we're talking about so if you take nothing else from this today remember you have a mass so that explodes histamine onto the scene and so all these ingredients the medal for instance\nIt's keeping that it's ... mass solve so it's not having a hyper histamine response here last ingredient in there and the\nStrike it in stride what's his the Chinese or been used in\nTraditional Chinese medicine for you know thousands of years it's actually considered a comic\nUm which tonic means that it helps to own a fire our system because ultimately our body is still the greatest healer that we have\nRight these are all over that are really walking alongside in helping encourage our body to do what it's supposed to do that actually so Straggler supports respiratory uh overall respiratory function both upper respiratory and lower respiratory so great for him\nYou know 'cause I Know that will mention too that I think is a very important thing as far as the lifestyle go\nIf you guys um if if\nThe listeners if you do not Nettie pot and if you do not know how to spot is yeah this is a store you can talk to some of the employees there but I and daddy pot nasal irrigation ride an old are you ...\nA lifestyle I'm I'm a basically thing that we do and so ... what it does is it is irrigated so nasal passages and for instance myself\nActually living in the dry climate or Neddy pot first thing we wake up in the morning\nFor anything when you go to bed right before you go to that and to what it does is it clears out because\nIf you think about ... walks through our day and it's like we we're pair close right at the end of the day we take those clothes off a lot of times we'll throw 'em in the you know the dirty clothes or will seek them out because it has a lot of dust and things like that will think about\nThe same thing in our nasal passages and so what that Maddie hot it is doing this year I gave him the nasal passages so my encourage meant for and\nI don't know probably sell them for ten bucks I Would imagine but if you start an allergy formula if you start a an immune system formula\nPlease please pick up your Medi pot that will be a that will be worth its weight in gold and maybe one of the things that we've I've ever done for allergy\nChris thank you for that because tomorrow at our second half we have a specialist Dr Haan are talking about now deposit so what a great combination of the today show with immunity and breathe sex and of course tomorrow heartless are kind of learned more about some nutty pot use so thanks thanks to you Chris for bringing a\nGreat facts up to our listeners you know\nWhat else shall we talked about immunity and then can we take redux an immunity together\nYou definitely can't take breed back then\nIs doing this year I gave him the nasal passages so my encourage meant for and I don't know probably felt him for ten bucks I Would imagine but if you start analogy formula if you start a an immune system formula\nPlease please pick up your Neddy pot that will be a that will be worth its weight in gold than maybe one of the things that they've ever done for allergy\nChris thank you for that because tomorrow at our second half we have a specialist Dr Haan are talking about now deposit so what a great combination of the today show with immunity and breathe X and of course tomorrow our listeners can learn more about some nutty pot use so thanks thanks to you Chris for bringing a\nGreat facts up to our listeners you know\nLet us show we talked about immunity and then can we take redux an immunity together\nYou definitely can't take bring back the enemy entity together so they're coming at it from a little bit different vantage point in time and unit T. as we mentioned helps has ... helps that uh um\nThe micro floor of the micro biome that got help it also bolster our immune systems are white blood cells the ability to fight okay well this\nFocus more on that upper respiratory particularly sinus so they can be taken to gather or is it would be taken separately um can be taken as needed I Know some people for instance like for instance I travel quite a bit in so I'll\nTake low doses of the ah immunity on a regular basis but very low then when you feel like you're a system in getting a more compromise that the time to sort of up that same thing goes with the breed that you know have hit get it in your system raise that overall baseline of health\nAnd then when you do feel like something coming on or you know hey I'm going to go and mow the lawn and both the grass or it's going to beat Hollande is extra heavy today um according to the the weather station than those are times to really keep in in packing him build that up in an increase that those things\nAbout Chris we do appreciate that so when was the winner take both of these products together\nYou know what they can take both of those products to get I Would say uh if they were in a heavily or immune compromised situation so I'm definitely don't hesitate to take these to get that they won't hundred indicate you know we talk a lot about\n'em in our formulas we talk about the energy of ingredients well I think it's also important for for listeners to remember that that\nProduct can be synergistic in nature and so it's not\nIt's not it's not a bad thing to make products with another product and that goes for you know someone's taking one of our products will someone else's products or whatever they may be taking but you get the power state the some of the whole is greater than the parts right\nSo we know that the energy plays a very very important role for don't ever hesitate to take those together\nAwesome we really appreciate that right Chris\nWell you know for more information let's go to W. W. W. dot life seasons dot com life seasons dot com and all these products are available right here all of a all of life seasons formulas are right here in healthy habits so ah Chris I'm\nI'm you know

medicine standpoint how you could potentially look at it from me I'm from ... west during like herbal wisdom standpoint\nAnd then all the you can look at each of the ingredients and dealt down a

and ah it is all natural it's highly bio available it's a patented ingredient we have over Fifteen clinical studies on this it contains a sixty five or at least sixty five minerals a trace minerals very very small quantities\nAnd it works at the cellular level and that's the important thing and actually all of our products worked at the cellular level\nOr in a few years ago we had a a researcher in New York I Do a clinical study for is an eye on itself and what they did what they are what they performed was what we call the double blind placebo based study\nHow this actually means that half the group received a placebo mhm the other half the group receive the actual product and nobody knew who had what including the researchers right and at the end of this study here's what they found\nThat by the way the study was on skin herring nails okay they found a thirty three percent improvement in skin texture helped by a fourteen percent improvement inherit parents uh-huh and a hundred and forty two percent increase in they'll grow wow a\nA separate study actually show that that the the er an ingredient in I on a cell for women will stimulate college and growth how intelligent production and I actually increased college production by thirty percent now there's less products out there where you take college and\nAnd uh uh this is something where you can actually increase college and by not having to take college in because it's part of it is it helps the body to stimulate itself to to produce college and\nNow this is all great stuff but how in the world is at work well as I mentioned it's highly bio available and it has a sixty five minerals to trace minerals in it when you take it it doesn't it doesn't make it all the way through you to Jesse system\nIt was actually begins to work its way through a membrane in your system and will penetrate sell it to sell the cellular wall that gets into the cell\nOnce it's in that sell it goes towards the ... country of the cell because that's the part of the cell that creates energy and it will actually increase energy the energy level the mitochondria it increases while we called mitochondria metabolism by fifty percent okay study on that\nAnd then it said ... it's what we call the key later so it has the ability to attract heavy metals and toxins and it it will actually help to clean out the cell as well so uh detoxify itself and uh and\nSo how is the world is a work well with the veterans highly bio available it has a sixty five minerals and trace minerals in it when you take it it doesn't it doesn't make it all the way through you to Jesse system\nIt was actually begins to work its way through membranes in your system and will penetrate sell it to sell the cellular wall that gets into the cell\nOnce it's in the cell it goes towards the ... country of the cell because that's the part of the cell that creates energy and it will actually increase energy the energy level the mitochondria it increases what we called mitochondria metabolism but fifty percent okay one study on that\nAnd then it's a ... it's what we call the key later so it has the ability to attract heavy metals and toxins and it will actually help to clean out the cell as well so what did you talk supplies itself and up and it and then at the traits that energizes a so\nUh we and also protect yourself it doesn't always what is it protects against what we called like Haiti damage that's work too much glucose in our system causes what they call advanced like Asian and products\nAnd those start forming and go through our bloodstream and start damaging ourselves that's the important thing to remember damaging ourselves into this like Asia process is something that happens to everybody\nAnd it usually happens when you have a big meal your blood sugar levels after a meal go up and once that happens then like Asian is occurring we can reduce that process by fifty percent\nOkay and how much do you have to take a day\nTake one or two capsule okay um and so if you take one a capsule it's a it's a sixty days supplies take two capitals it's eight thirty days supply and it's selling at healthy habit\nFor Seventeen sixty five if you go and Amazon Amazon selling it for two dollars more Nineteen actually like Nineteen fifty nine okay so uh they do for the United states is just the retail so it's being sold at a at at healthy habit for listeners adjusted retail\nUm also it's a big big time any oxygen edible neutralized free radicals but but the bottom line is this is really the ultimate mhm as an anti aging product\nSo it's not just getting here and nails\nA is not just colleges but it's anti aging because it's helping to enhance ourselves and protect ourselves\nAnd it does that by penetrating energizing detoxify again protecting ourselves\nWhich I get a lot of questions from my customers to when they come in and they say Hi Jen how fast am I going to see the results so how long do you have to take it or when do you like you start seeing results rich\nWell the study that was done was a six week study okay so those results occurred after six weeks okay um and uh I've had people ask me how do I know what's working yeah uh well I Love your nails are growing faster and I and you know they didn't study how fast your hair grows but uh most people who are using and say oh my hair grows faster too\nSo uh that's a that's a that's really a one tell you because you were talking about a hundred and forty two percent increase it nailed growth you're going to be clipping nails more often yeah they're going to be growing out depending on what you want to do\nYeah I noticed that too and and and same with your hair I have to color it more often and throwing away fabulous

forty nine percent a hundred and forty two percent increase in they'll grow\nWell you've got a lot a lot of men wrote in here and that kind of like the tea it's an ... in here well that's a key in fact the mitochondria metabolism\nThe mitochondria of the cell is what they call the engine of the cell is what provides the energy and that's why this gravitate to the mitochondria when it gets to the mitochondria it's feeding that mitochondria and it's doing it with trace minerals and minerals and very very small quantities\nThis isn't isn't this isn't a mineral supplement the have to go through the justice system in hopes of it's going to get into your body\nThese are highly bio available basically what's in in the in the formula gets into yourself and so these are so small particles and there were ... electric charge that very very small\nWell that's great name for it I on itself right\nNow so I can nature and it protects and chances yourselves\nGrain itself so just say come on in and asked to look into the green by Cleveland polar right off the shelf for you or the red box we have to sell for a for guys and tell us more about that one\nWell a lot of studies ... it'll do the same thing is I ought to sell however we ever study on that that is a little bit different and that's on a a bone and muscle uh-huh uh we've we actually have a patent pending on that we have two patents that have been one patent pending on on this ingredient\nIn the ... depending on this one is for a muscle about study uh where we have shown a twenty percent increase in protein production and muscle and bone so it helps to repair it and and to do it has muscles and bill\nOkay good on this it's it's good for active people it's just it's kind of the sports nutrition area uh-huh uh because it never won the mitochondrial metabolism\nUh increase it energizes a shelter we're creating energy\nAnd and also the the college in uh are not just their skin but our entire body needs college and all

head I got a whole system set up for me and I still write it down on paper can you believe that so about six hundred million dollars is traded in bitcoin and we're back up again about half a billion but this morning the last twenty four hours about six hundred million\nDollars was traded or bought bought sold in bitcoin in the last twenty four hours\nAnd in the last um [noise]\nUm twelve hours or so\nYou know of course the it slows down because the most of it's done in age over there and a twelve to Fifteen hour time difference than us so that they got a different time zone so why were sleeping so we've got about twelve hour difference but in the last twelve hours it's really slow down about forty or forty forty eight million dollars we started the show now if I was you\nI'd get myself in a position because I was getting a lot of messages over the last day or two\nThat something's going to happen with coin I said yeah I Know it's going to happen something's going to happen but let's say but be liquid\nSo about six hundred million dollars is traded in bitcoin and we're back up again about half a billion but this morning the last twenty four hours about six hundred million dollars was traded or bought bought sold in bitcoin in the last twenty four hours\nAnd in the last um [noise] uh twelve hours or so\nYou know of course the it slows down because the most of it's done in age over there and a twelve to Fifteen hour time difference than us all that's they got a different time zones while we're sleeping so we've got about twelve hour difference but in the last twelve hours it's really slow down about forty or forty forty eight million dollars we started the show now if I was you know\nI'd get myself in a position because I was getting a lot of messages over the last day or two\nThat something's going to happen with coin I said yeah I Know it's going to happen something's gonna happen but let's say but be liquid and be ready to go after the show started about six hundred million let's look at it right now it looks like it's about twenty seven\nMillion twenty seven point three million traded so far in last Fifteen minutes can you believe that yeah I told you you just keep buying let's see we get that up to about fifty million dollars by the end of the show creating a pat let's get the path to pass a friend of mine ... and\nWe've known each other for several years path and we met when at the as I was telling her audience right we've got a big audience out here ... did you know that now you got a big audience in Arizona and around the country a couple of hundred thousand list and say\nIt is what it is yeah I make I Love scene in your in your conservative too right yep hallelujah thank you baby Jesus [laughter]\nNow [laughter] I was making fun of CNN and the other day and I got a buddy that works over there and I do CNN but such good is the best entertainment you can get for free right right but um I was telling him I said you know you guys what happened to your ratings you got like six hundred thousand listeners all day long\nHe goes yeah how much do you have I said well we have a couple of hundred thousand he was what\nI said yeah well you're he goes to your radio and I said well okay I got you got me there [laughter]\nOh we got about a third of their audience that's good now tell me\nWe we were at a meeting the other night right and you know when you're there are people just want me to buy stuff I Swear everywhere I go there like fly there in my back pocket trying to get my wallet\nAnd so you never ever did that to me but you went up and did something like well I got to buy some cars passed my friends went and bought some now tell me what that is right here this product\nThis product is ah called life and what it is it's a digestive enzyme because uh everybody needed for fat people [laughter] no it's not just for fat people it's for everybody everybody OK including children and pets really yes because we I'll eat cooked in processed foods\nOkay that's the problem the process correct because process is like plastic it's not made to break down right well\nYou tax your body trying to break the foods down got it so with this product called life it's a vegan base digestive enzyme and it's all plant based so even children older folks pets did what many can take okay so what's this supposed to do for you [noise]\nThis essentially helps you break your foods down that you eat which are cooked in process so they break it down from what we call the macro molecule\nTo them micro molecule which is the smallest molecule which allows you to absorb the nutrients\nFrom the foods that you eat that are cooked in processed\nOkay so we don't have a lot of times I Want to get to the point here so basically and I'm a fat guy and so as I was taking it so I said I'll Try the product bank right and as our you know in a I'm never skeptical I just try ... you know always believed the bass was tried out so and I was traveling to at the time to like it but as I was traveling so I take a couple of people\nReagan base digestive enzyme and it's all plant based so even children older folks pets did what many can take okay so what's this supposed to do for you [noise]\nThere's a sense they help to break your foods down that you eat which are cooked in process so they break it down from what we call the macro molecule\nTo them micro molecule which is the smallest molecule which allows you to absorb the nutrients\nFrom the foods that you eat that are cooked in processed\nOkay so we don't have a lot of times I Want to get to the point here so basically and I'm a fat guy and so as I was taking it so I said I've tried the product bank right and as our you know and ah I'm never skeptical I just try ... you know always believed the bass was tried out\nSo and I was traveling to at the time to like it but as I was traveling so I take a couple of pills\nEverytime I'd eat and what it does is it breaks down to more like liquid right right so that it can absorb the body can absorb the nutrients that is actually they're right and it gets rid of the rats but it's right\nYes because if you're not breaking down your food's what happens is then it turns into fat and you store that\nFat mhm so here's what happened to those of you listening out there I don't usually do little shows like this but the I'm Glad to have you on this past my friend\nAnd by the way you know the times were tough sometimes he prayed for us as always concerned the um and thank you so much for that well look at this my coat I

I mean we've been we've had the press rates for for a long time longtime\nMillennials don't millennials don't know six seven eight nine ten percent so they believe when they're going to buy than anything over three and a half is high\nAnd I think that there are deliberately psychologically anything over five becomes a cycle has psychological number it's the water cooler thing oh you just bought a house what was your interstate five and a quarter you gotta be kidding me\nI think there is something to that the millennials have ... you know the new home buyers\nAre used to for an hour in and around for or maybe even less maybe a little more but\nNow we're over four or five and higher and that's\nJust in a historical perspective it's actually really good really good\nHis ... right I mean historically but I don't think too many people are paying attention to historically anymore no they will ... it's a lesson list that you say I'm historically rates are what the only thing we know historically is\nUnder five for the last ten years historically for the last time you historically for the last ten years pretty much ... short term memory just a short short term what have you done for me lately and memory short term memory items or a neuro sees\nYou know speaking of ten years ago Rick oh seven oh wait oh nine ten eleven twelve Thirteen all of those was the height of our crisis the bottom of the market here bottom done eleven\nMany people had repercussions from it foreclosures short sales and they taught bankruptcies bankruptcies they tell you seven years so you can buy a house again people don't really realize you know in short sales and such and some in some cases foreclosures you can buy much sooner\nAnd so damn we were we were talking before the show how do people know they're ready to go and get back in\nWell I have a couple of people that are in that exact circumstance right now\nAnd both of them had a foreclosure in October of two thousand eleven there that are looking and I just told them you can't\nOh seven oh wait oh nine ten eleven twelve Thirteen all of those was the height of our crisis bottom of the market here bottom done eleven\nMany people had repercussions from it foreclosures short sales and they taught bankruptcies bankruptcies they tell you seven years so you can buy a house again people don't really realize you know insurance sales and such and some in some cases foreclosures you can buy much sooner\nAnd so again we were we were talking before the show how do people know if they're ready to go and get back in\n... well I have a couple of people that are in that exact circumstance right now\nBoth of them had a foreclosure in October of two thousand in Lebanon they're back out looking and I just told them you can't close until November because I Can't close them until after that seven years is that but\nThey that Fannie Mae also changed their guidelines while ago because yes without any extenuating circumstance is always a street seven years for a foreclosure however a couple of years ago they say well wait a minute\nIf you file bankruptcy and included your foreclosure in the bankruptcy you can use the bankruptcy waiting period which is four years\nSo you know it's Jordan's a timeline so there have been changes made you know F ha it's three years are the two years so depending on your circumstance a lot of people can buy when they don't think they can and they're they're they're afraid to ask\nAnd all they need to do is ask because every situation is different\nSo we used to date in terms of the clock starting is the discharge they that\nThis church yes for bankruptcy it to discharge date for a foreclosure it's the date that it was told that trustees auction and you can get an end county records I can look it up if it was in Maricopa County poet at the boom it sold October\nTwelfth two thousand nine eleven so I Know October thirteenth of the team\nIf they didn't have any extenuating circumstance my seven years is that\nHow do we know about extenuating circumstance I mean a lot of that kind of it's kind of slipped through the locks on\nYou know you have to prove it so basically most people keep their tax returns for seven years so let's suppose you know a lot of people especially in the construction industry in the tech industry got laid off lost her job\nSo they were making a hundred grand a year and a house payment of twenty four hundred and all of a sudden you know they get laid off and you remember for the longest time people couldn't find any work\nAnd when they did it was part time a lot less days that maybe they went down to thirty thousand forty thousand a year\nYou can afford to twenty four hundred dollar house payment I don't know I Would actually have to go back and show the taxes where they were making let's say a hundred thousand a year then we would show where they got laid off because we deserve condition of employment if companies doing business\nAnd you can get their tax returns and you can eat\nA huge decline in income so that would be an extenuating\nSays so it's one of these things where you could actually you being the lender you could actually prove the extenuating circumstances like\nIf it wasn't already allocated as oh this is an extenuating circumstance you can actually go in and check the taxes check the financial whenever you do and get a little bit and invest the clock would be over and they could actually come back in and try to take advantage of rising interest rates and\nYou know a market that might see some opportunities near term for buyers\nAnd shorter waiting period so each circumstance is different from I suggest\nA hundred thousand a year then we would show where they got laid off because we deserve condition of employment if he's still in business and get their tax returns and you can eat a huge decline in income so that would be an extenuating\nSays so it's one of these things where you could actually you being the lender you could actually prove the extenuating circumstance like yeah if it wasn't already allocated as oh this is an extenuating circumstances you can actually go in and check the taxes check the financial whenever you do\nAnd get a little bit and invest the clock would be over and they could actually come back in and try to take advantage of rising interest rates and you know a market that might see some opportunities near term for buyers\nRight in shorter waiting period so each circumstance is different so my suggestion if you went through something like that you know call me let's talk about it and even if you're not ready right this moment like the one that I'm going to be that's looking now\nThey've started looking last year I pulled it up because they thought it was over seven years ago but it took the banking next year and a half to foreclose on all the way the addition earlier\nAnd again if you guys have questions about whether or not you can qualify today and get back in the home buying process being direct line of suburban\nSix to six six sixty seven twenty six ... two six ... six sixty seven twenty\nEight well it's been a wild ride for rates over the past couple of weeks where where are we today\nOkay so we always is they sales praise the two eighty on F. ha they were at a rate of five percent of the navy or five point eight one two total payment including taxes insurance mortgage insurance Eighteen forty two thirty\nEight did you say if ha ha\nOkay and that's a clue them I I Can't do everything right yet that's everything so that's mortgage insurance taxes regular insurance change away yes\nEighteen forty two yeah\nWhat's the VA\n... hanging in there five percent within a year or five point three or four to six Seventeen twenty two Ninety two\nOh Seventeen twenty okay no money down we can try to get a cellar to pay costs you know they're the market is a little bit more of a fifty fifty market would you say Rick ... is that fair\nYeah yeah yeah I mean but the good properties the good ones I think it's still a seller's market anything less than really good really good lots of really good location really good shape buyers\nMark or so in general you know give or take how about a conventional the\nConventional twenty percent down really good credit you're looking at a rate of five point to a is an NPR oh five point three six or total in fourteen twenty four forty four\nOkay fourteen twenty four and this is a two hundred and eighty thousand dollar loan amount that correct but I only ... percent I don't know\nHow to mount will be two hundred and twenty four than twenty four percent down mhm\nTwenty four five and a quarter of your payment is fourteen\nTwenty or we're\nGoing to say we're gonna we're going to do some apartment or a comparison\nHere in a little bit so just remember that number fourteen twenty four how about for investors DNA where are we are is anybody going to be lining up with a water cooler with this race in the ... role plays\nWell they might because we're still in the five in my life but we're with good credit twenty percent down where at five point seven five\nEight verify point eight one neat\nYou know if I'd point to fix or total in fourteen twenty four forty four\nOkay fourteen twenty four and this is the two hundred and eight thousand dollar loan amount that correct that ... percent that doesn't happen amount will be two hundred and twenty fourth new twenty four are only ... percent down mhm who twenty four five\nAnd a quarter of your payment is ...\n... when the war we're going to say we're gonna we're going to do some apartment or\nA comparison\nHere in a little bit just remember that number fourteen twenty four how about for investors DNA where are we are is anybody going to be lining up at the water cooler with this race in drug rolled please\nWell then my because we're still in the five by but we're with good credit twenty percent down with five point seven five\nEight terrified when he when he\n... where in Ninety four Seventy\nHey we're going fourteen Ninety five and that's ... percent down\nPhoenix ranks and the top one third of US cities for the most luxury apartment construction nobody out years cranes on every corner\nThat I Am yes that in Tempe I guess Las Vegas in St Louis lead the country in the ... a hundred percent of new complexes are deemed luxury and those two cities\nAre okay so how about this so we're looking at rats\nGilbert and this is we're going to do a sampling\nThe average apartment in Gilbert fourteen twenty fourteen twenty three point five percent from last year fourteen torn your average apartment and Gilbert\nAverage apartment Peoria fourteen hundred that's up for point two percent which is the highest on our list Chandler Thirteen sixteen surprise Thirteen sixty Scottsdale Thirteen hundred and if it's just kind of stale Thirteen hundred it's interesting Scott's those lower but you know they have\nA lot of older apartments in Scottsdale to yeah they don't have a an ... that they're building the new luxury stopped for sure most of the apartment to Scott's are built in the late eighties you know even in the seventies can't compete with the with the auction court um outlets of the new\nThere you go [laughter] Tempe eleven hundred and sixty bucks basically it's got that you're lucky to have a water heater\nThey let let alone will knock scored an ox\nChord I Know I Love it interesting number eleven sixty in Tempe that's that's a lot of college kids obviously that's a three point five percent I mean all of these rates are about average of three to four percent across the town Phoenix comes in at a thousand fifty that's average\nFor a two bedroom apartment in Phoenix a thousand fifty that's up to point six percent\nSo here's the interesting thing metro Phoenix you need to earn approximately wrecked\nThey have a lot of older apartments in Scottsdale to yeah they don't have a ... they're building the new luxury thought for sure most of the apartment in Scott's are built in the late eighties you know even in the seventies can't compete with the with the auction court um outlets of the new\nMayor you go [laughter] Tempe eleven hundred and sixty bucks basically it's got that you're lucky to have a water heater\nThey let let alone will knock scored an ox scored I Know a lot of\nInteresting number eleventh sixty in Tempe that's that's a lot of college kids obviously that's a three point five percent I mean all of these rates are about average of three to four percent across the town the nicks who comes in it or a thousand fifty that average\nFor a two bedroom apartment in Phoenix a thousand fifty it's up to point six percent\nSo here's the interesting thing metro Phoenix you need to earn approximately wrecked Nineteen dollars and fifty cents an hour to afford a decent two bedroom apartment a lot\nAnd you have to earn a lot more for the valleys newer apartment\nWell especially in the middle of a rate minimum wages what Fifteen ten it's ten right it's Fifteen didn't work at Amazon but I don't know about the\nI think there is a the propositions to raise the minimum wage you're over a period of time I don't exactly know where it is right now but yeah so the point is for similar numbers if we can get you into a home\nYou would reap the benefits of the tax advantages you get any appreciation which of course we can't guarantee\nWell let's say about this for a second if I say is it five percent that's three and a half percent down payment is Eighteen forty two\nSo it's a significantly higher but joining me to come up with three and a half percent down right and when you factor in what's back during the ... you will get to write off some mortgage interest that is true me a hundred percent financing it Seventeen twenty two per month no money down zero zero the conventional\nFourteen twenty four fourteen twenty four it's so basically one wonders for forty percent down two hundred and eighty bucks to break even of the average rental it throughout the city\nThat's what you have to do to get the average rental but you have to put twenty percent down pay five and a quarter percent interest good credit and its fourteen twenty four but here's the other part of that Rick ... you know and I realize you can get roommates\nAnd stuff but we are talking about a two bedroom apartment versus the house most of the people that are good but I also have a family it's very tough to deal with families in two bedroom apartment you can do it but I mean there's living needs as well better to be factored in\n... and just uh I don't mean to break your train of thought the Dow is now down five hundred points it went from two hundred points to doubt drives five hundred point it's now broke into two hundred moving day average\nIn the Dow right you know you said that that was something to look I think that's a technical or ... if you want to see some buyers start coming back into the stock market the break of the two hundred day moving average I think is a point what you just did so it'd be interesting to see what happens is that close there's talk\nA little bit of ... let's talk about this as to how this relates to what we do in real estate you have a stock market that that's a psychotic that down Thirteen hundred points in two days you have interest rates that are up significantly in the mid five\nMid low five and you have a photo one k.'s and or pensions and everything that are getting a obliterated\nSo what does this do this puts a little bit of a stall on the market psychology and the other things that go along with it so that's why we're starting to see a little bit of him at Torrey days on market are going to grow a little bit I Believe this is going to turn into a buyer's type of market I Believe that the the froth that I talked about last week\nYou remember the beer and now that I had I remember the frog it's his front they usually call it head but I chose to call it froth\nAverage I think is a point what you just did so that it'll be interesting to see what happens with the quote let me talk a little bit of ...\nLet's talk about this as to how this relates to what we do in real estate you have a stock market that that's a psychotic that down Thirteen hundred points in two days you have interest rates that are up significantly in the mid five mid low five and you have for one k.'s and or pensions and everything that are getting a obliterated [noise]\nSo what does this do is put a little bit of a stall on the market psychology and the other things go along with it\nSo that's why we're starting to see a little bit of a majority days on market are going to grow a little bit I Believe this is going to turn into a buyer's type of market I Believe that the the froth that I talked about last week you remember the beer and\nNow that I remember the frog idiots his front they usually call it head but yet chose to call it froth thank you for doing that yeah\nSo I Believe that that the froth is going to shrink and I believe that people are going to start lowering prices to where the beer is\nTo get it I Do okay so I'm sellers be where keep your hands on the pulse of this market because they do believe we are in for a little bit of a slowdown if this all\nContinue but here's the gas prices up the market to fucking we're going to be down five percent two days but your your house value is essentially going to remain but in check for now it's going to but the market that a lot more of the places that are hiring people they're not going to stop\nYou know all the growth that's happening here just count the cranes in your neighborhood I'm not saying that the more of the world is falling off upright if I was telling you is that the housing market this could lead to people putting money into real estate\nThe housing market that the market itself as volatile as the stock market these days it never used to be that way\nWe're going to talk about some distress sales and we came across\nWe gotta talk about respect we got our less things stay with us flock to come on the real

this comes from this was one of the things that was it was disgusting or the Lacey Act if you received an odd package and um\nThere were a couple of hundred and make sure I guess this this correctly um policy Mike and wrote about this as well\nSo here's an example\nSay you own a small business it that you important fish from another country and and you distribute it to restaurants one day you're expecting your usual shipment arrives but not in court cardboard boxes the way it usually does this time it's in plastic\nAnd it turns out that the originated in country bands the shipment of fish and plastic so you've just violated a foreign law or the Lacey Act the least there by the way is what they tried to get gives been good heart with\nYou remember that Gibson guitar\nThere are because this book this book is really good I'm\nBack here for instance\nUh this comes from this was one of the things that was it was disgusting or the Lacey Act if you received an odd package and um\nThere were a couple of hundred and make sure I guess this this correctly um policy Mike and wrote about this as well\nSo here's an example\nSay you own a small business that you important fish from another country

the originated in country bands the shipment of fish and plastic so you've just violated a foreign law or the Lacey Act the least hit by the way is what they tried to get give them good heart with\nYou remember that gives him guitar which completely fine when it was importing rose would Fort Trump boards and they argument under the previous administration was that they were in violation of the ... the act which they were not and it was trying to peg than with a number of felonies\nThis was when I first heard about this book because it was like this sounds like they're really trying to drum up something and that's when I started looking into just aches and like how the hell is that a felony and I went in and started looking at the\nUm so and so anyway you own a small business you're importing says it's safe to seafood restaurant so you got 'em your shipment and it comes it comes in plastic instead of cardboard boxes so that that violated foreign law for other country of origin\nSo as a result that's the Lacey Act under that act it's unlawful to import export cell\nAcquire a purchase fish wildlife are plants that are taken possession transported are sold in violation of us are Indian law in interstate commerce involving fish wildlife or plant taken possessed are sold in violation of state or foreign law that the actual writing this actually happened to three Americans seafood dealers asked\nA that had no prior records\nThey were this was back in two thousand and one they were trying to pack them for importing lobster tails that were the wrong size and packaged and clear past plastic bags rather than cardboard boxes and they sent them to um I in total or ten years in prison\nBy the way do you know if you take a fake that day\nOkay so yeah this was the Supreme Court actually had to go back in ... end of the statute\nIt was so vague so for instance say that you would you would never do because we're all responsible people\nWould say that you know you got two tickets to you know playoffs or something and you you if you want to be able to take the day off work because the seats are amazing you know you're not going to be able to get the chance again so you called and you say you're sick\nUm but apparently that is described as quote a scheme or artifice to fraud and the ... the company of their quote intangible right to your honest services which can be arguably arguably a federal crime\nAnd the statute which show unbelievably vague that a couple of years ago the Supreme Court had to get involved and actually mended to apply only to bribes or kickback because it was so and that's not the only one that that statute that's insanely vague like that\nOr it was so ambiguous even Justice Scalia who was a of still on the bench when this was when they were a remedy in this said that it criminalizes equipped criminalizes a salaried employees funding and sick to go to a ball game\nThere was um for instance back in Nineteen Ninety six here's another one there was a well known automobile racer Bobby answer he got lost in the woods essentially he got convicted of a federal crime he was sentenced to six months in prison because he got lost in a blizzard in Colorado for two days watched while snowmobile and ...\nAnd he was guilty of quote unlawful operation of a snowmobile within a national forest wilderness area and he didn't\nUnbelievably vague that a couple of years ago the Supreme Court had to get involved and actually mended to apply only to bribes or kickback\nBecause it was so and that's not the only one that that statute that's insanely vague like that\nOr it was so ambiguous even Justice Scalia who was a of still on the bench when this was when they were a remedy in this said that it criminalizes equipped criminalizes a salaried employees funding and sick to go to a ball game\nThere was um for instance back in Nineteen Ninety six here's another one there was a well known automobile racer Bobby answer he got lost in the woods essentially he got convicted of a federal crime he was sentenced to six months in prison because he got lost and a blizzard in Colorado for two days watched while snowmobile and ...\nAnd he was guilty of quote unlawful operation of a snowmobile within a national forest wilderness area and he didn't know who was in the wilderness area because he had gotten lost in the middle of the flipping blizzard that the felony\nDo you understand what I'm saying how the ... the classification of felonies has been expanded\nTo the point where you can't even keep track of it anymore\nWhich was the basis beyond you know that book you could even get into the media like for instance James Rosen a friend of mine who were there James rides and who reports from New York Times and James Rosen who reports for Fox stupid progressive don't understand the different than they can play them and think that the same person whenever this comes up\nSo if you did was under the espionage in censorship act\nWhich is because it's it's vague\nUm in terms of\nHow it can be enforced and this was when the Obama administration and the holder department of justice went after Eric Holder because he had several contact within the state department and he wrote a story and it wasn't actually like a scoop or anything it was just about how North Korea was testing nuclear or whatever\nAnd she wrote a story about it and ... and it loosely pertains to national security and so as a result the administration didn't like it so they persecuted him under the espionage and censorship act because he was protecting his tours and so\nUm they said that he violated espionage laws and it even judgment call a ton of its end quote this was the first time that the federal government has moved to this level of taking ordinary reasonable traditional lawful reporter skilled in claiming they constitute criminal behavior\nNow do you want to know something else that can be considered\nA felony because we're talking about how you know here you have ... who's at the White House and he's talking to the president and one of the things he's discussing this criminal justice which this administration has done more than the previous on criminal justice and I hope that I we need to do more for instance\nAnd I'm giving you an example of how so many ridiculous things are classified as felonies now I think felonies should be limited to certain awful crime because now everything's a damn felony and when you think of forfeiture of your rights\nFelony I mean you're talking about one of the things that constitutes that ... that that classification is if you know the the penalty is improvement over a year or more well then that's a forfeiture right here for him but that's her so for instance check this out\nIf you um switch jobs or you leave your old pure place of employment if you tell your friends and family to not use them that could be a phony\nNot even kidding Computer Fraud and abuse law\nThat's actually happened before in two thousand Brett McDaniel surf sixteen months in prison because he alerted customers of of his old company tornado development about software problem that was never effect he explained it to companies email system had a flaw that could allow an attacker to gain access to users email records\nProsecutors argue that he had damage their system wired magazine said he was quote ... that the jailing was a that they wrongly jailed a security whistle blower [noise]\nPlus a vacation is if you know the the penalty is improvement over a year or more well then that's a forfeiture right ... so for instance check this out\nIf you um switch jobs or you leave your old your place of employment if you tell your friends and family to not use them that could be a felony\nNot even getting Computer Fraud and abuse law\nThat's actually happened before\nA into thousand Breton again they'll start sixteen months in prison because he alerted customers of his old company tornado development about software problem that was never fixed he explained it to companies email system had a flaw that could allow an attacker to gain access to users email records\nProsecutors argue that he had damaged their system wired magazine said he was quote ... that the jailing was uh uh they wrongly jailed a security whistle blower [noise]\nI mean this is crazy I can sit here and go on and on and on and on and on and on\nThere are so many ways that\nLittle Biddy things I mean it isn't over criminalization epidemic\nAnd this is why we need criminal justice reform\nLike for instance did you know Twenty one USC section for sixty one a ... a subsection three eighty one a point one seven one do you make it a crime that sells turkey him as ham turkey or with the words turkey and ham and different font\nThere's a whole crime there's a whole Twitter account out there called a crime a day that lists all the insane felonies\nThis is what I'm Talking about when I say we just we got to have criminal justice reform\nBecause and this is just one example by the way I could get into\nYou know I could we could talk about in prison that we could talk about white collar crimes we could talk about drug why we could get into a whole bunch of it but I'm just giving you this overview oh do you know\nI'm at sixteen USC ... section ... uh five fifty one subsection to sixty one point sixteen the make it a crime to wash official faucet if it's not a fish washing faucet international for us\nThe ... the department of justice back in the eighties attempted to count the total number of federal crimes and they came yeah yeah or for instance did you know it's a felony Eighteen us the section Eighteen sixty five subsection seven point nine sixty a free make it a federal crime to harass a golfer at any national park in Washington DC\nHere's what about this said that you want to go on vacation how many people

different events et cetera et cetera on my own time and time just 'cause I wanted to help out\nUm and\nAnd all of these different events\nI never saw anybody get out of hand\nNow I'm not saying that there weren't some ... people there\nThose people would be put in line by the other people\nAnd I know at one event in Clayton, Missouri\nThere was a guy who I think he was a troll\nBecause I I I just don't\nI I just can't imagine you would want to hurt a movement with would you agree so this is why I think he was a troll but he came out and and plus he was he was but he was just trying to start stuff in St ignorant things and and he was run off by everyone else there\nIs only the only thing I ever saw\nNever saw any burning buildings people getting punched in the face nobody did anything like that they were but all these individuals I I saw a I Will never forget and Quincy, Illinois\nAnd there was at one event\nI mean there were women and families and they'd bring lawn chairs and portable cooler full of bottled water and juice boxes and they'd have string cheese for the kids and cheese it's and that's what they brought right they didn't dress up in black and hit people's cars with that\nAnd I remember at one of the one of the events in Quincy they brought out and that was when a bronco bomber was in Illinois speaking of something\nAnd all these people are just very peacefully protest in have marched out very theatrically to swap\nA all they swapped numbers and they stood in front of like these and um there were there was an elderly woman who was just went with an American flag help hobbling along on a cane\nAnd they had ... people out there I thought it was funny it's just peaceful principle protest\nAnd there was a point to it\nAnd and it was respectful it was about what you know there's not there's no such thing as you know too big to fail away we don't need to be paying everybody's mortgage we do need a government healthcare et cetera\nAnd it was about raising that awareness I went to a number of town hall is when I talk about when videos began to go viral and when the classification of a tracker\nAnd I remember at one of the one of the events in Quincy they brought out and that was when a bronco bomber was in Illinois speaking at something\nAnd all these people are just very peacefully protest in have marched out very theatrically to

thing as you know too big to fail away we don't need to be paying everybody's mortgage we don't need government healthcare et cetera\nAnd it was about raising that awareness I went to a number of town halls when I talk about when videos began to go viral and when the classification of a tracker was first invented for campaigns since back in two thousand and two thousand nine\nI went to all of these different town hall the first town hall that kick it all off and really wet twin town halls became a thing and it went viral was Claire McCaskill town hall that was in South that in St Louis and I was there I live not far away\nAnd I went there and it was full of people she was going to show but she ended up not showing us is by the way the reason why she bars video cameras from her town halls now because of this because of the one we were out there was a standing room only\nI was actually sitting in the corner of the room on the floor just taking notes and taking videos and getting pictures and documenting everything for what I Would later do and\nYou had a bunch of people and yet they were indignant and yet there were concerned and they were passionate but they were always civil and they were always respectful even if their voices were raised they would always say senator or a man or anything like that the Claire McCaskill ended up not showing that it didn't stop people\nFrom speaking their minds to her representative there and you had veterans that showed a fender college kids and and and young mothers and you know old men who were who were themselves veterans and you know all this stuff\nSo many different types of people were there and they were there were people who are passionate doctors spoke nurses so particularly when it concerned health care I'll never forget one very informed doctor who worked at Barnes a the big hospital there in St Louis\nSpoke out about the dangers of government run health care and how it affects her job to be able to provide quality care for patients and et cetera et cetera\nAnd it was very well thought it was so thoughtful and informed and everyone was doubling polite and when their time was up there quietly finished and they allow the next person to speak everyone stood in a nice orderly line there were no riots there was nothing like that\nAnd then there was another town hall that I attended in South county a and this was that Russ Carnahan he was a member of the Carnahan family in Missouri right his he was ... he was district it out it was in third district he used to be my right\nNow when I Lived in St Louis or he was my rap until they combine the third with the first district there and then ended up having lacy clay which is the joke\nA he's a guy who plays a guy took a painting with cops stress to pigs and a hung up at the Capitol do winter west ... Russ Carnahan town hall and I think just as it was an oval or Melville in St Louis to St Louis county and ah they bust and a bunch of agitator Z\nAnd a buck than all these people and they were very hostile Carnahan people I watched as they screamed at in the face and I took video of it\nThis guy just a younger guy screened uh right by the side of the face of this old guy who was wearing a World War two veteran hat\n... I don't believe me go you all go on the Internet and you look it up there's photos and video that exist they were absolutely jak wagon ignorant people that were looking for a fight and meanwhile\nThe third but the first district there and then ended up having lacy clay which is the joke\nI he's the guy who lazy plays a guy who took a painting with cops stress to pigs and a hung up at the capital so winter west ... Russ Carnahan town hall and I think this was it was an overall or Melville in St Louis to St Louis county and ah they bust and a bunch of agitator Z\nAnd a bus in all these people and they were very hostile Carnahan people I watched as they screamed at in the face and I took video of it\nThis guy this a younger guy screamed right by the side of the face of this old guy who was wearing a World War two veteran hat\n... I don't believe me go yoga on the Internet you look it up there's photos and video that exist they were absolutely jak wagon ignorant people that were looking for a fight and meanwhile the tea partiers that were there were very calm cool and collected and everyone waited in line you know they listen to it was specifically on health care\nI remember seeing him of a of a black man I'm Out front\nWho are selling Tea Party merchandise and I saw him before it a number of different things and it's I just I it was because I had seen him so much but what struck out to me and I the reason I bring up a skin color is because it matters to progress as an because at factors into what happened to him [noise] ah\nThe I saw him previously at an event where tea partiers were protesting bronco bomb and he was selling Obama merchandise he was a capitalist he would just tell the merchandise to the the ... the biggest script that he would he thought was going to show up\nThat's what he would pack up and sell right size seen about Obama events previously selling Obama buttons and Obama shirts and hats and Obama cups et cetera well this time he was known Tea Party stuff Tea Party like the beads go\nAh flags and hats and shirts and all that\nAnd his name is kind of planning and um as I had a ... I had a hit with Greta Van Susteren it was one of my very first Fox has\nAnd I was leaving the town hall and my husband and I were walking through the parking lot and I heard all hell breaks loose behind me\nAnd I turned around and that's right when I saw one of the dude who was there with Carnahan take glad need to the ground they were yelling racial slurs because they thought he is a black man was a conservative\nI was there and I saw it and there were a lot of progressive that we're trying to spend the crap and I will I Will get righteously indignant with you until you just at the hell down because I was going to start with my own damn I don't you man playing this crap to me liars I was there and I saw it with my own eyes\nAnd I'd never seen anything like that I was very nervous inside the gymnasium they turned off the air conditioning\nThey shut all the doors perfectly I think to make it hot I honestly think to this day that they were trying to make something happen there um and there are people were so overly aggressive it was almost like it was on purpose in theatrical like they really wanted to start something\nI'm I've never seen anything like that that was my first experience with that and I turned around and I had never seen violence at a political event\nAnd I watch this discussion glad needed a ground watched as he he they've tumbled he kicked them um and then everyone started running over and my husband was like this is going to get out of hand fast we ... we need to move because we had to go all the way back downtown for hit\nAnd I was I'm On the phone with Greta producers at the time one of her producers hated me so bad and she she than me from coming on her show one of her producers was really mean\nI'm because she found out another producer had asked anyway um but she's so I called her producers ... on my way either and I was like all he'll just broke out at this\nIt was on purpose in theatrical like they really wanted to start something\nI'm I've never seen anything like that that was my first experience with that and I turned around and I had never seen violence at a political event\nAnd I watch the discussion glad needed

... at the event at this ... at the Carnahan of that and I was telling them and that's how the news broke I've broken on credit show\nAnd we ended up getting her video and all of that stuff and it was the first thing that I'd ever seen that was that those were the people who were angry for all these comparison then there was a piece in the Washington Post about that they were trying to compare people and the Tea Party to the mob\nIt is a speech is offensive\nAbsolutely false ridiculous accusation it is a lie I watched a woman on Fox last night regurgitate that be a story that James cleaver tried to push through and he said back in two thousand and ten and tea partiers are rallying outside of the capital\nAnd they were allowed and they had their signs it wasn't nothing like what you saw but the Supreme Court business\nBut ... was ... he tried to say I think they were mental cleaver he was he tried to assert that the tea partier spit on him and Manuel cleaver said that do somebody had said on him except there were thousands of cameras there\nTons of angles and all of those cameras proved him wrong\nMy late friend and mentor Andrew Breitbart even offered I think it was like a ten thousand dollar reward for approve of it and what was even crazier Jesse Jackson junior was walking right behind cleaver recording it on his phone recording everything on his phone\nAnd he everybody demanded he released his footage and he outright refused and then all the other individuals that were there that had that were right there when it happened everybody had found that there were multiple angles there was a video of all the different angles put out show to absolutely never happened\nTake advantage of this rare opportunity come by or officers on camera back road just east of forty of

Dell wants the radio show and today we're talking about how to harness your fear to drive success and make the changes in life that will allow you to create the wealth and passive income that you need to live the lifestyle that you desire and of course we believe\nThat real estate is the best vehicle to do that and\nSo we talk a lot about that and it's not that we love a real estate it's that real estate is the investment that gives us the types of tax breaks I'm the type of runway that we need do talks about it as a train you know that that the stock market goes up and down\nIn a moment based on the news based on emotion\nReal estate is like a train in the distance you can see it coming you can take a vase of action and get off the tracks before it runs you over\nAnd I I just just love when he talks about that it's been several several shows using that analogy and it's a it's so true we can see things happening and they don't they don't happen in a moment's notice they don't happen in a day\nAnd even when the economy changes we don't have all our tenants move out you know one of the great things about real estate as we all like to have a roof over our head and that that allows us to to maintain occupancy in our apartment center single family rentals or through all\nMarket cycles it but when we talk about fear Jillian now as a mentor you you whole people's hand figuratively through through this transformational process and for me it's the most rewarding thing I've ever done in my life\nIs to stand by someone side as they fundamentally change their life and\nAre able to achieve goals that they thought were out of reach for\nAn allergy and it's a it's so true we can see things happening and they don't they don't happen in a moment's notice they don't happen in a day and even when the economy changes we don't have all our tenants move out you know one of the great things about real estate as we all like to have a roof over our head\nAnd that that allows us to to maintain occupancy in our apartment center single family rentals or through all\nMarket cycles it but when we talk about fear Jillian now as a mentor you you hold people's hand figuratively through through this transformational process and for me it's the most rewarding thing I've ever done in my life\nIs to stand by someone side as they fundamentally change their life\nAre able to achieve goals that they thought were out of reach for them [noise] so we talked about how we develop those\nParadigms in life the things that we believe in in your experience what are the things that people here are growing up that create a belief system that makes it hard for them to get away from\nWorking for a company you know the idea that somebody expects are going to work for the same company you know their whole life for most of their life\nIs should be gone but yet it seems to still be a strong paradigm that the getting that good education is going to get you that job and you're going to be able to move up and invest in a four one K.\nThen move it to a self directed IRA and invest in the stock market and retire and I think that's that's still the paradigm I still see articles telling millennials this is what they should do\nAnd where does that come from what people tell you stories\nWhere is this highly ingrained paradigm coming from in our society\nI think that the paradigm comes from your upbringing and how you were raised I'm I was a very very fortunate to individual and the sense that I grew up in a very loving household and I also have the experience of being raised with my grandparents as well so I had to generation telling me what I should do in order to\nCheck off all the boxes that I'm supposed to as an adult you know the education was very important in our household so when it's a college and then there was always the conversation about\nHow it's so great when somebody has a job for their entire life but they just hit their tenure at at this company or whatever the case may be and there is a sense of accomplishment pride you get accolades for that so obviously growing up in a household like that you want to or do you want to be just like that you're emulating the people that you were raised by\nThat becomes a situation where I wanted all of those things now don't get me wrong my parents did you not invest in real estate um they they support me and my decisions to invest in real estate and I think that they are very intrigued um they still also have the fear which is kind of comical because they have seen it first hand\nHow wonderful it is and how much it's changed my life\nUm but it also becomes a situation to where you know they\nAre fearful because they still here things and they can sample in two thousand nine when the real estate market crash they're fearful and the sons but what if the real estate market cautious again and\nYou're invested in real estate what's gonna happen and I just kind of mild because it becomes a situation where you know I'm not investing in the stock market where everything is just gone with a couple of little ... than a couple of flashing lights all my money has disappeared from one computer to another it's a situation where I own real estate and I have rental properties and\nNobody is going to do a mass exodus out of my home because they need a place to live and I've done it right I fall adult now and clean and functional and providing people with safe affordable living so they're going to continue to stay in my tenants so therefore I Will continue to be able to make money no matter what\nBut it also becomes a situation to where you know they\nAre fearful because they still here things and they can sample in two thousand nine when the real estate market crash they're fearful and the sons but what if the real estate market cautious again and you're invested in real estate what's gonna happen and I just kind of smile because it becomes a situation where\nYou know I'm not investing in the stock market where everything is just gone with a couple of little text and a couple of flashing lights all my money has disappeared from one computer to another it's a situation where I own real estate and I have rental properties and\nNobody is going to do a mass exodus out of my home because they need a place to live and I've done it right I fall adult math and clean and functional and providing people with state for for double living so they're going to continue to stay in my tenants so therefore I Will continue to be able to make money no matter what the market throws out me um\nI also think that a lot of times people are so scared because they always have the horror stories of you know their uncles neighbors friends brother had a rental property wants Twenty years ago and it was a nightmare and all of these things went wrong and yadda yadda yadda we all heard the story every single one of us can account for that\nAnd it's just not true that guy that you heard this story about the hand information just didn't do it correctly he might have on it ... a rental property but he didn't own it correctly or he didn't buy it correctly or whatever the case may be\nBut I think that the biggest push for change lifestyles are the reason why so many people are\nAble to leave their comfort zones of what it is that they're supposed to be doing out per societal norms or adds further upbringing is there's it's a whole group of like minded people that want a better life as Adele likes to say the only thing standing in the way of a great life is a good life\nSo it's really remarkable to have a huge group of support system family a group as lifestyle does because\nHas the same goals and not to be successful and for other people to be successful as well you know I'm the abundance mentality on successes not apply to become the type of thinking that it able to propel you to the next level\nIt was actually kind of funny because I was having a conversation with my mother the other day and she was talking about her um four one K. and she just you know would put money into her four oh one K. and she never looked at it as so many Americans do because they can't touch it been told their retirement age\nThough she hasn't looked at it and years and years and years and she was looking at it and she was so happy but it had gone up and\n... and it did it went up so like I said it it it worked well for her but it also became a situation where I started having the conversation with her if she would have invested whatever she put into her four oh one K. into real estate that number would be ten fold higher\nBut I think that so many Americans are trapped in the thought process but\nOh yeah it went up\nAnd once again she never talked to she never paid attention to it so it's a situation where if it went up substantially or if it dropped or if it went up a little but she's just happy that it didn't go down and how sad is that you know you work your entire life and save and save and save and\nYou're just hoping that it's going to be a little bit more than you put in\nYeah it went up\nAnd once again she never talked to she never paid attention to it so it's a situation where if it went up to ... or drop or if it went up a little bit she's just happy that it didn't go down and that is that you know you work your entire life\nAnd save and save and save and you're just hoping that it's going to be a little bit more than you put it\nAnd that's not a way to live a life and that's definitely not a way to plan for your future so it was cool nickel and like I said my parents are very responsible and successful individuals in their own right but it was just kind of comical\nHow much is that\nAnd they are really surprised\nTo see how much money they actually paying taxes for one case of the same talk about your mom be excited that her four one K. balance went up well she's been dollar cost averaging into it for how many years\nSo it's going to go up even if the market is is flat and if she takes a hit and that's what's happened you know with your mom she's taken four or five significant hits over her career\nTo that four one K. and and you ... you know if she had invested in a different investment vehicle something that\nHad a longer you know track so she could see what was coming she would have a lot more money and be a lot more prepared for retirement [noise] if you have a question for us give us a call at eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven\nDealing can you talk a little bit now about\nSome of the steps that people take\nTo overcome their fear to get out of these paradigms and to learn something new you know I I Love something that you say all the time you say you know especially because a lot of people we need are highly educated and they're very very successful in their careers and you'll make the comment of get over yourself and get educated can you talk a little bit about that yeah\nSo for me going into lifestyles and learning the entire process of real estate investing\nKind of became a no brainer after the fact I Know that sounds silly but I Do believe skeptical at heart and I'm a glass of having the kind of guy I can take you done any rabbit hole of gloom and doom\nAnd I'm also very risk adverse so I understand I fundamentally understand where people that are coming from but you invest employ one cave and think but\nReal estate is a scary thing because you know they watch those in Spain HDTV channels where like we're going to flip this house and\nThat's how you make money we're going to take that has done to the studs and you're going to get off of work and you're going to come here and here to stay here told them in the morning busting out drywall you know that's what people think of when they think of real estate investing and it can be further from the truth [noise]\nSo I decided to take it upon myself to go down my rabbit hole of gloom and doom and try to find the loop hole and lines do the limited path I wanted to see where there there was something wrong or\nThe gotcha I'm always looking for the gotcha so it became very apparent me pretty\nKind of guy can take you done any rabbit hole of gloom and doom\nAnd I'm also very risk adverse so I understand I fundamentally understand where people that are coming from but do you invest before one k.'s and think that\nReal estate is a scary thing because you know they watch those in Spain HDTV channels where it's like we're going to flip this house and\nThat's how you make money we're going to take the house down to the studs and you're going to get off of work and you're going to come here and you're gonna stay here to help them in the morning busting out drywall you know that's what people think of when they think of real estate investing and it couldn't be further from the truth\nSo I decided to take it upon myself to go down my rabbit hole of gloom and doom and try to find the loop hole and lifestyles unlimited path I wanted to see where there there was something wrong or how the gotcha I'm always looking for the gotcha\nSo it became very apparent to me pretty early on that there really wasn't a gotcha because I'm In control I'm the one that makes these decisions and in regards to me being risk averse this was a perfect fit because\nAs we talked about earlier if you're investing in a four O. one K. you literally put money into that account your own money and if you're lucky you have an employer that matches it and then it just you pretend it's not there that is the best course of action because what's gonna happen as it goes up it goes down it goes up it goes down\nHopefully it continues to go up but more than likely it's going to go down\nThat actually the gamble real estate investing isn't a gamble real estate investing is a tried and true process and it can be proved if you just educate yourself you know a lot of times people come in and they want to talk to me about their fears and their concerns and they're always looking for the gotcha and\nThe answer is just be informed just be prepared for those situations in opposite lifestyles moments or does it prepare people for situation\nUm a lot of times people are scared about things like well how do I deal with this situation if a tenant needs me chew the toilets clogged and they can't do anything about it and something happened ... Palmer\nI I'm not going to tell you to go get a masters in plumbing just\nCall a plumber that's the logical step um but at the situation to where you're correctly educated and I'm prepared for real estate investing you change that toilet out when you bought the house so the likelihood the statistical possibility of that toilet going south on yeah it's pretty slim\nSo you know we if you do everything right from the beginning\nThat how you are able to be successful in real estate investing and you know every single month that when you're trying it pays the rent you're going to pay that mortgage and you have money in your pocket because that's the path of stream of income that coming through\nSo in regards to the tax benefits to it it's a lifesaver you know you're able to take advantage of tax benefits and invite off that you wouldn't otherwise be able to if you were in a real estate investor and then so when you're looking at that lying on your tax return saying\nHow much did you pay in taxes you're just going to start with one that number down because of your a deduction in real estate so\nIt it is to me it's I at the risk adverse individual I feel that this this significantly less was more ... I ... I'm Sorry I feel that this is a significantly lower risk for an investment\nThan just giving you money to an employer but give your money to a four one K. management company and these people just go in and invest in whatever and it goes up and it goes down so\nI I think that this is actually the more conservative way of investing in your future opposed to the conventional paradigms which kind of ironic but it is true this is actually the safer way\nAnd and it is because you know again there's those those um miss out there about real estate in\nYou can get that line on your tax returns saying how much did you pay and that you're just going to start with one that number down because of your a deduction in real estate so\nIt it it to me it ... at the risk adverse individual I feel that this is significantly less with more ... I I I I feel that this is a significantly lower risk for an investment\nThan just getting your money to an employer but give your money to a four one K. management company and these people just go in and invest in whatever and it goes up and it goes down so\nI I think that this is actually the more conservative way of investing in your future opposed to the conventional paradigms which is kind of ironic but it's true that is actually the safer way\nYeah and and it is because you know again there's those those um miss out there about real estate investing and and uh that have to be overcome you thinking about the fears that people have\nOne fear that people have about change is that when I go to change I'm being asked to suspend\nA logic and being asked to suspend the the knowledge that I think that I have and and the point that I think you just made that we're not asking anyone to suspend a logic to ... to to ignore the knowledge that they have acquired over life we're asking them actually to go back to some fundamental core beliefs about\nPeople and how the world works and when we come back from this break we'll talk more about that and and we'll get some more ah encourage men and tips on harnessing\nYour fear to drive six and this is ...

know I I've been trying to get Mickey to tell you guys exactly how long she's been in the business and you know without you know wanting to date herself\nYou know I said over Thirty years [laughter]

I Know which a lot of people get really really really\nJust caught up with the pace of life through the holidays in the holidays coming in you know my favorite holiday is right around the corner\nAnd when we come into the holidays with the fed meeting two more times to raise interest rates what has taken place is that actually refinances have increased one point seven percent just within this month\nAnd when you look closely at kind of what the let's see time versus money concept is technology doesn't care about that\nWe can use technology as a tool but we can't use technology in order to really get into the core matters of time versus money\nAnd you know these are some topics that aren't necessarily you know\nGoing to be covered within this particular special episode of the future of finance but that's kind of where this is heading organically\nIs time versus money and it's not to create a sense of urgency for you to pick up the phone like I said before this is purely educational for you to decide when you want to pick up the phone or when it's going to be the most important time\nFor you to pick up the phone and have a conversation with Mickey\nI think at that time is now and I don't ever think of anything ever waste of time\nSo you may be feeling like well you know I'm really not quite ready to buy into the spring or maybe in the summer but I've had so many people over the years that have come to me and we just\nTalked about what it's going to look like and get that comfort level as yeah wow this is what the payments going to be the this is where I'd like to be then you get into that area of which went hope\nAnd then I bring into reality but it's not big because it's better to know how to turn into going blind so I always say the time and now\nAnd you know that's a good point Mickey and that you know that's you know\nTired of it you know brings me to the fact that you know you you guys have heard Mickey speak directly to you about you know wanting a south facing driveway you know regarding you know the state of Colorado and I just want to make this very clear to you guys we have literally chosen\nCertain markets to really really assist with in the influx of what's coming in and out of the state of Colorado number one first and foremost from Colorado to Arizona and we all know the traveling back and forth of the snow bird\nThe reason why that's important is that a lot of people do not understand that December is the most busiest time of the year with in real estate\nA lot of real estate agents don't even know that and they kind of just set their whole calendar up to say okay well I'm just going to take this next two to three weeks off\nWhile I can assure you with Keller Williams international and then also how gateway mortgage group had to position themselves\nAnd make the camera and as a host with myself Christopher bread well on the future of finance this December is going to be by far how it's going to have more closings within the state of Colorado just because I have foresight within technology and\n[noise] the reason why that's important is that a lot of people do not understand that December is the most busiest time of the year within real estate\nA lot of real estate agents don't even know that and they kind of just set their whole calendar up to say okay well I'm just going to take this next two to three weeks off\nWhile I can assure you with Keller Williams international and then also how gateway mortgage group had to position themselves\nAnd make the camera and as a host with myself Christopher bread well on the future of finance\nThis December is going to be by far\nHow it's going to have more closings within the state of Colorado just because I have foresight within technology and what killer Williams has decided to do as far as purchasing certain bits and pieces of technology on the back end of even Zillow\nOkay in order and I all you have to do is watch\nYou know you know basically watch the news even on that topic that I'm bringing up to you within talk radio is that\nZillow stock is down there's there's certain companies out there\nOkay that or even technology companies themselves that are being very very pressured and whether in because of disruptive technology\nAnd you know that's why I'm bringing the real human being to you giving you the access of eight four four yes gate the way to your future so you actually have the opportunity to pick up the phone right now\nAnd speak directly to Mickey camera and and this is an opportunity for you guys that knocked it I'll always be there\nYou know and I just I Want to be honest with you so you don't get discouraged if you wait until December to pick up the phone and you can't even get a hold of Mickey camera and\nOh well well well well I have a strong team you will always be able to get a hold of me well\nThat's what I Want to hear because I care more about you as the listener than anything that has to do with necessarily even the future of finance and because of the history of the future of finance you know that to be a fact\nI mean when it comes down to rhino philosophy when it comes down to home life balance\nTo be honest with you this is just a tool in order for me to connect you with somebody who really cares and you know Mickey\nThat brings us to a real for main topic which is compassion within the financial in banking industry which those two words because of my history within the business as far as being an asset manager\nDealing with the secondary market you know working for some of the largest banks in the United states and you know just\nCompassion and financial banking industry\nAltogether it just like how did those words even how does that mash how if you whether as being a woman of compassion\nOh you're kidding me it's not easy not every day they had that in ... structure red tape Adeline\nCorporate sometimes when you said that can make someone feel like they can't um uh-huh\nAs far as being an asset manager dealing with the secondary market you know working for some of the largest banks in the United states and you know\nJust compassion and financial banking industry\nAltogether it just like how do those words even how does that match how if you whether as being a woman of compassion\nOh you're kidding me it's not easy not every day there's the intent structure red tape Babylon\nCorporate sometime my new shed that can make someone feel like they can't um uh-huh\nAnd that is what I feel important to let everyone know that you can on baseball\nHotdog apple pie and owning your own home\nIt's a big part of being in this country it's your opportunity and sometimes it may be not right now but it will be and that is really a big piece of mine moved to gateway gateway is very passionate about empowering family\nAnd they have a very strong work ethic and environment and to me a big part of mortgage is accountability and integrity\nSomething they're outside of our control sometimes things get a little high plains on an inspection or value or whatever but I'm not going to turn Tam and hide I'm right there up front and center with you negotiate one\nI just you know as you're talking and I'm hearing that there's a real human being that is\nOn mass media that's physically reaching the airwaves as a host on the future of finance it gives me chills right now because you know and the fact that you can call one\nEight four four yes gate the way to your future is absolute\n... it just blows me away you guys ... and I'll tell you why\nIt really comes down to\nBasically three things you know and you know actually I'm not going to even tell you why I'm doing all that Mickey tell you why\nWhat that experience is going to be like when you actually pick up the phone and you know before we go there\nI Want to just you know think every single every single one of my listeners [laughter] you know should you know to be sitting and listening closely why and I know why\nSingle one of my listeners [laughter] you know to you know to be sitting and listening closely why and I know why\nAs far as with homeownership if you're already a homeowner and you're looking for a second you know a second property if you're looking to purchase property in Arizona if you're living in Arizona and you're looking to purchase property in Colorado\nI mean we're really connecting the dots you guys because you know what we have to rally together\nWith him not rhino philosophy\nRight otherwise guess what happens next spring nobody knows

particular city you don't really know what's going to happen because guess what our youth is our future so it's up to the millennials for us to educate them enough to be able to take us into the next decades\nAnd you know that's what we're here for that's why it's called the future of financial future is now exactly and you know it's our young voters as you would say Mickey and you know it's like I\nI just you know my natural instinct\nJust as a human being and as a man is to be extremely selfish and I can tell you guys right now with Mickey Cameron as my host on the future of finance\nIf so

Holt markets crashed it's ugly the people in in power get blamed the gear teams come out and it's just not a good time for anybody\nSo they constantly are giving up the stance that have no real basis in reality and you kind of say well but you know if that's what kind of keeps this whole thing going you know why do I care well\nThe reason that you should care is because it allows people if they believe the numbers and not just allows them actually kind of direct them to making bad decisions so for example last friday we had the jobless number come out and people talks about how well you know yeah we didn't create as many jobs as we expected\nBut when you look at the raw provisions for the month before it was still okay and now we have the lowest unemployment rate we've had in this country for fifty years back to Nineteen sixty nine or whatever it was\nWell the thing is that true okay and we're going to get into why it's not true but what it means is that when people hear that and they think holy cow the economy is firing on all cylinders therefore I'm going to put more money at risk and the stock market\nThey're buying in it the wrong time the key to making money at anything in life as buying low in selling hot\nBuying stocks at the all time high of the market is unlikely to yield the returns that people are expecting\nAnd that's the thing stocks are incredibly expensive right now it doesn't matter what metric you want to look at stocks are basically they've been may be more expensive once or twice in all of us history\nSo you say well why would I buy them now\nWill people buy them now because they have this misperception that the economy is doing well and everyone you hear okay tells you it's doing well it it doesn't matter even on the left they'll tell you what we're doing well but it's not dividing the\nThe um results of the economy fairly or we could even do better or whatever it is but people don't argue with the fundamental fact that well but the economy is growing unemployment's down\nBut again those things are incredibly misleading statistics\nAnd the leads people to do the wrong thing to get into the market after the big moves have happened to the upside and again if you look at worst stocks are priced right now history suggests that the stock market's going to return after inflation\nThe world has taken over you think about you we have a gross domestic product will the world basically has a rural product of how much it produces and if I remember correctly the world's producing something on the order of a trillion dollars worth of stuff\nNow I'm going to argue that that's not a great measure and there's a lot of games that get played with that number but what's just kind of take that on faith that that's the right number\nWe will stipulate that number as it were okay well if you then look at how much that the world has it's generally somewhere around I think three to three and a half times that number so whatever it is it's three and a half times more is what the total debt is so it's in the three hundred kind of trillion dollar range three to three fifty so\nYou'd sit there and say okay you have all this debt out there what's going to keep this thing going if people stop borrowing money and they start paying back the money they do well in fact nothing\nOkay because the only reason there's been anything that looks like growth pretty much anywhere is the fact that people are borrowing huge sums of money I mean the United states last year for actually for the last couple of decades\nFor us to be able to grow the economy a dollar we have to borrow about three dollars so again as long as there is confidence and people are willing to borrow and people are willing to lend we can continue to get something that kind of looks like gross\nBut besides the feds issues which I'm going to get into\nIt's why I'm so concerned about the election this fall\nAgain not a political statement you can think Trump is the devil and you can think he's got on earth it makes no difference to me okay I Do not have a dog in that fight but if the Democrats take the house and I don't know that they will or will not and again I don't have a dog in the fight one way or another\nI'm going to tell you that is not going to be good for market confidence because if you think the last couple of weeks with Brett Kavanaugh were kind of vicious\nWay do you what happens when when ... when Donald Trump is center stage okay\nBecause I I don't know I Would guess that if you went back thirty six years into Trump's chew might find something slightly unsavory um that or at least that you can construed that way\nAnd and again you may think that all that stuff should come out and you may think it should all be forgotten in the past and you may have blind faith that he's telling the truth and a blind faith that no matter what he does he's a liar\nAgain it makes no difference is it going to be good for the country's confidence confidence in our economy has confidence in our market if it is two years of sheer division well every piece of this man's life it's investigated and not just his life\nEvery person who knows Brett Kavanaugh is probably not out of the woods yet and again you may think this is all great and what should happen in this divine justice that's all fine but I understand it's going to have a tremendous impact on business and to be Frank if I'm the party out of power I'm not sure\nSome things slightly unsavory um that or at least that you could ... truth that way and and again you may think that all that stuff should come out and you may think it should all be forgotten in the past and you may have blind faith that he's telling the truth and blind faith that no matter what he does he's a liar\nAgain it makes no difference is it going to be good for the country's confidence confidence in our economy of confidence in our market if it is two years of sheer division well every piece of this man's life has investigated and not just his life\nEvery person who knows Brett Kavanaugh's probably out of the woods yet and again you may think this is all great and what should happen and it's divine justice that's all fine but understand is going to have a tremendous impact on business\nAnd to be Frank if I'm the party out of power I'm not sure I'm Upset by that\nBecause if you crash this economy you will romp in the next election you will take every lover of power that's out there now again I Am not attributing that as a motive to anybody do not misunderstand but they've had worse things happen to them\nAnd you know don't throw me into that briar patch as it were so I look at it and say what is it kinda road\nConfidence one of them is money getting more expensive too is obviously the markets starting to go down housing has been slowing and many of the larger cities I was actually we had a student and the other day with a mortgage broker for going on Thirty years\nAnd his statements ... flat out was the recession is already started he said I've been through this movie before he says there's two big brokers kinda nationally that he mentioned don't remember the names offhand but both of them I was laid off you know around two hundred people like one of them last friday laid off a hundred and eighty people the other one was like two hundred and fifty\nAnd you said these are the things that you see happening when housing is basically grinding to a halt\nNow can they do things can they go to lunch money down can they keep this thing go and maybe for a little while\nSure but at some point we know this all has to stop and when it stops is going to be really really ugly and again if I'm the party out of power or even the party in power and I'm not in love with the policies with this president it'd be really nice to be able to blame all this stuff on him when it went south\nAnd and as I've often said\nWe give way too much credit to presidents for things when they look like they're going well we give way too much blame when things aren't going well because at the end that day the president can only do so much now but it doesn't matter it's all the perception\nAnd so if we can hang a whole bunch of stuff on you know with the ever the other party is in power then that's going to be good for us so when I look at that I see a couple of different\nI mean most people believe that the Republicans hold the Senate again maybe they will maybe they won't I have no real insight into this but I actually read some announces today
