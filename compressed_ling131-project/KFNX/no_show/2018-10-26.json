going to put it on the uh Mexico side of the word Mexico ... ... they're watching these people walk with her they're not even\nEnforcing their own migration or immigration laws right now just rather not even force you know if they were they would stop them at the border into the exact same thing without their land and have a free pass as far as I'm concerned but\nNo partner with us at all in this\nOh God no no Mexico is the biggest enemy of the United states wanted them for sure other than China and nobody people always think Mexico's our friend they're not our friend but we've all been down there at the resorts and whatnot but the hierarchy the elite of Mexico they hate America\nAnd they are really in league with with with Hillary in rock Obama and the Democratic party\nAnd even if

a country\nFor a long time that the VA has not delivered the kind of health care that you might expect I Know that some of you veterans have had fantastic healthcare from the VA unfortunately we've had too many veterans who literally died while waiting in line\nMetaphorical line that is being put on a weightless somewhere and that's just not not right well I Believe that's being corrected by a change in the law and buy a new\nV. secretary the secretary Robert Wilkie who's been nice enough to join his before secretary well could welcome back to the program\nWe'll take your large thank you for having\nIs there a new development in the form of an online portal that's actually going to make veterans' health care veteran please tell my audience about that\nYes we'll be launching in the next few weeks of the first\nPhase of a V. A. dot Gov which will be a place for veterans to get information on everything from health care to education benefits\nYou know the last time I believe we talked about the having hundreds of eight hundred numbers\nHundreds of of links to different websites let that made the process of actually getting in to the system almost unbearable so this is the first of a a two pronged\nAssault that we will be making on that the the second is what is going on right up there\nIn the Pacific northwest in Washington state and later in Alaska where we will be a\nBeta testing the electronic health record\nWhich will for the first time connect a veteran from the time that he had heard is that military processing center as a young recruit the time he walks into and to be a net will revolutionize the way we provide cover\nWhy don't why do you think it's taken so long to get to that when you would think that the people working within the ... system would have said we wish we had the same kinds of capabilities that you know the average a retail company out there in America has right\n[noise] well I think laws and it's something that you you talked about for years I mean you've made your living on the preaching free market ideas and appreciate preaching the notion that\n... in Washington state and later in Alaska where we will be a beta testing the electronic health record\nWhich will for the first time connect a veteran from the time that he had heard is that military processing center as a young recruit the time he walks into into VA and that will revolutionize the way we provide cover\nWhy don't why do you think it's taken so long to get to that when you would think that the people working within the ... system would have said we wish we had the same kinds of capabilities that you know the average a retail company out there in America\nRight well I think laws and it's something that you\nYou talked about for years I mean you've made your living on on the preaching free market ideas and appreciate preaching the notion that uh if we're going to have official government is that is possible it has to be closest to the people that government serves and a BA has been a\nTypical government institution there are hundreds of thousands of good people who joined VA because they want to serve veterans but they've been held back by\nUh nineteenth century prophecies and regulations and a beautiful thing about\nWhere we are today is that we've got a president who does not care about what went on in the past I mean he ah I think somebody else was called the great disruptor but he certainly has when it comes to the the system and he's he's not going to tolerate business as\nWell and so secretary well OK I'm sure that some people are going to hear there's a great computers that's going to cost a bundle of money but at the end of the day does it have the potential not only to deliver great care which is what we care most about but also potentially to be more efficient and less costly than the current system\nIt it does it does in the sense that it will provide us rapid scheduling\nIt will and this is the most important part and the president will be announcing reforms in the state of the union in January this will be the basis for the opening of that ad but sure when it comes to veterans choice and health care and\nThat's the ability of the veteran not to be tied to a system that maybe ... miles and miles\nAway from his home it's going to be a system that in many cases almost all will allow that veteran to choose whether or not it's better for him to get care closer to home\nThan in the VA center I'm that's what's truly revolutionary about what's coming and the beauty of that is that we do have a consensus from the Congress they've given me as the secretary the\nAuthority to create this new system the president does on board and you know it's right in line with with our philosophy of government\nA government that serves and his in his singularly designed to stir up those people we are mandated to help\nSecretary well can you tell me that is because I imagine that most of the pushback from any of these kinds of changes like along vets to access private medical care from the system that serves the rest of us I've had veterans tell me themselves that they had good results by going that way when the VA has been willing to pay for it\nBut I Would imagine it also has the potential for some VA employees to lose their jobs you have all of a sudden\nYou know all the local hospital the local civilian hospital is doing a lot more of one kind of procedure another and it's not being done at the VA center that means jobs and typically the unions have fought against that have you managed to conquer that part of the problem\nDoes on board and you know it's right in line with with our philosophy of government a government that serves and is it is singularly designed to stir up those people and we are mandated to help\nWill secretary well can you tell me that's because I imagine that most of the pushback from any of these kinds of changes like along vets to access private medical care from the system that

at the VA center that means jobs and typically the unions have fought against that have you managed to conquer that part of the problem\nRight well the president has been very clear about um the delegation ship with with arguments and he has said\nThat there is no Iraq and there is no prerogative for unions or any other group federal employees in general um with Matt prerogative comes in between the veterans' health\nAnd we have\nSaid that clearly the president does move of course we are now hung up in the courts but that's to be expected a you know we we're we're blessed with a lot of dedicated work but um we are very clear\nThat a union members who are medical professionals in the day if they're going to stand up or they have to disclose their time to take care of patients not spending as as some do actually many\nSome nurses doctors spend a hundred percent of their time doing your work uh that's not what are the veterans expect that's not what the public expects and that's certainly not with the uh the president of the United states demands\nLet me ask you about something this is another issue that came up and is now than you'll Bedford Forrest I remember that name from both you know junior high school and high school there was a portrait of that man who was a Confederate general uh he but he also became the KKK is first figurehead Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd one of your employees a deputy director of the euro VA offices small disadvantage business utilization had that portrait up in his office but he said I didn't know that he was connected to the KKK and so they've taken this down\nYou know on one hand I understand why somebody who knows history that well might be offended\nBy on the other hand it just seems like this is where where scrubbing every bit of American history and most of our history is filled with people who would not be politically correct by today's standards do we end up scrubbing all of the history and I wanted to get your take on on on the fact that there was a little controversy about this\nRight well let me tell you how I was arrested now first of all I did not place or this individual or\nPictures of George Washington and what have you lived in his office right as soon as someone complained he took it out so there's\nThere's no complaint with the impact he he removed it um and that's what he did write I'm I'll tell you how I'll address\nThis um when I was a for confirmation a there are several members of Congress who are demanding\nThat Mr Lincoln's words from his second inauguration of grace at bay where he says that we shall take care of those who have borne the battle and his widow in order to be taken down from the VA\nReally um I actually have those ... yes and I actually have those words in my office an office that was once occupied by it\nAn individual or the George Washington or what have you lived in Salt as soon as someone complains you took it so there's\nThere's no complying with the impact you remove the ... and that's what you did write I'm I'll tell you how\nThis um when I was a confirmation or there are several members of Congress who are demanding\nThat Mr Lincoln's words from his second inauguration um Green Bay where he says that we shall take care of those who have borne the battle and his widow and wants to be taken down from the\nReally um I actually have those I actually have those words in my office that was once occupied by ... ... when he ran the Veterans Administration um I have\nIt's been all in the news this is what they want to get Trump for for the non existent Russian collusion or right they are section three of the federal criminal code but but James\nBuckingham couldn't make it to section three never got there oh it's crazy there's no way we can go after the sanctuary cities yeah it took me six seconds on Google\nOn Google defined accessory after the facts\nWilling in you pointed out and I remember the fight we're Arizona's said if you're not going to enforce the immigration laws we Arizona will under a good governor and the Obama administration fought it tooth and nail and at least in the gorge one and they want under the premise that only the federal government can enforce immigration laws\nAnd you would think that that that would make it very clear about the other thing that occurred to me you're a lawyer as you point out in the column and as we pointed out before\nBut isn't there an equal protection issue here I don't suppose the rest of us who are legal citizens the United states could bring a massive ah you know a a case against a class action suit saying we're being denied equal treatment under the law\nYou have a certain class of people get one kind of treatment under the law and American citizens get lesser treatment believer and\nActually a really great idea of one of the grounds on which it's illegal to ... to discriminate as place of birth and nationality I'm In this case I mean the assumption was discriminating against people who weren't your fellow citizens no it's just the exact opposite\nOn people who are not our fellow citizens who commit crimes are being treated better by prosecutors are less likely to be charged with charges at all or charged with ah the maximum crime they can be charged with in order to to\nHere I don't suppose the rest of us who are legal citizens the United states

keep the criminals here\nWell and and you know that there are at least a couple of places in America they are going to have a vote on this on November the six to get rid of sanctuary status and I think the voters are going to vote to get rid of it but how do we convince say the New York times which things but it's terrible that Jeff Sessions would go to one of his deputies and say would you please research says\nAnd then and then the the New York times is an outrage from the deputy comes back and says no I couldn't find anything like that and the law and you find it in six seconds on Google\nIt it's it's pretty amazing but there is an element on the left a\n... it's been with us for a long time ago just hate America whether they were um you know selling selling or giving nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union rooting for the Soviet Union over our own country um to today where they are rooting for the caravan come across they just want to destroy the country\nNow I think most elected Democrats\nAren't that hateful\nAren't driven by a passion to destroy our country but there are certainly bucks out by those people and and the position of most elected Democrats is a number one ah the the the masses of third world are\nPouring into our country oh look they vote for the Democrats were all four of them and number two it's just gotten to the point that whatever Trump is for their against it's worth mentioning that not very long ago Harry Reid Dianne Feinstein\nEven Iraq Obama were against this influx of illegal immigrants bringing their path olive jeez I'm their poverty their medical problems to our country when we have our own people with\nPath olive trees poverty and health problems that we need to take care of\nAnd and in fact we've been running that soundbite I mean it's it's amazing that the New York times is forgotten the great ...

and\nI told you that we're going to talk about the uh the bombs are weird expected to talk to a crime Maloney but apparently he's unavailable tonight let me share just a bit of what he had to say about what is coming and whether or not this is the October surprise that we see so frequently\nFrom a primarily from the left although I looked at looked at the history\nAnd uh I had to remind myself to run a few October surprises from the Republican side as well but what he wrote was the discovery of multiple explosive devices addressed a prominent Democrats across the U.S today has the potential to be the kind of October surprise\nThey could up in the mid term elections and maybe even affect the balance of power William Casey campaign manager\nFor Ronald Reagan's Nineteen eighty presidential

Reagan's Nineteen eighty presidential campaign instead of course coined the term in the eighties although there were some\nEarlier than that the concept of an eleventh hour revelation or event that could scramble everything in the month before Americans go to the polls predates the term previous October surprises\nHave happened twenty sixteen Access Hollywood\nTwenty twelve the Romney forty seven percent\nI didn't agree with Romney about much but I agreed with him about that what he was talking about was the forty seven percent of Americans who burn a paycheck and pay zero federal income taxes\nAnd he was criticized for saying those people you know who pay no federal income taxes don't care whether income taxes go up or down in two thousand eight the market crash you know sex the representative Mark Foley scandal\nWhich you feel remember fully was a Republican heat sensing text messages that were kind of creepy but other than that he didn't break the law and he very quickly resigned his position gotten his car and drove back to Florida as I recall\nIn two thousand for the Osama bin Laden video and oh three of the California recall election and in two thousand a really odd one because apparently even if you fully admit that you've done something wrong\nThe surprise was the October surprise in two thousand was George Bush had a drunk driving ticket when he was in college and he was I think twenty eight years old and he didn't try to make any excuses he said yeah I did\nI did get a drunk driving ticket and you know what he decided to do right after that probably the most adorable thing that anybody with a drunk driving ticket could do is say I'm going to quit drinking\nAnd he quit drinking period for the rest of his life and this was a long time later obviously he was running for president in two thousand and he said I'm going to quit I quit drinking right after that realized I was drinking too much and decided to quit the boost\nNow you'd almost think that that kind of answer would get you more plaudits that it would critics but no that was one of the October surprise in any case is this the October surprise\nI guess it will depend on who it ends up is responsible for those bombs if it turns out to be somebody with a Muslim surname\nI have a feeling that's only going to amp up the president's supporters if it turns out that it's a right wing not somebody who is allied with the conservatives then you're going to get the Democrats doing something really\nOdd and really two faced\nBecause they will say well if this was a conservative than the blame goes to Trump\n... which is a bit akin to saying well if it's a lefty who commits an assassination or commits a terrible crime then the blame falls on all left days and you understand there is a double standard in the media about that you can cite example after example where\nThe media will say well just because this happened involving one left wing or doesn't mean you blame everyone\nAnd they especially do that if you have an act of terrorism carried out by somebody who's a follower of Islam and they say you can't blame all of Islam for the actions of one member of Islam\nBut boy if one person with a gun commits a crime that all gun owners are suspect that's the double standard that we routinely see from the left wing media and believe me\nNo matter who they catch and I expect they will catch somebody fairly soon involved with these bombs or devices most some of them were not active bombs at all they were just devices made to look like bombs no matter who it is\nI think the CNN and MSNBC and the New York times the Washington Post will try to find a way to blame it on President Trump let's go to mark and mark welcome to the Lars Larson show what's on your mind and I\nLive in less than ... years love you\nThis happened involving one left wing or doesn't mean you blame everyone and they especially do that if you have an act of terrorism carried out

try to find a way to blame it on President Trump let's go to mark and mark welcome to the Lars Larson show what's on your mind and I\nLive in less than ... years love ya thank you very much shrouded\nNo problem I got I got I got a question is becoming a cross my mind for a while with all the rhetoric cholesterol and out inciting violence and want to check them while they're down yet I go on and on call and say they ever make you wander it's been\nMaking me wonder are they are they ... is the ocean\nFor another civil war I mean there is a poet people from other countries\nYou remember the Democrats lost the last several wore a\nAnd and the Republicans won and thank goodness for that uh but but they are they're pushing for another and by the way they'll tell you all those weren't the Democrats have today Oh yes they are and we can watch a couple of the national Susan movies and you'll see the evidence and I have to give great credit to diminish for being able to do that\nBut do they want another confrontation I think they think that's the only way to remove this president and here's the case I'd make they demanded in September of twenty sixteen\nDonald Trump you have to say that you will accept the results of the election now that demand came from none other than Hillary Clinton\nAnd yet at the same time reporters weren't asking Hillary because they didn't think it was possible Hillary if the election doesn't go your way will you accept the results of the election they never asked the question and why because nobody nobody in the mainstream media thought it was going to go that way I did I thought it was going to go to Donald Trump\nAnd so did a lot of other people and obviously enough Americans voted for him that he won the presidency\nAnd they went nuts on the night of November the twenty sixteen they said we can't accept this result and I've always been proud that I live in a country where there's a peaceful transition of power or it has been up till now\nAnd we said you have an election and no matter whether you like the results are not\nYou accept the new president and if a sitting president gets beat after four years you accept the new president and if a president served two terms I think at this point Donald Trump is the odds on favorite to serve a second term and that election is still two years away but they went nuts and they immediately that night and the next morning began saying\nWe have to impeach him and I don't know if you remember this or not\nBut in December in December and January the Democrats vowed we will never even let him take off as we will\nFind a legal way or some other way to prevent him from even taking the oath of office and then we got past the inauguration\nAnd they burned a few cars the left dead you know all the pink hat wearing ladies burned cars and ... you know ... in the streets\nAnd I didn't do any good and then they said well we'll get him some other way we'll have him investigator for years on a baseless allegation that somehow he colluded with the Russians were going to get ... I guess some of the results of that from the mall or investigation as soon as we get past the election\nThe odds on favorite to serve a second term and that election is still two years away but they went nuts and they immediately that night and the next morning began saying we have to impeach him and I don't know if you remember this or not\nBut in the Senate in December and January the Democrats vowed we will never even let him take off as we will find a legal way or some other way to prevent him from even taking the oath of office and then we got past the inauguration\nAnd they burned a few cars the left did\nYou know all the pink hat wearing ladies burned cars and you know write it in the streets\nAnd that didn't do any good and then they said well we'll get him some other way we'll have him investigated for years on a baseless allegation that somehow he colluded with the Russians\nWere going to get ... I guess some of the results of that from the mall or investigation as soon as we get past the elections and I think the only reason they're not leaking out right now although that could be the last minute October surprise ... hold it until after the election if you hear stuff starts to leak before the election from the mall or investigation\nThis will prove that point that a lot of us believe and that is the deep state is at work in America and the deep state has benefited both the left and the right at various times\nPretty much has pretty much convinced people that um the leadership of the house of representatives will change or if that does happen um the Democrats have said\nLook this tax cuts that the Trump push through last year the majority of it went to wealthy people that's not fair we're going to reverse that I'm\nA ... a hold on to reverse that a doctor they'd have to have the house the Senate and the signature on the resolute desk right\nYes I'm told they're going to have a very difficult time doing that a\nParticularly if the Senate maintains control Republican control and President Trump won't won't sign it but there are some things that the house can do a true resolution buy them themselves even if they don't raise\nTaxes or they're certainly not going to support President Trump's latest plan which says we should I look for another tax cut this one geared a little more toward consumers rather than business the last tax cut\nThe the purpose of it was to increase economic growth and then indeed that that now to increase economic growth we have a capital intensive economy so to increase economic growth you have to create new capital\nHe did that by reducing corporate tax rate from an average of thirty five percent down to\nTruly if the Senate maintains control Republican control and President Trump won't\nWon't sign it but there are some things that the house can do a true resolution buy them themselves even if they don't raise\nTaxes or they're certainly not going to support President Trump's latest plan which says we should I look for another tax cut this one year and a little more toward consumers rather than business\nThe last tax cut the the purpose of it\nWas to increase economic growth and then indeed that that now to increase economic growth we have a capital intensive economy so to increase economic growth you have to create new capital\nHe did that by reducing corporate tax rate from an average of thirty five percent down to Twenty one percent and he or reduce personal income tax us for everybody including the upper class and the upper classes the one that creates new\nCapitals so the first tax cut was geared to economic growth\nUm there is a feeling that the the higher income people and they did made out better than a middle income people so now Trump is pushing um another middle class tax cut\nIf the Republicans maintain control both houses he's likely to get that if the day he died at the Republicans don't he's not likely to get that and I think the uh\nUh investor community is saying a look all the same as Trump has been doing to\nStimulate growth which appear to be working I don't have a difficult time keeping that up if the house of representatives with Dr\n... let me ask you why do we need to cool down the economy I understand the concern about inflation but the fan of says gee the economy is doing too well we're growing too fast\nWell water use too fast and can we grow without having too much inflation would a little bit of inflation right now necessarily be a bad thing\nWe we didn't have much inflation during all of the eight years of Obama before making a sound it would it would it be that bad if we had a little bit of inflation along with a massive amount of growth if the fed would stop crunching the economy\n[laughter] you know it's funny I just wrote a column in the hill a few days ago arguing that are exact point the twelve month inflation rate\nFor the last couple of months out higher than Spanish and the two point seven range but it has been inching down a little bit because we've pushed interest rates up\nNew home sales the last five months to death existing home sales have debt\nSo I'm there doesn't look to be any inflationary pressures yet and I think the Federal Reserve is over reacting to this similar to what you just said\nWe can get much higher quote look Ronald Reagan cut taxes in\nNineteen eighty one went into effect in Nineteen eighty two Trump modeled his tax cut after Reagan right when Reagan tax kinda went in and eighty two in Nineteen eighty four the economy had an annual growth rate of seven and a half percent so the fact that we're up in the four rains and tomorrow the third quarter\nNumber comes out or probably be in a high threes we're nowhere near as overheated economy the Federal Reserve I I Believe is over reacting to this they should do a little more slowly with interest rates the true interest rates are still below historical\nNormal but they've gone up so fast that uh we're having a negative impact on interest a sensitive sectors like house\nWe can't get much higher quote the wild Reagan cut taxes in Nineteen eighty one went into effect in Nineteen eighty two Trump modeled his tax cut after Reagan right\nWhen Reagan tax cut one in eighty two in Nineteen eighty four the economy had an annual growth rate of seven and a half percent so the fact that we're up in the four range and tomorrow the third quarter\nNumber comes out of ... being a high threes we're nowhere near as overheated economy the Federal Reserve I I Believe is over reacting to that they should do a little more slowly with interest rates the true interest rates are still below historical\nNormal but they've gone up so fast that uh we're having a negative impact on interest a sensitive sectors like housing and automobile\nSee Dr Russell if that's the concern I've got is that and I and I'm Wondering let me ask you straight out do you think the fed is reacting only because of the metrics or are they reacting somewhat politically as well to to crush on the economy that is making Donald Trump look like a train\nI certainly hope it faster latte or I don't I Hope they're not trying to push the economy a\nPresident Trump appointed a Jerome Powell to be a channel and uh so he's got his person in there and always been a little critical of him\nA ... lately I I'm not sure what the motivation is but they don't need to do this as fast as they're they're doing it on our ... rates were under four percent are now

showing the the addresses the big labels the fonts\nThey've made it very easy for copycat they've basically provided something that will look like it came from this bomber that anybody can generate at home and son from anywhere\nSo they ... they are kind of encouraging copy cats that way I think it was a mistake the show so much right off the bat that picture I think gave away too much information um it just helps copycats that that actual hoax bomb there with the wires at each end and the fact that that was PVC and had no black powder\nTells me that it's not a somebody even capable of making a real bomb like you've suggested you know to show that they're serious\nI don't think that the person that made that could make a real bomb or they would've pack black powder in it even with no initiation method\nJust so that it would be reported that they had black powder explores explosive or potential the way they are they are no no explosive potential if if somebody was really trying to make a effect because they would have put black powder into them\nEven with no ability to to detonate them so I I think that um that they're they are encouraging copy\nI think it was a mistake the

just sheer money responding like you said in the political pheromones to do this fall flat Republicans how embarrassing laughing and the Democrats\nThere'll be devastating if it turns out to be a a a a left wing or but on the other hand you know if if um if it's more elaborate plot than we know and and they've got some uh some Patsy stashed away to a you know dying to die in a shoe swat

the\nPolice officers you name it I Want to go to Devin in Missouri law enforce a police officer on bombs to everybody else it's holding you're on the air thanks for joining us Devon\n[noise] Yes sir thank you very much for having me on alec what's your take on all this\nYou know I'm\nKinda like use some times where they're they're just so many different avenues you can take this so I had to kind of focus my thinking and uh uh from an investigator standpoint I'm\nThinking about the bombs themselves ... it's just ridiculous but the bombs are so poorly made and they were sent to so many different people getting into the psychology of whoever's\nThan than ... it just the prime of fish it than the it just it's pretty obvious that\nPlane that who benefits he's he's almost always the key and then you check it out of it leads down that that that's where you're at the bono who benefits you as a motive to enter the history who's pre hyping their victims\nWhile they're calling for violence and then it died bombs none of them go off that all the experts say they look like they're fake and then they're grandstanding about it twelve days from election\nSo if I had to take a guess\nUh you know my best educated guess you know it it just looks like it benefits Democrats and they can they can gather sympathy from that they ... they can make themselves look like the victims and they can get a lot out of this I don't think people realize how\nThe tool that this can be for them are moving forward and what I really wanted to tell you about Alex this is the second part of my thinking and I think\nUh you'll really find that interesting if you haven't already maybe\nThought about this year so I see I'm from Missouri um\nThe the second one that really dawned on me a couple of days ago I was thinking about that you know how the euro being demonized infowars patriots in general\nA thought about the money back report you remember that\nOh we got from a federal marshals or that that literally was teaching them that veterans who number one enemy they said there will be ... we're going to have a war with the militia a and they were showing his radical Islam doesn't ... it's all Christians and veterans were the number one enemy that ... ...\n... they were telling us police officers you know here in Missouri that it you know Ron Paul stickers that you know target these people and we were like\nWell they were saying Ron Paul get out of the fed stickers aren't code to kill cops\nYeah yeah and so this day I'm there is still some sense of that out there for some officers and it's a ... it's just ridiculous but that that\nA couple of days ago I was thinking about that you know how the euro being demonized infowars patriots in general a thought about the money back report you remember that\nAlthough we got from a federal marshals uh that that literally was teaching them that veterans who number one enemy they should there will be ... we're going to have a war with the militia a and they were saying is radical Islam doesn't ... it's all Christians and veterans were the number one enemy that ...\n... they were telling us police officers you know here in Missouri that it you know Ron Paul stickers that you know target these people and we were like\nWell they were saying Ron Paul get out of the Fed's stickers aren't code to kill cops\nYeah yeah and so this Sunday um there is still some sense of that out there for some officers and it's a ... it's just ridiculous but that that was one of the first thing that popped into my head and you mention all the time things like the Oklahoma City bombing and it all ties that this has been going on for\nA very this is a leftist narrative to frame Americans as terrorist when the does right wing terrorists don't exist other than McVeigh and that was fake and and and and it's the left it's I mean Obama sat at the feet of the weatherman\n\nAbsolutely yeah and that's the psychology we're dealing with and um yeah see I see you got the ... pulled up and like I said just being from Missouri um that's something that kinda hit home for me personally but it should\nReal by the way it was going out to everybody it was just Missouri got its version written by the Southern Poverty Law Center and everything else are you guys got it out to ... well God Bless your debit amazing points anything else\nNow now just want to say that I'm a thank you very much for having me on in a God Bless you guys\nGod Bless you absolutely don't thank me I think you know I sat by an anti tops of a little bit just because\nI'm a constitutional motion they can be a danger but if it were bad and the cops aren't perfect but on average that are more awake in the military more wakes anybody I'm not ... that's what I Want to control you\nAnd it it it's it's why they hate us ... they they just hate this country and\nLaw enforcement uh military represent the nation and that's where the power is at the end of the day and they want to control you\nBut their attempt to turn the military against America fired\nIt backfired spectacularly some cops still buy into it but you know that's their problem there's always going to be getting a ... oh you got so many good colors homeowners now\nWas talking about bombings a former navy Steve and you're on the air thanks for holding go ahead\n[noise] [noise] yeah hello

walking making their way up to our southern border and actually some\nSome news was made today but it's it's news with some caution I got to be honest because we've been here before\nWe haven't had a caravan this big but we've been here before they're been caravans last caravan was at the end of April early may bought a thousand and you know where those thousand are now those thousand that came to our southern border back in April May there in America\nOkay we've been here before we got to change the way we do things but\nA couple of pieces of good news when it comes to this caravan the Trump Administration announced today that eight hundred a active duty soldiers will be sent to the border the troops will be sent to the border\nOr via Fox News ... ... troops number one\nSecretary Mattis expected the sign deployment orders later today authorizing hundreds of additional troops tend to southern border\nThese images show some of the national guard troops pet earlier that here by the press that official tell facts at least eight hundred additional active duty troops are part of the new for the heading to the southern border the request for assistance from the chats came last night that request\nThat the deadline of October thirtieth\nSo eight at least eight hundred troops by October thirtieth will be put on border or they're not infantry but there'll be down there for a reason to give me troops number two\nThings that composition of the trip is being determined as we speak by the joint staff here at the Pentagon they will not infantry troops will only be armed for itself the fat\nAnd who are they and what are they going to do gimme troops number three\nThey are engineers lawyers and medical personnel according to a Pentagon official and will be there and looks like a support the customs and border patrol\nThere'll be down there these eight hundred some a active duty soldiers there'll be down there to assist homeland security on the border there'll be down there to assist don't forget we got about Twenty one hundred or twenty two hundred National Guard\nThirtieth so eight at least eight hundred troops by October thirtieth will be put on the border or they're not infantry but there'll be down there for a reason give me troops number two\nThings that composition of the trip ... determined actually think by the giant staff here at the Pentagon they will not contain trans him will only be armed for self defense\nAnd who are they and what are they going to do gimme troops number three\nSay our engineers lawyers and medical personnel according to a Pentagon official and will be there unless like us support the customs and border patrol\nThere'll be down there these eight hundred and some are active duty soldiers there'll be down there to assist homeland security on the border there'll be down there to assist don't forget we got about Twenty one hundred or twenty two hundred National Guard troops down on the border dead and give me troops number for\nNot immediately clear where the forces will be going along the border but well providing according wrong they will not be making arrests on the border\nThis is a good move this is an important move it's a necessary move see\nWhat we have to try to do and I'll get to the other piece of news today in a second\nWe have to try to do is keep this caravan from getting to our border let's be honest and let's be real the thought of the image of ten eleven twelve Thirteen fourteen thousand of these folks at\nOur border a is an image that scares the heck\nOut of the Trump Administration and it should because again remember this past April you just had almost a thousand of them camped out on our border and then the TV cameras descended on them and then you had the women and children and you had these babies cry and then you add\nThese folks given their their their their legit sob stories and before you knew it the Trump Administration backed down the thousand or a migrants were led

the actual science but it seems to be incredibly\nGood and I have a future coming out January seventh through the went through a bullet mhm um and it's going to be in mid ... but it would be\nGood morning Geoff how are we today are good how're you doing I'm doing excellent so with us today are talking today we'd like to talk about a couple of things that you had mentioned that first I think we would like to talk about your seminar that she's not coming up\nSo it's um\nA body talk seminar we had a fundamental last month that we've had Seventeen people that tend to what it was a really good a technique it is similar to apply new theology but more ... than the actual science but it tends to be incredibly\nGood and I have a teacher coming out January seventeenth through the twentieth of Bolivia um and it's going to be in mid Phoenix\nBut uh it would be a four and a half days seminar\nOut all the fundamentals of body talk which allows you to uh after you take one more for day seminar to become a certified body talk specialists\nA if you're not treating the ... and if you're treating it then you get about four seconds to think about something before you react and therefore I'm much more there\nAnd then went over three brains are aligned you feel is symptoms of a cohesiveness and integrity that you don't yet if they're firing off in different directions\nYeah makes sense but it sounds completely right from my experience before\nThe um have you um\nHave you had a chance to kind of test yourself out on some of the difficulties that you had when you work in yet another word is it easier to pay attention is easier to read what kinds of specifics of you know to\n[noise] um I've noticed that if I have something like a a weekend with a family or I'm going out to um an event or something where I really need to regularly play focus without you know taking a little it's a dump me for my phone or\nWhatever just to keep my\nOn whatever coping skills I've developed over the years I don't have the chance to do that if I can take\nA little extra out there that I have no issue I used to have a kind of a an exhaustion like a brain fog that would come if I Would just try and focus for extended periods of time I'm I'm just kidding\nIn other words is it easier to pay attention it's easier to read what kinds of specifics of you know to\n[noise] um I noticed that if I have something like a weekend with the family or I'm going out to you I'm an event or something where I really need to regularly play focus without you know taking a little it's a dumped me for my phone\nOr whatever just to keep me\nGoing on whatever coping skills I've developed over the years I don't have a chance to do that if I can take\nA little extra there that I have no issue I used to have a kind of a an exhaustion like a brain fog that would come if I Would just try and focus for extended periods of time\nUm and just keep trying to do that even when I was starting to feel like a lot of [noise] the\nUm one of the things that's really interesting about the DVD is if you notice that it's hard to focus and you try harder the brain turns off if you if you're depressed and it's hard to focus you try harder it gets better\nUm so it's it's a very strange reaction in ADD is just such an opposite in mission to most others it's fascinating\n\nQuestion for you if you don't mind how long did it when she started taking their product and you saw in South results that you need something working in different their\nProblem I think I started feeling and voting difference in the same day taking that wow have always been a pretty sensitive person all kinds of therapy even though I'm but I I think it's like built up maybe it's better you know like a weekend or so I'd have to say\nBut I started noticing a lot of changes I Can't say how much of that with my personal placebo\n[laughter] discovery for me and you're talking about\nThat but um I've definitely noticed that impacts really quickly\nWhen we did the research over the ... clinic or what we did and we we kind of measure when the uh at church should work [noise] so we had him take the act here and then a half hour later went ahead and did the scans and you could see it in it\nSo it does work that's out so um you're definitely on target women\nIncredible\nTalent can you or your background a little bit because I'm I think that's important to very often you know what people assume is a UC have ADD can't really do well in school or you tend not to be real intelligence which is actually\nTotally the opposite but [noise]\nUm what's his what's background do you have\nUm I think overall I've managed to be a really good student I finished my undergraduate degree an inch creative nerve science um a few years ago and so thin in medical school for the last couple of years at the ... program\nI'm here in Tempe I'm I have to say I'm I've gotten away with a lot of really poor study habits and a lot of difficulty keeping organized and focus by just\nWhen I Am able to work well when I have a good day or a good couple of hours I've always been able to do more work than most everyone I Know\nThat seems to fit to because what happens is in in in the way\nTotally the opposite but um what what background do you have\n... I think overall I've managed to be a really good student I finished my undergraduate degree in integrative nerve science um a few years ago um in in medical school for the last couple of years that the ... republic program\nI'm here in Tempe um I'd have to say I'm I've gotten away with a lot of really poor study habits and a lot of difficulty keeping organized and focus but just\nWhen I Am able to work well when I have a good day or a good couple of hours I've always been able to do more work than most everyone I Know\nThat seems to fit to because what happens is in in in the way that I view ADD is that the electrical system is running too hot\nAnd so what it does shorts out and if you look at the famous people with ADD you find I'm dying and uh did Vinci and Newton and a whole bunch of other people so\nIt's it's just that the brain so powerful it takes much longer to get it under control and that causes untold difficulty with self esteem or the socialization\nThink that's great I'm so glad to hear that year and taking that into medical school and after a path again that's really awesome so didn't see it on so happy that you found this product and it's worked great for you\nYeah I Would have made a big difference that started it\nThank you so much for your time and calling in today we really appreciate it thank you\nThank you for doing this as well and thank you for working with such an amazing product thanks a lot\nUm we also ... I mean when you were talking with him had another call comment call in and she had a question about fat scan that you were talking earlier about the drunk person you have to have where she could get that scan and insurance coverage or is it only at your office so\nI'm a boy I Wish I have one in my office that would be awful pun um no it's a very very specialized can take 'em the equipment is probably about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to do you have to have a\nA lab people on staff to do so it is very very rare UPN do expect scan at the ... clinic in Newport California\nIt costs thirty four hundred dollars to do\nBut what they do is a complete evaluation and rest things can in a concentration scam and it takes over just worked out of diagnostics\nHowever um I may be some three or four people over a year because a Dr Ayman has made a written Taos [noise] that is exceptionally accurate\nFor everything except temporal ADD and ring of fire a DVD\nAnd so I usually send people over only if there's Brent been some kind of brain damage or I think they might have bipolar and I'm not sure I'm that sort of thing is is what I'll do usually you just don't need to go to the extent\nThank you so much for answering all of that I'm Jeanie thing else asked um well\nI guess you know we've been talking a lot about eighty and you know we talked a lot about the symptoms that most people may know about or their symptoms and things that maybe people don't really put together with ...\nLike okay so because the polarity is off their spatial does\nThat is exceptionally accurate for everything except temporal ADD and ring of fire a DVD\nAnd so I usually send people over only if there's Brent been some kind of brain damage or I think they might have bipolar and I'm not sure I'm that sort of thing is is what I'll do usually you just don't need to go to the expense\nThank you so much for answering all of that I'm genie out any thing else to ask a child um well I guess you know we're been talking a lot about eighty and you know we talked a lot about the symptoms that most people may know about or their symptoms and things that maybe people don't really put together with ...\nOr ... okay so because the polarity is off their spatial design is off an office so if you have somebody especially kid who is trying to write a title on a page\nVery often it won't be centered\nUm they tend to either right and very small script or incredibly large script [noise] um they have financial difficulties they have spatial design difficulties often times they don't really know where to stand in relationship to somebody else\nA they'll push right into your field without realizing it's kind of like a big dog\nUm [laughter] you know and um there are often inappropriate in reading social cues so they'll come up with something that\nYou wish they wouldn't have [noise] um [noise] you you really just kind of odd that behavior that doesn't match who they are um because they tend to being consistent brand new shimmering\nAnd so anything that doesn't make sense with who you think this person is should make you wonder\n[noise] so then what do we do and if you'd see someone that's you know kind of exhibiting behavior well\nYou you congratulate yourself that you have somebody who's smart [laughter] and then what you do is you do a little bit of reading you could either go and get my book which is healing or I'm a\nADD and add care or you could get these seven types of ADD by Dr Ayman you could go to my YouTube channel which is as the Internet therapist and watch some of the videos all those would give you information it's\nOne to kind of know about it it's pretty easy to spot it\nAnd once if you have it and they're treated you can see it everywhere\n[noise] Jeff for almost out of time please give us your website and your phone number one more time\nSo for eight o nine nine eight oh five six oh and indeed the hyphen C. A. R. E. dot com and adds to the Internet therapists dot com and the YouTube channel is that the Internet purpose as well\nHi Susan B. A. R. E. dot com and al ... the Internet therapists dot com and the YouTube channel is that the Internet therapists as well well\nBut it also packs of very large medicinal and nutritional punch for your body the medicinal use the term market actually dates back thousands of years it was major and argue Vatican medicine one of the oldest systems and medicine\nAnd the world and this is so cool some of the writings on on the medicinal use the term Rick\nWritten almost two thousand five hundred years ago\nThat's a long time ago and that gives me so much to be confident on because you have that history of us right now since have years of people consuming turmeric and getting those benefits\nBut today from one of the most clinically studied botanical though there so you have historical youth you have modern science coming together really are a lot to take notice of and and a lot to be confident in\nAll right so what are some of those major health benefits\nAnd you sometimes she'll have people coming in and asking for Tom Ricks\nSometimes we'll have them coming in and asking for for Kirk human yeah because ... is the most research component of term markets that powerful antioxidant right and that's actually been the focus of a lot of the research um 'cause you know here doesn't need more antioxidants right we all want to age gracefully Puff Daddy right\nTerm or it Germany is a wonderful antioxidants biased and and one of the most exciting areas of research on turmeric is how is the port's healthy information and the body and\nHow many people do you talk to every day that are suffering with a lack of of joint flexibility having trouble getting around to the state is missing their joints\nWill turmeric is being researched for that you also think about turmeric and those Kirk humanoid said it contains helping support the liver hoping supports the bodies\nThe talks that case you think about you probably have customers that will come in and take turmeric for their skin will it make sense because if you think about healthy blood\nHealthy body that supports good clear skin as well right even them even research for digestive health I mean my gosh the research could go on and on and on\nWide variety of benefits both historical validation and and certainly as we're talking about now modern science\nHow many people do you talk to every day that are suffering with a lack of a joint flexibility having trouble getting around to the state is missing their joints more turmeric as being researched for that you also think about turmeric and those Kirk humanoid it contains\n... support the liver hoping supports the bodies\nThe talks that case you think about you probably have customers that will come in and take turmeric for their skin will it make sense because if you think about healthy blood\nAnd healthy body that supports good clear skin as well right even them even research for digestive health I mean my gosh the research could go on and on and on\nWide variety of benefits or historical validation and and certainly as we're talking about now modern science\nAnd I know new trickle makes an incredible products now called to marry her human goal which teachers at clinically research extract death to America so tell us a little bit more about this specific tumor and extract and you said\nI Would love to you know there's so many everybody wants to term rent and because of that there's a lot of different brands out there that that feature turmeric and I know it gets kind of confusing trying to weed through all the marketing\nItself there but ultimately I think that we can all agree that if we're looking for a turmeric we want a turmeric supplement that actually works something that the truly delivers the businesses\nThat were seeking so I always look for clinically researched extracts of turmeric\nAnd knew through gold really delivers here the Turkmen gold product that you mentioned\nIt actually features the most extensively studied end clinically documented extractive term Rick currently available and by most clinically proven we're talking more than eighty research papers\nAnd now over forty five human clinical that have been published in peer reviewed journals on this wow it's a turmeric extract this is huge for the ... world so we're\nWe're talking research for joining flexibility liver detox Colin health\nI health and health you name it highly validated extract not just for effectiveness but also a validated for safety as well\nWow so you know you mentioned joint health and it's one of the number one reasons you know why are you in our customers coming in here and they are they're taking a turmeric so can you share with us um like on the research maybe about how it specific to supporting the joint how\nAbsolutely you know I so many people you come in contact with they have issues with their joints stiffness lack of flexibility limited mobility\nAnd and and not only is this just a real drag you know in terms of pain but\nIt also keeps them from fully living fully experiencing life you know from doing their jobs from traveling from seeing the world even playing with the grandkids and be impacted right\nThat people don't loosen but they want solutions that that are healthy solutions that create balance not something that's addictive something that's destructive right\nRight there is a study that was published back in twenty sixteen on joined health using the same exact term or that you find in ... and gold\nAnd what I Love developed this research is that it really represented were modern sciences today when it comes to join hills we now recognize that that joins Stutzman is and and lack of flexibility\nThat's not always just for mechanical stresses on the ...\nDrag you know in terms of pain but it also keeps them from fully living fully experiencing life you know from doing their jobs from traveling from seeing the world even playing with the grandkids and be impacted right\nIf people want to loosen but they want solutions that that are healthy solutions that create balance not something that's addictive something that's destructive right\nRight there is a a a study that was published back in twenty sixteen on joined health\nUsing the same exact term or that you find in camera curriculum and gold and what I loved about this research is that it really represented were modern sciences today when it comes to join hills\nWe now recognize that that joint Stutzman is and and lack of flexibility that's not always just for mechanical stresses on the joint it can also come from oxidative stress as well do you think about too much free radical activity not enough antioxidants in the body\nSo in this trial\nThere were fifty three subjects that were enlisted and all of the subjects had joint stiffness and they're nice man that lost some ability and the treatment group was taking Fifteen hundred milligrams per day of this term Rick extract they took it and divided doses throughout the day\nWhen was the ... and the results were so fascinating\nNot only were their pain scores decreasing\nMeaning less business a more joint mobility but as their pain scores were decreasing their\nBlood measurements of antioxidants like eh so de included ... those were increasing so we were saying that this this extractive term Rick had a powerful impact on antioxidants status as well so truly a leading to more balance in the body really exciting\nSad how much difference do you need to take and hold on you need to take it to get these benefits for the joint house\nThat's a great question will will in the research that we were just discussing the treatment groups of the group actually taking the term ... they were taking Fifteen hundred milligrams per day of the curriculum and see three turmeric extract and they were doing it and divided doses you know so you think about one with each mill\nThis is the same extract you find and neutral termer Purchaman gold and it's the same amount you find in the full daily serving of three cats so I always say if you want to get those clinically research benefits\nYou have to take what was actually used in the research and winning with noodles trauma Kirkland gold you can do just that\nIn fact if you ever see clinically proven on a neutral botanical new tripled or you can always feel confident the dosing instructions cause it mirrors what was used and the research and something else that I think that you'll really appreciate\nIs that in that clinical trial that we were talking about it lasted just six weeks so according to the research these participants for getting these great benefits for their ... and a pretty short period of time\nAnd I know for your customers that they do a joint flexibility issue time as always of the essence right they need something that word and they needed to\nWork yes oh yeah like within the hour [laughter] right [laughter] you know if only write write only so um and you know we were talking a little bit about how this determine human gold support liver and our liver health so how does it benefit our liver\nYeah well you know if we look at the store go use the term Rick we see that it was also often used as a blood purifying or abused Bill Clinton\nAnd they'll say that I think that you'll really appreciate is that in that clinical trial that we were talking about it lasted just six weeks so according to research these participants for getting these great benefits for their ... inch and a pretty short period of time\nAnd I know for your customers that they do a joint flexibility issues time as always of the essence right they need something that word and they needed to\nWork yes oh yeah like within the hour [laughter]\nRight [laughter] you know if only write write only so um and you know we were talking a little bit about how this determine human\nGold support our liver and her liver health so how does it benefit our liver\nYeah well you know if we look at the store go use the term Rick we see that it was also often used as a blood purifying or abused Bill Clinton's the blood\nAnd now modern sciences is showing how traumatic really does support the liver which you think about as as your body's filter right\nMhm stood two major ways that it supports deliver first you think about through its antioxidant function the liver encounters a lot of oxidative stress you think about the chemicals that we encounter the pollution\nThat we breathe then asked decides we consume that's a lot of oxidative stress there so we need\nThat steady supply of antioxidants to kind of shield and protect the body from all that oxidative stress\nThis is really cool so not only its turmeric itself a powerful antioxidant\nBut it's also been research for helping the liver make more glued asylum\nWhich is one of your body's number one antioxidants for protecting and helping with the detoxification that's number one through its antioxidant protection but number two you think about turmeric being classified as a bitter it's actually better to the taste\nAnd I was actually leading a discussion recently where we were talking about how bitter taste bitter foods\nThey pretty much have disappeared from that standard American diet you know it's not just the leafy greens but a lot of us don't get those bitter herbs either we get a lot of savory a lot of we eat a lot of salty foods but not many visitors\nHealthy house called Arizona's most popular live on a talk radio show with rocky today by

have to have retirement savings got cut off the end of age do I have a retirement savings\nSo if you look at what they're asking do I spend every penny of what I make I came up with three questions you should ask yourself how you say the least twenty five to fifty percent of what you are going to do that to say you can't do that okay look I got kids living right here\nThey lived with us up until they're in their late twenties in fact one of the kids still lives with her dad and she's in her late twenties you're living at home you have no bills\nRight you have a job she has a job she makes

a hundred percent more than what you had the day before you could start with fifty percent savings plan right that\nEasily just like the guy saying if you get a raise that raises you don't have it right now you can save half of that race\nIf you can only afford twenty five percent as you go out and buy assets and they start to increased income that's pass if it's on the outside of what you have like\nYou need none of that because you had none of it so every dime of what you earn passively should be saved so now you've got you're saving twenty five percent of your pay check in every dime of what you make that we now have you told the networks have been closer to fifty percent\nWith that kind of ratio and with re investments you're going to be a millionaire and no time at all second

Seventy percent of what we do a disability safety is training um which is a huge piece to different organizations and companies throughout all kinds of different uh\nUm you know general industry construction mining all those things but the other thing that we do also we do onsite inspections we do analysis of your site\nUm we can get recommendations of those type of inspections or we also do manuals and planned building so now we can come in and you got a new company that you're getting ready to start or you're a smaller construction companies don't have a safety um policies\nA manual written or don't have a a safety a program installed within your company to create some type of culture or within your employees we do all those different things\nNow what kind of companies do you work with\nSo we worked we definitely a construction a lot of that but we do anything from plumbers to dirt work guys I'm all through mining industries which is you know copper mining which is metal on metal mining underground mining so we took on a different industries also in general industry\nWill touch on different bases of\nTire shops will will go into wall Wal Mart a Lowe's all those different industries that we\nNormally don't know that there needs to be safety training and really need\nWell there's a lot of people that is a big right now and the reason why is because there's so much weirdness going on in the world is that kind of is that what's going on\nYes it there is been I'm a huge barrier within the safety programs for many years that we've actually kind of flat lined\nI'm within our safety programs in the company's um we have a high failure rate just within construction in general industry that's crazy which is thousands if they tell you so I'm having some awareness and that and and getting owners and you know management and leadership\nTo identify that there is a struggle within safety and to bring some awareness of the employees and challenge our employees as what we need to do\nRight intimate just to make sure that your employees are safe\nNo matter what always and so we've got our lines open here and we're going to enter everybody and to win and on the site safety it's an inspection that you're going to get our number here is six to seven seven five three six nine toll free it's one eight six six five three six eleven hundred\nSo okay I Want to talk about something 'cause when I first started talking to you I didn't realize it but now I Do\nUh your opinion what is your opinion of online training and why companies need desert valley safety training instead\nWell we've had a a real deep influx of online training and we have a lot of industries and huge organizations like Wal Mart's Lowe's\nHome Depot do different organizations that older employees do online training and for me um it's a huge miss a there is very little room there to have actual interaction with those employees\nAnd so they just come in and they just click through the button so there's very little retention right safety retention of what you're learning and which doesn't really shake you come in you have an instructor led a training course it's one on one or you can definitely ah learn a lot from interact on ... definitely hands on\nThat's awesome so Ken let's talk about your classes what do you do your training courses\nSo within the training courses of course we offer awareness courses which is your your ...\nHad a a real deep influx of online training and we have a lot of industries and huge organizations like Wal Mart's Lowe's\nHome Depot do different organizations that all their employees do online training and for me um it's a huge miss a there is very little room there to have actual interaction with those employees\nAnd so they just come in and they just click through the button so there's very little retention right safety retention of what you're learning and which doesn't really say can you come in you have an instructor led a training course it's one on one or you can definitely ah learn a lot from interact on ... definitely hands on\nThat's awesome so Ken let's talk about your classes what do you do your training courses\nSo within the training courses of course we offer awareness courses which is your your ... general basis of of learning right but then you have authorized person you've got competent person training he got qualified person trains there's different levels\nOf what that training needs to be and unfortunately a lot of the industry and even owners and managers don't realize that there's different levels of training that our employees need\nAnd so offering those different levels of training throughout all the different courses OSHA tens OSHA thirties\nUh your em shot training courses and all the way down to your site specific courses or even company specific courses like for protection confined space ask evading infringing right and understanding that they're confident persons that needed for those for inspections and I'm so there's a lot to them\nNow your website is a deer valley and figure it's desert valley safety dot com desert valley safety dot com they call you and they can get you do consultations with them how does it work how do they how do you start working with someone\nYou know somebody can call in or they can call my number forty eight to five six six eight for or go to devalue safety dot com\nOr you have access to email there and you can send me a request I'm In ... requests what your needs are if if you need policy looking at your policy your program manuals if you want us to come in and help you recreate a new culture a new safety culture within your company we can come do that we can evaluate that what that looks like\nAnd then we can put together a plan along with your leadership to figure out how to put that together the other thing we can do to send us information and let us know hey I Need some fall protection training uh but I don't know what level of training we need\nTo me an email call me and we can get you set up in the right path of training\nIt's desert valley safety dot com the phone number to call it's for Ito eight to five six six eight four\nAnd we've got everyone entered into winning on site safety inspection our number here six so to to seven seven five three six dimes and toll free it's one eight six six five three takes eleven hundred what I Love about my show the most\nInformation for people out there that's what it is and maybe you maybe it's someone that you know that might want something that's it that's what it's all about\nTell them about it so again the number to call here is sick though to to seven seven five three six nine your guinea answered into when an onsite safety inspections now I Want to you know I there is there's a difference between poor\nI'm going to just do it this way and good safety right what's the difference\nSo the way that I look at something like that is when you have management or leadership programs or\nSupervisor site supervisors superintendents on site and they're not practicing or the safety programs that are in place usually in some policies um but that it all the way down to something simple is P. B. right wearing your gloves wearing your\nA safety glasses wearing your heart out and when you don't have upper leadership I'm falling those ... practices the employees are going to fall off board right so\nThat's it that's what it's all about tell them about it so again the number to call here is six so to to seven seven five three six nine you're getting entered into when an onsite safety inspections now I Want to you know I there is there's a difference between poor I'm going to just do it this way and good safety right what's the difference\nSo weird that I looked at something like that is when you have management or leadership programs or\nYou supervisor site supervisors superintendents on site and they're not practicing or the safety programs that are in place usually in some policies um but that it all the way down to something simple is P. B. right wearing your gloves wearing your\nA safety glasses wearing your heart out and when you don't have upper leadership I'm falling those ... practices the employees are going to fall off board right so I'm good practice and the bad practices as having leadership leading on your safety program because you want to lead by example\nRight so let's start to the top I said it wrong and I said there's so much craziness when the world but really what you're talking about it's just\nThe people in your own business right there that are not following the safety procedures and ... and the because most of them probably maybe even don't even know about 'em right they don't even remember them they might have even like you said they've gone online they'd done it really quick was done out the door they got hired or whatever and that was that right now but you do it hands on\nBut then when you work with them hands on did they you come to them they come to you how does it work\n[noise] yeah so they can they can get on a desert valley safety dot com and get a hold of me we do offer safety a supervisor training\nUm and so in different levels too so if you want your supervisors to get some um leadership training on how to build relationships with employees and also how to understand the different levels of training that each and every single person's different or millennials are much different than the baby boomers\nAnd so identifying those different training levels it's completely different and so we offer that aspect I've done ... many many different studies and I've done a lot of different homework on understanding how to do that training and so we offer that and we can help you guide your company in the rye dream\nIs so true what you said because it's ... and most of us baby boomers down I had to talk to you millennials is that correct\nI'm right on but we don't we don't know I'm not a millennial but the millennials we do have more challenges cause they learn differently\nHey do yes they do and K. and so you could check them out on their website it's desert valley safety dot com do you work valley wide\nYes we're state wide or we will also a bill countrywide if we need to\nYou got a company that you got a company here in Arizona and you're in California or Nevada has mandatory requirements for OSHA tens or thirties or we will travel and we will meet you\nAgain that phone number to call them direct it's for you know eight to five six six eight for their website is\nDesert valley safety dot com and their state wide and everyone's getting entered into when an onsite safety inspection again the number here six so to to seven seven five three six nine real quickly a safety related concerns what's the most uh biggest one that you see\nMy safety really the concern of the biggest one I see is the lack of safety leadership um we have a lot of individuals out there that still push production over safety and the biggest thing for me and this is the one of the biggest things I teach in my classes that safety\nUm that safety is part of the work so when you're doing the job you're doing it correctly you're doing it safely so safety is doing it right\nAgain the number here six so to to seven seven five three six nine real quickly a safety related concerns what's the most biggest one that you see\nMy safety related concern the big when I see is the lack of safety leadership um we have a lot of individuals out there that still push production over safety and the biggest thing for me and this is the one of the biggest things I teach in my classes that safety\nUm that safety is part of the work so when you're doing the job you're doing it correctly you're doing it safely so safety is doing right\nI Love it and let me just say something about Roland is that he had said that at all about making it created it's a creative way of getting you that the house you always wanted a cat right money either I'm loving the way that you just said that because it's also\nGuarantee you the way people are thinking in these days what an ideal down the line okay that I'm going to be able to make money off the house that I'm living in it's perfect to be able to read it out to people absolutely and then sell it and this is an awesome like what interests say wait what\nWill I get that I get that a lot you know of course you go to a if you're a mortgage lender or a realtor uh every every family function you go to a you get you get just bang with what are the rates you know so what's\nThe big market look like\nAnd and not all aunts and uncles sound like that but most most do\nAh especially in the mid west and you get back there and that's what people want to know and guess what rates are higher than there were three years ago right and they're lower than they were six years ago and there are higher than maybe what they might be next spring and probably lower than what they will be two years from now so\nThe point of that is ... is that rates go up they go down they grow up they go down right now we're in an environment where rates are continuing to go up but\nI talked to my parents and I talked to you know anybody when I take the pull their credit and I I have a a\nA they have a birth date in the forties or fifties and we talk about interest rates\nThey they laugh at the fact that people think five and a quarter is that it's absorbent higher rate you know but it's early\nNineteen percent and\nI was getting away with murder you know\n[laughter] um but uh you know and the same thing with housing ... every time people talk about interest rates they also want to know about housing what's going on with housing do I buy now wins the best time to buy 'em so if you go from Nineteen hundred\nTo twenty twenty right the line of home values on average is going to be on it up line right the whole time ... the\nAnd they draw a straight line from today to Nineteen hundred\nAnd I talked to you know anybody when I take the pull their credit and I I have a a a they have a birth date in the forties or fifties and we talk about interest rates they they laugh at the fact that people think five and a quarter is that it's absorbent higher rate you know but it's early\nNineteen percent and\nI was getting away with murder you know\n[laughter] um but uh you know and the same thing with housing ... every time people talk about interest rates they also want to know about housing what's going on with housing do I buy now wins the best time to buy 'em so if you go from Nineteen hundred\nTo twenty twenty right the line of home values on average is going to be on it up line right the whole time ... the\n... and they draw a straight line from today to Nineteen hundred\nValues are higher\nMost likely they'll continue on that are there little dips and valleys peaks and valleys in the real estate market yes there are\nUm are there going to be like your first time homebuyers the one thing they're really worried about is oh I I'm just so nervous to buy because I knew somebody that bought you know ten years ago and then they lost all the value and it wasn't worth anything anymore and\nUm that was ... I could do a two hour show on that um I I think they did do a two hour show it's called the big short\nAnd you can go see that on Netflix but um the thing is now is that actually people have to prove that they can make a mortgage payment and actually have to bring money to the table to buy a house so when the when the housing market is propped up by people that can actually pay their mortgages\nIt'll continue to go and baby boomers right\nThey're retiring like crazy I fifty thousand or excuse me fifty million baby boomers are set to retire in the next uh five to seven years that's a lot that's where they're coming they're coming in Scottsdale batty never lie on I felt ... absolutely there's no hurricanes there is no mudslides there is no tornadoes\nReally hot it's fine you're in your car or you're in a home and the only thing on\nEarth me as we used to be able to say there is no mosquitos but I've had some mosquitos lately I've gotten any mosquitoes anyway let's get some websites out there ... than we have to get people connected and we need to get people in homes\nAbout first of all you want to call or text him the phone number six had two five one at three three six eight six now you can check them out on his website which is rolling Bennett loans and to be an N.

the break but you know a doc is help so many people out there and here's the one thing that I Know people are procrastinators they really are\nWe all are we all hold herself back every person that I work with this I Wish I had to come and saw ... years ago I Wish I'd done this so how many are there out there that say I wish I had done that or how many people say\nI thought about that invention years ago ... that's my idea but they didn't do anything mhm so I get people to pull the trigger that get people to move forward I get people to get off the couch and the thing is you have more fun\n\nAnd we are talking with Dr ... owner of hypnotic one doctor I've been working with you for I don't know how long now it'll be eight years we've been trying to figure it out over the over the break but you know a doc is help so many people out there and here's the one thing that I Know people are procrastinators they really are\nWe all are we all hold yourself back every person that I work with us I Wish I had to ... years ago I Wish I'd done this oh how many are there out there that say I wish I had done that\nOr how many people say I thought about that invention years ago ... that's my idea but they didn't do anything mhm so I get people to pull the trigger that get people to move forward I get people to get off the couch and the thing is\nYou have more ... by being successful than you do something on the couch watching your friends to be though\nHow many people out there can be sitting there right now and just visualize what it feels like to be in that zone we all know that feeling and when we're in it we all get it we all get it once in a while had at one time I Need it\nAnd as we get older that's why my my age group is a little bit older the young people are easy to make successful the older ones that have set there and they listen to our show they listen to it they want to think about it because they're afraid of failure\nIf you're afraid of failure you're not going to do anything and when you don't do anything you're guaranteed failure again so we get the person out and say you don't want\nHim British and go forward and all of a sudden they're successful nice of why it took me so long to come in and she is I don't know\nWell I'll tell you what this is the thing doc is on the air right now with me and so I'm here I live here today but what we're doing is we're going to have you call them direct leave a message just talk to them tell them what's going on it's a free consultation that phone number it is area code\nSix though two by four seven zero for for six I implore people to do it just calling to leave the message and then guess what you're going to find out how we can help you what he can do for you and I guarantee you you're going to say that sounds pretty interesting I'd like to do that\nThat's it and the thing is if you won't get off the couch you know what there's somebody in your life that probably wants to be successful given my number and once they become successful you go why didn't I Do too and all of a sudden we get people like that I had one lady come in years ago\nAnd I I knew her friend and she recommended her and she come in first stop smoking and then she come in for depression view of things and her friend recommended me saw how quick and easy it was that she actually come in for bad sleep\nAnd a little bit of depression and what works so fast for her she sent her husband in for anger issues and then when he changed so quickly in a week or two then they sent their three kids and\nI tell you that it always works like that with you and I to everybody tells me that oh well I ended up sending my [noise] my my daughter and or this and that because you it actually when something's going on with you\nIt affects everybody everybody around you are everybody around you and usually when you start changing somebody else sees that and say wow what is she doing that I'm not doing it and that's that everybody\nWants to be successful successful health wealth and happiness if you don't have those three things than life kind of kind of boring and down and everything else everybody wants more health wealth and happiness why why do you think it was a billion and a half dollars on ads\nOn that Meg I'm actually a day the thing is is people get excited about that they ...\nAnd then when he changed so quickly and a week or two then they sent their three kids in\nI tell you that it always works like that with you and I to everybody tells me that oh well I ended up sending my [noise] my my daughter and or this and that because you it actually when something's going on with you\nIt affects everybody everybody around you are everybody around you and usually when you start changing somebody else sees that and I'd say wow what is she doing that I'm not doing it and that's that everybody\nWants to be successful successful health wealth and happiness if you don't have those three things than life kind those kind of boring and down and everything else everybody wants more health wealth and happiness why why do you think as a billion and a half dollars on ads\nOn that Meg I'm actually a day the thing is people get excited about that they started dreaming about it\nHow 'bout dream about taking action and getting out of that couch getting off the couch moving for getting out of at losers zone and I'd say it but you know what if you don't change if you're not moving forward then everybody's moving around you and they're becoming successful so why not join them and go\nAnd why not have some coaches and trainers every successful person listen to this one more time every successful person has had a successful trainer behind him I've had a lot of successful trainers\nIt it was a natural for me\nThey took me under their wing and I had a lot of professors and a lot of successful trainers put me under the wing and actually take me out of my comfort zone and all of a sudden they become my comfort zone being in winning so\nI'll tell you another thing about being the example being the example of that person within your family at the doing something a little different and beginning yourself it it all starts with at the top so whoever's out the top there you know whether it's your that the father or mother or\nLet's see you guys make a change and watch your whole entire family will\nI've had so many people I Want to I Want to get my daughter and I want to get my grandson I Want to get this person and I'm like get my sister and I was just first of all why aren't they in it now because you haven't motivated them why don't you come in and we'll get you motivated and you'll be the leader you'll be the mentor you'll be the winner\nAnd everybody wants to take onto a winner and a mentor we all need mentors I've lost many mentors over the years 'cause we get older we are mentors was older than us\nAnd a mentor cannot be the mentor for everything in your life or otherwise my father was a great worker is a farmer and fantastic man\nBut he didn't know how to do finance he didn't know how to do some things mom did\nAnd a dad said you can't do this mom said you could but you use a mentor for what they're good at one person can not be a mentor for everything and that's what most people have miss miss the boat and otherwise you got a financial mentor you got a health mentor you got this\nDon't rely on doctors don't rely on the ... don't rely on everybody else do it use these people and I'm not meaning use them but I mean followed them\nAnd if they're not leaving you in the direction that you need to go move on to another person but you have to know what you want and most people don't know what they want they know what they don't want they don't want to smoke they don't want to be fat they don't want to be ... they don't want to do this\nWhat do you what I Want to be free of alcohol I Want to be free of back well I Want to move forward I Want to be the man in my life or I Want to be in control of my emotions my life\nSuccess well I'll tell you what are the best thing to do is just pick up the phone give him a call leave a message and he will tell you exactly what he can do for you\nThe boat and otherwise you got a financial mentor you got a health mentor you got this don't rely on doctors don't rely on the ... don't rely on everybody else do it use these people and I'm not meaning use them but I mean followed them\nAnd if they're not leaving you in the direction that you need to go move on to another person but you have to know what you want and most people don't know what they want they know what they don't want they don't want to smoke they don't want to be fat they don't want to be ... they don't want to do this\nWhat do you what I Want to be free of alcohol I Want to be free of back well I Want to move forward I Want to be the man in my life or I Want to be in control of my emotions my life\nAnd success well I'll tell you what are the best thing to do is just pick up the phone give him a call leave a message and he will tell you exactly what he can do for you\nThat ... has been doing this now for over Thirty years he has a Ninety eight percent success rate and this is that free sixty minute consultation to you you're getting that CD everyone loves them\nAnd you just keep it it's going to make it sleep like a baby and that probably make you motivated to write that same time the number six so two by four seven zero for for sick leave a message calling now\nCustom built every program for the person not their problem because they really don't know the problem they know the symptoms they're overweight now that's not the problem that's a symptom\nWhy are they eating so much they're suffering down I had a Seventy four year old lady yesterday at I've worked with him about three different weeks and the thing is she all shut and understood everything\nSometimes it's like a light switch you just change the first session sometimes is more like a sunrise it takes you a little while but she says I understand it now I Know why I ate too much I Know why I did this and this and this I Know why I didn't put me number one\nAnd specially ladies out there you have been trained to be second class I'm Sorry but you have been trained to be second class I Love mothers because they don't want when I was on the farm and everybody was sick in our family guess who milk the cows guess who made the lunch ... guess who but did the laundry it was mom\nBecause that's what she was trained do come on ... list be honest with herself we need to be successful we need to move forward we need to do things and if it's really simple and easy you've already done it\nBut you don't think it's as simple and easy but it really is\nAnd all you have to do is pick up the phone and given the call and he'll talk to you and tell you what he can do it to customize program to meet your needs he won't let you fail and it's a lifetime guarantee in my opinion people shouldn't wait they should not a lot of people this time of year say oh I'll Wait till after the first year\nDo now so yeah I did do it because when you do it right now because during the holidays is a very stressful time and you're really is and the kids are wanting toys and everything else but the thing is stressful [noise] the thing is is\nPeople are over eating their over drinking they're overdoing everything\nBut when you can take him curtail it I don't just get people off alcohol we can control it otherwise some people do not want to stop drinking that's fine they now drink two or three match it or they drink one or two or\nThey're trying to take that weight off and now they only\nA slice of cheesecake instead of the whole thing right but the thing is is they're not looking for food or drugs or anything else for their fun pleasure and excitement they're fun pleasure and excite me is like when there's a little kid it comes from New York\nHolidays is a very stressful time and you're really is and the kids are wanting toys and everything else but the thing is stressful [noise] nothing is is people are over eating their over drinking or over doing everything\nBut when you can take him curtail it I don't just get people off alcohol we can control it otherwise some people do not want to start breaking that's fine they now drink two or three ... ship uh-huh or they drink water or\nThey're trying to take that weight off and now the only\nA slice of cheese ... instead of the whole thing right but the thing is is they're not looking for food or drugs or anything else for their fun place and excitement\nThey're fun pleasure excited me is like when there's a little kid it comes from your physical action your your mental thoughts and going forward it's a toll mindset change because if you don't change your mind said you'll never change what you get\nSo that's what made me decide to help people you know I couldn't go back to the nursing 'cause of my accident because my interest to my back and I just really want to help as many people can understand that there is an option for them\nVersus the electric company said our bills have gone up so significantly this summer Carol I'm I've seen some of the highest increases and when it's not it's not that these are not the last of the increases\nUm you know if we think that this year's increases the last and this is what our power bills are going to be for the remainder of our life\nWe're kidding ourselves there will be continuous increases to our power bills I'm about putting my family's hard earned money back in their own pockets versus the power company the power companies make in the millions a pissed made four hundred and eighty million dollars last year before this price increase so I'm just saying\nTake your take your circumstances power that you need for your home and your family it is essential it's something that we all need we're always going to need power\nUm and where we live in Arizona it's hot in the summertime we don't want to come home and have to between three and eight PM shut off for a seat and live on comfortably in our own houses\nThat is unconscionable to me so I Am able to show my families how to produce their own power pay less for it and have their roof producing the power of paying their power bill and paying them money into their pocket\nNow each time they get a bill okay I Want to I'm kind of listen to do a one on one hand me so every time I now get a bill if my if my roof is now paying for me and let's say I get a bill now that's three hundred Ninety four little negative negative yep three hundred Ninety four dollars and Eighteen sense\nThat then goes towards my next bill wrecked yeah so then what happens is each month whatever it is let's say that bill\nAnd we're we live in Arizona it's hot in the summertime we don't want to come home and have to between three and eight PM shut off for a seat and live uncomfortable in our own houses\nThat is unconscionable me so I Am able to show my families how to produce their own power pay less for it and have their roof produce him in power and paying their power bill and paying them money into their pocket\nNow each time they get a bill okay I Want to I'm kind of listen to do a one on one hand me so Everytime I now get a bill if my if my roof is now paying for me and let's say I get a bill now that's three hundred and Ninety four little negative negative yep three hundred Ninety four dollars and Eighteen sense\nThat then goes towards my next bill wrecked yeah so then what happens is each month whatever it is let's say that bill\nWas enough it's going to be even more negative because now it's had that negative already to begin with so now it's going to be even more negative and then by the end of the year passes cutting you a check they cut the check and they have to cut the child doesn't keep on rolling in there just check if it's less than\nTwenty five dollars they roll it forward if it's more than twenty five dollars they mail you a check\nAnd so you can buy some nights empower the teacher healthcare you're much nighttime power there's still a little bit of fees and taxes but this negative three hundred and some odd dollars page your next month power bill for your nighttime power and those fees and talk and you write a check to appeal for nothing\nAnd you still have a negative amount that carries over that they owe you come December thirty first the end of the year I'm going to have families that are going to get well over a thousand dollars back from Libya\nAbsolutely and does it at it than it starts at the beginning of yes yeah okay yeah and so we're talking about this produce your own power writer do cheer on power and pay less for it and you know it's all about the kill a lot it's about\nThe cost of your kill a lot this year we paid attention to what we were
