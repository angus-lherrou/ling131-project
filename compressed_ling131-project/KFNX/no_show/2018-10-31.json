city of their arrival there was no welfare waiting for them or they wouldn't have gotten in the country if they had no means of support you didn't get in here\nSo the rest of the story you open the

know how old he died young you know\nKilling himself here in this country very set I Wish I'd known him but he's the astronaut or the family and Sam I call them the Ashton or the family of one of my

chain\nAnd so it's across the board it's not just frogs who are benefiting from the massive wave of immigrants it's also people on the other side who run the service industry [noise]\nWhat about this caravan of a hundred of tens of what is it ten thousand twenty thousand ragtag migrants who's paying for the bus ride now to the border who's ever paying for those bus rides is an enemy of our way of life they are trying to invade the nation\nThe only good news is that the caravan so called is slowing down on its own momentum it's running out of steam a lot of the people are just going home for a number of reasons and it's ... mainly because we have a president\nTo his credit who was willing to stand up and say enough is enough with sending the military to the border we've sent the national guard to the border and that's it you're not coming in forget about it you're just not getting any here that's what he was elected to do for that reason alone\nDonald Trump is doing a great job I mean let's be clear here again it's easy to say he's not doing everything right but given the the opposition here it's lucky still in the in the position that he's in\nThat snap so apparently they're not going to get through this country so he's into this country so easily and the rodeo that was expected around our polling places may not be conducted as the left wants so they're slowing down\nAnd apparently they're being turned back some of going back on their own that's the good news\nAnd uh let's see what else is going on the uh Pittsburgh thing is not over with the president is arriving in Pittsburgh dj shortly\nAnd the left wing anti American creeps had the nerve\nTo make believe that those Jews these left wing fanatics of this uh bend the arc group funded by Alexander ... speaks for all Jewish people in Pittsburgh or America it's sickening because it only stirs up anti Semitism\nBecause when you start to make believe that your small band of Marxist new world order one world order however you want to be the fine you anti Americans on the left\nYou make believe you speak for all Jewish people and you don't there are many many conservative Jewish people were never heard from by the government in the media and yet what you do by speaking for the Jewish people\nAnd uh let's see what else is going on the uh Pittsburgh thing is not over with the president is arriving in Pittsburgh dj shortly and the left wing anti American creeps had the nerve\nTo make believe that those Jews these left wing fanatics of this uh bend the arc group funded by Alexander ... and all that speaks for all Jewish people in Pittsburgh or America it's sickening because it only stirs up anti Semitism\nBecause when you start to make believe that your small band of Marxist new world order one world order however you want to be defined you anti Americans on the left\nYou make believe you speak for all Jewish people and you don't there are many many conservative Jewish people that were never heard from by the government in the media and yet what you do by speaking for the Jewish people when you don't make you believe you do is you start to anti Semitism\nAnd yet they want you to believe that all of Pittsburgh Jewish community doesn't want Trump to the exact opposite is true\nAnd he's on the way there and I pray that go on the left wing fanatics funded by Alexander Soros\nJust cooler today and don't make a mockery of yourselves and pretend that you speak to the Jews in Pittsburgh when you get there saying you're not welcome I pray to God that you just for a few minutes have respect for the dead and don't use their dead bodies\nAs fuel for your horrendous agenda against the president and against most Americans by the way\nJust given a break for a day can you do that survivors huddle huddled in closet during synagogue attack terrible story I guess I should throw in what I said yesterday I spent three hours on this uh self defense self defense self defense self defense\nChristians Jews must learn how to use weapons they must learn to defend themselves I Know it's a shocking thing to say in a liberal democracy like ours over we're not that kind of notion while you would like not to be that kind of nation but we are\nYou need to learn to defend yourself the Israelis learned it can't just be done with love\nThey learn to have to tolerate in one hand and it was the in the other that's why they develop the ... some machine gun\nThey learn they needed a gun in one hand so the chief rabbi by the way of Israel was a paratrooper at the time remember that store he would parachute out of a a plane into a battle zone with a machine gun in his hand in a in the Bible and the other he learned he understood what it meant\nAnd so when we're going to learn I don't know when the average liberal in America comes to understand that someone else is not going to defend you you have to defend yourself\nMaybe they wouldn't have to huddling a closet maybe they could learn that they have to defend themselves as terrible as that may sound and if they don't want to do it then they have to hire armed guards I've been trying to warn people about this was Nineteen eighty to eighty one\nIt's only a matter of time I said you're throwing the dice sitting there like just waiting for a maniac to come in\nAnd it's happened before in the past it was um Islamic fanatics who killed Jews mercilessly chopped them up and go wanted them remember the Mumbai disaster you remember that one but because it was in India you know it came and went this one hit home because there was a white man who did it\nA craze Nazi type\nAnd so it fits the liberal agenda they've got someone to hate that they can hate with all their hearts when it was a Muslim who did it against the Jews that didn't fit the agenda that well and so they had to let it go a little bit they didn't focus so much on the perpetrators I mean it's there as the uh the the the slaughter in the gay nightclub they didn't focus on it\nThe other Florida they just always look the other way because it doesn't fit the bill left wing agenda I mean it's not clear if you're looking at it with open eyes you know it's hard to have open eyes open heart with all these news stories and you take it and you do it\nBack to come in and it's happened before in the past it was um Islamic fanatics who killed Jews mercilessly chopped them up and go wanted them remember the Mumbai disaster you remember that one but because it was in India you know it came in when this one hit home because there was a white man who did it\nA craze Nazi type\nAnd so it fits the liberal agenda they've got someone to hate that they can hate with all their hearts when it was a Muslim who did it against the Jews they didn't fit the agenda that well and so they had to let it go a little bit they didn't focus so much on the perpetrators I mean it's there as the uh the the the slaughter in the gay nightclub they didn't focus on it\nThe other Florida they just always looked the other way because it doesn't fit the bill left wing agenda I mean it's not clear if you're looking at it with open eyes you know it's hard to have open eyes open heart with all these news stories and you take it and you do it for a living is very difficult I had a tough time over the weekend after this happened it hit me very close and very hard\nAnd I brought everything that I could to the table yesterday but today we're talking about something that's entirely different\nWhich is we're not talking about so much about the gangsters hidden in the end and the women and children in a caravan of which we know there were several everyone knows that I mean if you were a if you were a gangster how would you come into the country you don't hide\nWhat would you walk in and say I'm a gangster and I want to deal drugs in America\nYou get in line with the thousands of them with the women and children you have to push the carriages in front of you and you get to separate the of the American people is they're all they're all just wanting to come in there all poor that's how you would do it\nSo it's slowing down on its own momentum is slowing down the momentum and that's because the president is speaking for most American people you may not know this\nForget the liars in the media who do this to incite hatred\nEvery poll one after the other no matter what the state shows that the largest majority of Americans even liberals do not want open borders they do not\nThis is a a a small percentage of radical fanatics funded largely by the billionaires like George Soros I guess I'm not allowed to mention his name anymore suddenly the victim all of a sudden after victimizing America for all these years with all of his money suddenly he's the victim\nHe funds let's see on the far east funded black lives matter he's fun to occupy groups to me that's not American by the way that's quite something else and he was thrown out of Hungary\nHe's not welcome in many European countries all George Soros because he tried to destroy their sovereignty as well they can all be Nazis what every Hungarian our loves their own country as a Nazi according to who George Soros they throw them out of out of Hungary for what he tried to do to that country\nThey closed the universities in some countries because of the Haiti was preaching against nationalities against the nation and nationalism\nAnd then there's another thing I said yesterday that should not be lost in the ether over the airwaves it's about so called white nationalists that's the new bogeyman white nationalist just say why to national together and immediately you have a boogie man you can hate right\nIf you live in a liberal community as white nationalist white ... white nationalist together it feels good when you say it doesn't it\nWhat is a white nationalist is not too broad a statement white nationalist\nSo if you're white and you believe in America and America's sovereignty\nWhat you're a Nazi now so look at every cross in every war memorials cemetery you're going to see an awful lot of white nationalist and they're going back to the revolutionary war the a lot of them were white most of them were white in the cemetery as a matter of fact that our military cemetery just population was and is and the military was comprised largely\nSo they should not be lost in the ether of the airwaves it's about so called white nationalist that the new bogeyman white nationalist just say why to national together and immediately you have a boogie man you can hate right\nIf you live in a liberal community as white nationalist white nationalist white nationalist together feels good when you say it doesn't it\nWhat is a white nationalist is not too broad a statement of white nationalist\nSo if you're white and you believe in America and America's sovereignty\nWhy you're not see now so look at every cross in every war memorial cemetery you're going to see an awful lot of white nationalist and they're going back to the revolutionary war see a lot of them were white most of them were white in the cemeteries as a matter of fact that our military cemetery just population was and is\nAnd the military was comprised largely of white people and what let's go back to World War two just for a minute\nSo most of the man who wore enlisted to fight many of them were fighting with he loved America not all but many war and so they fought why well they will nationalist they loved America and they didn't want to speak German\nThat simple so what they're white nationalist do so you know defined your terms a little clearer\nWhat you mean white nationalist what is it actually mean not every white person as a nationalist as a Nazi and yet to the left wing in America they've conflated the terms into having you know you can believe that anyone who is crowded the flag\nProud of the nation's history proud of the culture proud of the language is somehow a bad person\nThink very carefully before you smear whites with that label or else you'll fall down to the level of Jeff Zucker on CNN\nJoy both Savage

live local studios of life folk copy and if you love coffee in greater things you can stop by and say hello so tonight\nI wanted to get into some topics that\nMay be not the most um I don't know\nA tactful in certain ways but I I Want to frame it this way you know the British Nixon shows dedicated to\nEducation or getting the word out about great things going around in the valley that help the unborn the elderly and the infirm and tonight is no exception but the framework will be tonight I I Hope that\nYou do your listeners will be the gifts tonight I Want you to take a moment to write down this number and if you get the urge here in the second segment here in about ten minutes I Want you to call in and sharing feedback or not just the program but the subject as well\nThe number to write down tonight is six zero two two five four to five three five and that'll get you into the program we'll be able to talk to you and listen to your question indoor feedback again that six zero two two five four\nTo five three five the connection to camp and ex radio here on AM eleven hundred so the framework again in this a scheme of things Bruce Nixon life charities has\nReally created to talk about family we talk about faith and we talk about life issues again whether that be the um\nWe'll be tonight I I Hope that\nYou do your listeners will be the gas tonight I Want you to take a moment to write down this number and if you get the urge here in the second segment here in about ten minutes I Want you to call in and sharing feedback on not just the program but the subject as well\nThe number to write down tonight at six zero two two five four to five three five and that'll get you into the program\nWe'll be able to talk to you and or listen to your question indoor feedback again that six zero two two five four\nTo five three five the live connection to camp and ex radio here on am eleven hundred so the framework again in this a scheme of things Bruce Nixon life charities has\nReally created to talk about family we talk about faith and we talk about life issues again whether that be the unborn the elderly\nOr the firm and we spent last couple of weeks talking in great detail to John ... from lotus last ministries that helps women who are in a domestic violence or homeless situation who are also pregnant before or that the week before we talked to share Riley from\nEasier for the state to care for not to mention that you would make clinic workers nurses doctors\nAnd front desk clerks into ostensibly ice agents which doesn't stand to reason I mean would they be given these extra duty than extra pay probably not so this isn't just one example of what I mean by there are so many issues important to so many people\nAnd the Catholic Church has really led the way as far as getting information out there and having a consistent life ethic to the point where yes the teaching of the church is Clare state nations need their sovereignty but we also as individuals\nNeed to look at people and their plight and health care for them in a way that gives us the responsibility to live the attitudes and not the state herself and let me back that up a little bit and framed that so that I'm making sense what I'm saying is\nWhether it be helping the poor or the immigrant or the prisoner\nOr the naked or the hungry that's our personal responsibility they can't be deferred to the state by raising taxes you can't force people to be charitable and expect positive outcomes and so in this regard there are some challenges even within the body of the Catholic Church whereby\nA many bishops I'm not speaking for bishop bumps that here but many bishops have called for\nWhat I might label Episcopal fascism that melding of beautiful capitalism and you know horrifically um historically terrible socialism to create an economic fascism whereby you take from the rich and give to them\nBack that up a little bit and frame that so that I'm making sense what I'm saying is\nWhether it be helping the poor or the immigrants or the prisoner\nOr the naked or the hungry that's our personal responsibility it can't be deferred to the state by raising taxes you can't force people to be charitable and expect positive outcomes and so in this regard there are some challenges even within the body of the Catholic Church whereby\nA many bishops I'm not speaking for bishop bumps that here but many bishops have called for\nWhat I might label Episcopal fascism that melding of beautiful capitalism and\nYou know horrifically um historically terrible socialism to create an economic fascism whereby you take from the rich and give to the poor are on behalf of the government and not individuals or not I denounce status fake\nAnd I just want to remind everybody that regardless of your religious affiliation Jesus never said render unjust Caesar and let Caesar care for some people\nThat never happened All right\nA lot to go through like I said if you just tuned in you are listening to the Bruce Nixon show live here on AM eleven hundred the valleys independent talk radio station I Bruce Nixon and we're talking ... life ethics whether it be immigrants the caravan the unborn the elderly or the from\nIf you want to weigh in on this subject I'm gonna open up the phone lines here I'm just about four minutes so here's the number to call in if you want to chime in tonight at six zero two two five four to five three five again that six zero two two five four to five three five we've got um\nNot just immigration is an issue but the way that the government handles every aspect of your life there seems to be a movement underfoot whereby the nation the federal government has supplanted husbands wives nanny lovers\nAnd become that spouse that\nIn yesteryear we used to support one another in the family unit and so under the principle of subsidiary whereby the smallest unit ought to be strengthened so it can be self sufficient\nYou would look at it this way that the family mom dad kids to kids three kids five would be working hard to be strong cohesive unit and where there were many families gathered\nYou might imagine in years gone by that they formed a village in that village when it became strong in a somewhat self supportive and able to live on its own might grow into a town\nAnd over the years what's happened is we've gotten this grandiose idea that industrialists could create factories and put people into what I Would describe as a hive\nOr we have a hive mentality in our biggest cities where now instead of the smallest unit being strengthened and then creating larger unit we have these large high like environments where\nWe really do have some issues but back to subsidy or any for just a moment when the town and village grow into a small city and create what happened in territories and then stayed\nYou find that the states then down together to form well maybe not a perfect union but a fairly strong union\nAnd that has changed a lot since Lincoln and they ever or in the room Abraham Lincoln in the civil war and and there's lots to get into their but\nMy central point is\nWe need to get back to strengthening the family\nUh we have a hive mentality in our biggest cities where now instead of the smallest unit being strengthened and then creating larger unit we have these large high like environments where\nWe really do have some issues but back to subsidy or any for just a moment when the town and village grow into a small city and create what happened in territories and then stayed\nYou find that the states then down together to form well maybe not a perfect union but a fairly\nStrong union and that has changed a lot since Lincoln and they ever ah in the ... Abraham Lincoln in the civil war and and there's lots to get into their but\nMy central point is\nWe need to get back to strengthening the family and when we strengthen the family we can build like this little coffee shop is in ... village if this village could be a embolden by strong families instead of being one of the drug\nCapitals of Arizona then you might find that this village would thrive in a fashion that would be a model for the entire city\nHer I promised calls on the subject I Know we're going over a lot of territory tonight\nBut if you want to chime in is Bruce Nixon show here on him eleven hundred called six so two two five four to five three five and wildly let those phone lines light up hopefully there's all ten of you listening tonight I've just teasing I Wanna say special thanks to our main sponsor\nAnd that is part tree delicious foods and seasonings for your pets on the Web ad part tree dot com I was so last week by my manager a K wife that I might have sounded like poetry but it is in fact part treat like a dog park\nOr a cat's paw that P.

oh one C. three and will tell you how to get involved with that after the break at the bottom of the hour or are in these last few minutes before the break I Want to continue on this subject and get right into [noise]\nWhere are we with this great framework of a consistent life ethic\nWhere our one point million Catholics in Phoenix where what are your sediments here\nOn the breakdown in the global hierarchy and the American hierarchy I Know that we have a a very strong bishop here in the valley I've known bishop bumps that since he was in Wichita, Kansas\nHe did great things there and he's doing great things here unfortunately from my vantage point he's got\nA large body of dissidents underneath him and I'd like to hear what your thoughts are though on the global break down and the national breakdown\nOf Catholic hierarchy the cardinals the bishops\nAnd are they at odds with the way that you think uh regarding how we help the poor or the immigrants who are the unborn the elderly I'd love to hear from you about that if you're interested in entering into conversation comment six zero two two five four to five\nThree five or just a moment or two from the break but I Will say this\nHaving done this for so many years\nUp here in the valley I've known bishop bumps that since he was in Wichita, Kansas\nHe did great things there and he's doing great things here unfortunately from my vantage point he's got\nA large body of dissidents underneath him and I'd like to hear what your thoughts are though on the global break down and the national breakdown\nOf Catholic hierarchy the cardinals the bishops\nAnd are they at odds with the way that you think uh regarding how we help the poor or the immigrants who are the unborn the elderly I'd love to hear from you about that if you're interested in entering into conversation comment six zero two two five four to five\nThree five or just a moment or two from the break but I Will say this\nHaving done this for so many years I've met so many great people across the United states who believe\nIn not just the sanctity of life and helping people across the board but really believe in the idea of our republic\nWhich is really taking a hit you know I don't want to be too political because I think there's bad things on both sides of the left or right the red to blue the Democrats and Republicans but we really have to put our proverbial houses in order all politics are local I Hope you are all involved\nIn what's going on in the Arizona Senate race I Hope you're involved in the mayoral race here in Phoenix\nWherever locale you might be in all these issues get involved because even if let's just say you disagree with everything I've said and you don't really believe in a consistent life that they can you'd like to republic to turn into something else still like to hear from you but I Believe that we really have a core group of people\nWho in many respects have been so disenchanted by so many things that have happened in politics in the church\nThey and I've met many of them feel disenfranchised by both institutions by\nThe country and by the church and I'd like to be able to have a conversation and see where we can go with that in the meantime I guess it's almost time to get to the break I Want to say a special thank you to our good friend Justin in the booth\nAnd in about Ninety second bailout on you and in the meantime I'll let you know you can call in sick so two two five four to five three five we've got the news at the bottom of the hour six zero two two five four\nTo five three five we are so grateful you could be with us on the Bruce Nixon show tonight and if you or would like to call we'd love to hear from you\nAfter the break we're going to break down some really core issues and get into the Francis pontificate and what it means for American Catholics particularly when it comes to this election cycle there's a lot of issues at stake\nSort of a voter's guide on many of the issues will get into in the second half of the show and of course I continued to invite your calls tonight to tune in and listen to the Bruce Nixon show and participate maybe you're listening on line tonight at eleven hundred camp and X. dot com\nA lot of issues at stake sort of a voter's guide on many of the issues will get into in the second half of the show and of course I continued to invite your calls tonight to tune in and listen to the Bruce Nixon show him participate\nWhether you do that through your local small church or a small community effort and I'll give it for instance if Sonny slope or demand together and say we'd like to\nHave a little a meeting here and we'd like to\nBegin the idea of helping one another out in this community perhaps you could all me here one Saturday a month and we'll go clean up a park or well made here one Saturday a month and we'll go paint some old folks' house they can't get out and help themselves anymore [noise]\nOne Sunday we're going to gather or one Saturday a month we're going to gather and open a food kitchen and help the people that if you've been to sunny slope no are sleeping on the streets every night\nAnd the city initiatives that I've been privy to meetings here in my own coffee shop\nThere are something like sixteen different centers here in sunny slope between nineteenth avenue in twelfth street that have an extraordinarily high sixties maybe even Seventy percent vacancy rate\nBecause they're voluntary clean and sober facilities if you don't want to be clean and sober you're not going to get any help and those are city and county facilities\nAnd I get I think you get what I'm driving at if we could somehow band together as people\nAnd have people take care of people because bureaucrats don't tend to take care of people very well\nUh I don't know if anyone's ever had a great experience at the department of motor vehicles but if you have I'd love to hear from you as well and that's just a for instance\nObviously people have an infinite dignity because they're human and not because of what they can contribute and the problem with turning the government topsy turvy\nIs there comes a point at which if you're not productive\nAnd you're not paying taxes are putting into production in quite a literal sense and you become useless than you are expendable\nAnd I'm here to proper to you that that's not true you everyone has intrinsic dignity simply because they're human the people that are sleeping in the streets they have been a nuisance to many people aggressive panhandlers but there must be a way for us as people\nTo help those people\nAnd not just rely on a government that is and septic to step in and help in any meaningful way\nAll right if you just tuned in its forty one minutes after the hour just Nineteen Minutes to ten o'clock it's am eleven hundred the valleys independent talk radio it's the Bruce Nixon radio program I'm Bruce Nixon live\nIs there comes a point at which if you're not productive\nAnd you're not paying taxes are putting into production in quite a literal sense and you become useless then you are expendable\nAnd I'm here to proper to you that that's not true you everyone has in transit dignity simply because they're human the people that are sleeping in the streets they have been a nuisance to many people\nAggressive panhandlers but there must be a way for us as people\nTo help those people\nAnd not just rely on a government that is antiseptic to step in and help in any meaningful way\nAll right if you just tuned in it's forty minutes after the hour just Nineteen Minutes to ten o'clock it's am eleven hundred the valleys independent talk radio\nIt's the Bruce Nixon radio program I Bruce Nixon's live from the life of coffee studios right here at seventh street and done mapping Phoenix and I haven't heard from anybody yet maybe the phone lines broken I'm only teaching at six so two\nTwo five four to five three five six oh two two five four to five three five and if you've got\nAny of the issues that we've been talking about for the last thirty minutes or so\nThat you like to chime in on I'd love to hear from you in the meantime we'll progress I promised that we'd get into a segment about the ... the global church and the hierarchical failures\nAnd I don't want to sound like you know a Chicken Little that the sky is falling\nBut I think if you're observance of even reading the newspapers who does anymore if you've been reading the articles on line or listening to the main line news you know that the institutional church not the metaphysical body of Christ but the institutional church has got some serious issues\nRight up to and including the Holy Father and I know aiming to intent and the cat or offend any Catholics in the audience tonight it's just a simple matter of\nThe level of corruption in the way that the sex abuse scandals have been handled by cardinals in the east and west\nAnd the insidious nature of some of the\nI dunno modernist ideas that are being bandied about an hour introducing the idea that Henry the eighth would be an ex communicated because\nHe wasn't adults rating are divorced and remarried and living in adultery was just an irregular situation\nI think you can see what I'm getting at but my biggest beef here and I should tell me if that's your biggest beef too is way back in two thousand three when the Boston Globe first broke\nThis modern sex abuse scandal then Bernard Carter Cardinal Law was not um put on trial or put in jail he was given an arch priest duty and one of the five but silica in Rome by the late John Paul the second\nAnd to me that was a signal that if you're in a church position of power you're going to get away with little murder\nThing little holes that are murdered by this abuse of lifelong torture is a myth adventure and\nI'm not even sure how they go on to be Frank\nAnd the payouts Orange County California paid out something more than nine hundred million dollars over the last decade in sex abuse claims\nAnd again I'm not trying to beat down the teachings of the Catholic Church but these men in positions of power have seemed to be corrupted in a way that\nIt's not simple sin I mean anybody can sin repent but corrupt to think of all the cardinals that have gone down in flames and just the last few months ma Carrick world job and is going down some others that are being\nIf you're in a church position of power you're going to get away with little murder thing a little closer to murdered by this abuse of lifelong torture is a myth adventure and I'm not even sure how they go on to be Frank\nAnd the payouts Orange County California paid out something more than nine hundred million dollars\nOver the last decade in sex abuse claims\nAnd again I'm not trying to beat down the teachings of the Catholic Church but these men in positions of power have seemed to be\nCorrupted in a way that\nIt's not simple sin I mean anybody can sin repent but corrupt to think of all the cardinals that have gone down in flames and just the last few months Smith character world job and is going down some others that are being named from ... flying around it seems to me if you're paying attention\nThat the lord is cleaning house and getting ready to make some big changes institutionally and I'm all for it but out of this watching\nNo crimes no prosecutions none of this happening\nIt's really quite sad for the faithful who really have to then go through all these other issues that we're talking about because when I led the program by saying hey the Catholic Church is disseminated a consistent pro life ethic and stood up for the unborn and the elderly and the from the immigrant\nThe sad the dying all the above and then to turn around and have their leadership crash and burn and not just crash and burn but some have reported\nAnd I'm getting to the bottom of myself I'm looking to do some first hand interviews that this cabal of corruption may in fact the the the the body that helped elect the current parts of which puts us in a huge quandary\nBenedict is sixteen the pope who advocated his power as pope still lives in the Vatican still dresses in wide instill the fact is a pope and if this Pope Francis the um Argentinean wasn't fact\nElected by criminal ... ball\nDoes that eliminated pontificated as anti pope and so Pope Benedict is actually the real ...\nI think these are legitimate questions and ah\nI'd love to hear from you if you have some feedback we have about ten more minutes in the program and if you'd like to weigh in on the subject what your views are on the Catholic Church and not just the teachings but how we're handling this hierarchical structure because the pro life issues\nAre going to be hard pressed to keep going with if nobody trusts the leadership of the church give us a call six so two\nTwo five four to five three five six zero two two five four to five three five and\nBacking up just a little bit you know over the course of my time and religious broadcasting a lot of these things were going on and I was in\nTrouble in many places in my career for trying to report on issues because too many religious properties particularly in the Catholic vein relied on the bishops good favor to raise money and of course money is a sore subject ride I once told a bishop recently\nHave you ever been to collections\nAnd he looked at me kind of funny and I said he said well why would you ask me that\nI said well every Sunday Catholics good at math around the country and they take up a collection it's like you're sending them to collections every Sunday no one's talking about stewardship or any of these principles that we'd like to think that Bruce next to life charities would love to\nBacking up just a little bit you know over the course of my time and religious broadcasting a lot of these things were going on and I was\nIn trouble in many places in my career for trying to report on issues because too many religious properties particularly in the Catholic vein relied on the bishops good favor to raise money and of course money is a sore subject ride\nI once told a

country and they take up a collection it's like you're sending them to collections every Sunday no one's talking about stewardship or any of these principles that we'd like to think that Bruce next to life charities would love to styles and and help educate the general public with\nBut if you're going to collections every Sunday it seems to me the backward counter intuitive difference of\nThe ancient Jewish tradition of first fruits\nYou know of course they did hiding in the ancient Jewish tradition or giving one tenth of their first fruits and atonement for sin but in a strictly Catholics center Christian sense Christ paid the tide by dying on the crowd so we no longer obey tied in that sense\nBut the tradition of giving ten percent of first fruits or what you can give the ... first fruits is known as stewardship and I think\nIt's been glossed over and part of the problem of the power structure that's built on money and things and don't get me started 'cause I've been around this stuff for twenty five plus years and I could tell you horror stories but the main issue is\nHow do we consistently teach a pro life ethic and help the immigrants helps the unborn help the elderly and the disabled\nWithout true leadership\nSo again I'd love to hear from you tonight six so two two five four to five three five six oh two two five four to five three five you can weigh in on what your thoughts are on anything we've talked about this evening or your thoughts on what's going on within that the church that you'd like to see changed\nOr perhaps you'd like to be a part of change got

I pass by it practically every day of my childhood as I pointed that way to go to school it was a it was a fixture in the community which I grow up and you know interestingly enough Laura's there was a place where I first\nSaw aside that is a inspired me\nLately to focus on a related topic but it it was a sign that said said Soviet Jews and I've been thinking about it you know this was obviously not only an expression of ... you know what people face\nDo with their best which just care about others but it is a reminder now that a committee that your story about Jews and the Soviet Union now has to like Jews in Europe or even worry about you know there are safety in our own country and this is a very very\nBad side of what has been happening in terms of uh the rising not only anti Semitism but anti Israel\nSentiments are and more generally uh I I think I have a hatred for people who are art of a well frankly are primarily art of the left or archery as supremacists or often allied with the left at that's a that's\nA very worrying as I say statement about what's happening in our country more broadly\nBecause you warned us for a long time that uh with the rise of sharia law in in various places in the middle east with a hint of it at least in part to Western Europe like friends and even in England that we worry hear about\nAnd this is a very very bad you know side of what has been happening in terms of ah the rising not only anti Semitism but uh anti Israel\nSentiments a and and more generally uh I I think I have a hatred for people who are art of a well frankly are primarily art of the left or or archery as the premises so or often allied with the left and that's a that's\nA very worrying as I say statement about what's happening in our country more broadly\nYeah because you warned us for a long time that uh with the rise of sharia law in in various places in the middle east with a hint of it at least in part to Western Europe like France\nAnd even in England that we worry here about ... you know handing out offensive\nLeaflets or or uh you know they they'll go in and they'll they'll vandalized a synagogue a but we don't often hear about people literally committing murder all those Seattle at a murder that was aimed at a Jewish citizens are not too many years ago\nAnd I guess I just wonder are people aware that that that is going to seem small by comparison ... takes rude because under surreal law are both Christians and Jews are are going to be a are going to be a uh the the targets of that one night and I also want you to tie in with answering why you think\nThere may have been a a really dramatic rise in the number of of active anti Semitism and hatred toward Jews lately\nOr has there been well I think there are reportedly up for it certainly in Europe\nIt's on the shake up all and I think that has an awful lot to do Lars with the rising\nPresence and increasingly in both the attitude of uh these shows is the premises you know they've they've poured into Europe but by the millions [noise] I'm not all Muslims are sure is a process as we've talked about\nAre we talking about a subset of them but unfortunately there are there are hundreds of millions of people who believe that this uh ... brutally repressive anti Semitic\nAssad should stick homophobic or\nYou know intolerant doctrine of authoritative Islam is a is being practiced increasingly in Europe and it's creating I think an environment that's dangerous they're much as we're seeing in other parts of the world it's a it's it's dangerous for both Jews and Christians and as I said\nThat sign outside the synagogue a tree of life that squirrel hill\nCommunity of Pittsburgh inspired an effort that I've been involved in a\nCoal to save the persecuted Christians coalition and we're looking at in addition to what genes are experiencing a two hundred and Fifteen million Christians around the world are being heavily persecuted I don't mean they're just having a hard time getting a job or\nYou know people are unpleasant to the I'm Talking about people are being tortured or raped or a driven from their homes or a crucified or or\nMurder on mass and that is part and parcel of what's going on it's not just let me be clear and it's not just Islam is who are doing it but an awful lot of them are are beating the state at the

prophet Mohammed exercising her freedom of speech which he has the right to do with that constitutionally guaranteed as here but even in Europe you have a right\nUnder their you know human rights convention to speak but apparently according to the court not if you offend\nOthers religious feelings as they put it well that's a real blast with me and that is the leading edge of the effort to force a you know a civilization to submit to this surgery a\nDoctorate in program it ...\nIt is very uh let me throw another idea at you and this one is one I just just occurred to me as you were speaking about that Frank\nYou remember how we worried over the last couple of years did the Soviet Union tried to use Facebook and other social media or it's not sort of you and your Russia or did they use it to try to change the outcome of an election and we also while their their efforts were kind of puny\nUh but you know we don't want people doing that anyway or having a foreign power trying to interfere with their elections\nI heard the discussion the other night that was talking about the fact that an awful lot of these anti Semite like Robert Bowers or you know the guy who said do all the Jews must die as he was being taken into custody in synagogue on Saturday they've been pushed off can most conventional social media\nBecause social media sites like Twitter and Facebook say we don't want you on your so they've gone to other alternative ones that are more\nYou know wild wild west when it comes to you can say anything you want and they said that's you know in some ways that's good because it gets them away from the conventional sites where most of the people are focusing their social media but his bad in the sense that they almost disappeared from public view until they pop up doing something like what Robert Bowers is accused of doing\nAnd it occurred to me if you were in the middle east and you are a ... law you know a a proponent or at here and and you said how can we screw things up in America and how can we advance our cause because they clearly hate Israel and hate the Jewish people\nOne of the ways they might do it and they could do it from a distance would be to get on social media and encourage the Robert ... hours of the world couldn't they but does anybody even looking for that phenomena\n[noise] I I think people are are perhaps not enough and or maybe not aggressively enough but let me just add something to to round out what you've said you hours because it seems to me that\nIt's at least as problematic that a while or the social media platforms that Google's the Facebook's the twitters and so on are are migrating the Robert Bauer his office there pages on the grounds that they're saying violent or hateful things\nOf a proponent for

while or the social media platforms that Google's Facebook's the twitters so on are are\nMigrating the Robert power's off of their pages on the grounds that they're saying violent or hateful things they're also using the Southern Poverty Law Center which is a political warfare instrument of the left to try to keep people like\nAuthority to extend the citizenship to whomever it lives\nBut it's never acted to extend citizenship this far and so\nA really this could be corrected today tomorrow\nIt doesn't need an amendment to the constitution as many\nPeople who have objected to the rumor is about what President Trump is planning to do it doesn't actually required amendments of the constitution the changes is it's really been I'm mistaken application of the fourteenth amendment by the other branches that has given us this problem\nWell if there's no statutory law to speak on this and there is the amendment\nAnd all it takes the bureaucracy to behave differently as you said\nThe passport office or any other government agencies that takes into account where you are what what country you're a citizen of primarily the state department than it is within the president's power to say stop issuing passports or any other documents to people who are not citizens fiber right\nAnd and then the economy I understand it would actually what what we have is we have a a statute eight USC fourteen or want it simply repeats the language of the fourteenth amendment including saying subject to the jurisdiction there up and it's been executive application or you could say miss application of this language\nIt's given us the current problem and the president\nWanted to correct it I don't see any reason why he couldn't correct it of course what we've seen\nDuring the Trump Administration is that federal judges a hostile to the president have\nFloored at his attempts to exercise in the legitimate authority in connection with in resume aggressive foreign people so I suppose we could expect to kind of blow up in the lower federal courts about this if the president acted on it but it could well be that now there are five votes on the Supreme Court to uphold his decision\nIn this case\nStand it would actually what what we have is we have a a statute eight USC for Tina one it's simply with teach the language of the fourteenth amendment including saying subject to the jurisdiction there other than it's been executive application or you could say miss application of this language\nIt's given us the current problem it's president\nWanted to correct it I don't see any reason why he couldn't correct it of course what we've seen during the Trump Administration is that federal judges a hostile to the president have\nForwarded his attempts to exercise a legitimate authority in connection with in resin ... foreign people so I suppose we could expect to kind of blow up in the lower federal courts about this if the president acted on it but\nIt could well be that now there are five votes on the Supreme Court to uphold his decision\nWell and in this case that law was written I think in fifty two and the other one we spend a lot of time with I think it was the McCarron act was written in fifty five do you think that the legislative history is it the members of Congress in Nineteen fifty to\nAll the way back to what are we talking about our eyes and our the tail fell into you know I think it would be Eisenhower at that point when it was a true motives\nFifty twos Truman yeah of course we have there's a general rule in in the law that where you have a language that's been used before being repeated it should be understood as having the same meaning so what that would mean as if\nIf the Congress uses language directly from the fourteenth amendment we should understand the language of the Congress has used as having the same meaning as it had in the fourteenth amendment which gets back to what I was saying before about what the chief author and another one of the most prominent are proponents or in Congress said this this phrase\nAllergies subject to the jurisdiction there are men and again what they said it meant was that the person in question didn't ... any allegiance to any foreign stage so that would not cover uh foreigners without cover anchor babies that would not cover birth terrorists that would not cover any of these people\nKnow and in fact you could start applying that right now although I Wonder about the practical application\nBecause he's at today's practical application if a\nIf a South Korean mom flies into Los Angeles or Seattle stays for a few weeks delivers a baby and goes home she likely goes home with a birth certificate from the state of California which is a sanctuary state so does that become definitive of what and who that child is\nOr is it the U.S government's policy at the time they were born the definitive because they go home to South Korea with mom and the kid turns Eighteen and then says okay mom\nI'm headed back to America since I'm a citizen does it matter what what we said today or does it matter what the policy is Twenty years from now or Eighteen years from now when the kid comes back to America hoping to establish himself and then at some point bring six or eight of his family members with her\n[laughter] well this is the kind of question that in a law professor was given to find out how to try to try to answer of course the the legal answer I think is that that doesn't matter but the practical answer is well\nI'm the president Eighteen years from now could order that he'd be given a passport so on the other hand of course\nYou think Hillary willing to be running Eighteen years from now [noise] I mean she's running right now I think so why not\nWell ahead of a

ago he put forth a a Seventy point plan of how to fix immigration Democrats wouldn't come to the table eventual that down to four main pillars are the Democrats\nShut down the government over there were few to address that\nIssue in any reasonable rational or sane way and so the president said look I've got to look at my powers under the constitution the full power I can I can execute from the executive branch that is legal\nTo try and solve the problems that we face that are decades old the Democrats will come to the table we have a crisis at our border that's been there for a while and

the program to national Sousa who we always mentioned is a best selling author and a film maker of several fantastic documentaries I've seen all of them so many great books and most recently death of a nation which is on DVD now\nBut one of the other things we've talked about before dinner ... long time ago is that you're an immigrant to this country illegal immigrants to the United states of America now an American citizen who's worked for president or a president and you've done some great things I Want to know your thought on the president saying\nWe have in misinterpreted the fourteenth amendment to the constitution for a hundred years and he wants to straighten it out and I think he's picked the right ... mechanism that will eventually bring it to a court case what's your ...\n[noise] well I take is that he is um uh he is picking up a topic where people have taken something to be all be at that is in no way out here\nAre the line with the constitution only about what are the most of the quotes that all born I'm being upgraded a you know a bunch of different ways including the fact that you know a lot of the life of area and now I don't need to be sort of\n... picky about it but I think that\nIt makes a point when he says listen without it probably did not in hand from Italy they'll put them can cross the border deliver a kid and boom is they get that he or she is a U.S citizen for life that was probably about what they had in mind and so yeah I don't I think it's a really good issue for him to test before the Supreme Court\nAnd over the years it didn't actually I've been on this hobby horse for about Twenty one years and all admitted it's been something that has bothered me I started talking about it on the radio about Twenty one years are going to say the fourteenth amendment I read all the history or read the various legal pieces about it I'm not a lawyer\nBut I said this this was the wrong way to interpret it illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states they've entered the country illegally should\nUh not so of course as a whole life has area and now I don't mean to be sort of ... picky about it but I think Trump is\nIt makes a point when he says listen the found it probably did not intend to some illegal person can cross the border deliver a kid and boom they get the he or she is a U.S citizen for life that was probably you know what they had in mind and so yes I don't I think it's a really good uh issue for him to test before the Supreme Court\nAnd over the years I've been on this hobby horse for about Twenty one years and all admitted it's been a something that has bothered me I started talking about it on the radio about Twenty one years are going to say the fourteenth amendment or I read all the history of read the various legal pieces about it I'm not a lawyer\nBut I said this this is the wrong way to interpret it illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states they've entered the country illegally should we automatically grant that we've created moral hazard like birth birthplace her birth writes a tourism where people literally fly into the country have a baby and then\nFly home saying there's our little retirement plan right they're all wrapped up in ... glows\nAnd he'd say well this has to get fixed in every lawyer I talked to said\nWell there's not really a good legal mechanism to bring a case or challenge it in court but now the president has found its own unique way to say if I pass if I sign this executive order you can almost guarantee that by the end of the week there's going to be a court challenge and then we'll actually see what the Supreme Court says about\nExactly and it's clean feeling some lined up the court as a little different than\nIn the past any part of what the left doesn't ... relations as that they use the kind of struggle to shoulder with that because of the pose the helplessness a to create a situation which politically benefit them um but\nUh that's why I think Trump is showing a certain kind of bold miss on all the fun of it even Reagan didn't show in the eighties or so for me it's always a fascinating exercise to move back and forward in time because it's you know I became a conservative as maybe you'll get life in the Reagan Era\nAnd I think I'm ... voice for next active as successful as me\nI have to admit that didn't actually for the longest time I was kind of a political not that\nI wasn't interested in it but it was a reporter I kept my opinions out of my story is not had personal opinions that I Would say but I was always careful to keep them out\nSo for a lot of people they they looked at me on TALK radio a long time ago and so you're a conservative or you're not a liberal you worked in television I said yeah I had my own opinions but I kept him out of my work 'cause that was my job at the time\nI'm ... I Want you to describe depths of the nation your most recent documentary which now out on DVD and why people should go out and get it now that it's available in that form\nWell because um we talk a lot about fake news so we don't talk enough about six scholarship and fake history and steak narrative\nIn the last makes accusations against Trump and the conservative party sample they say Trump is a fashion the Republican Party is the party of fascism behind that is a kind of meta narrative a big story and the story is that fascism is on the right\nBack at them as as are likely to nominate fascism boycotted likely for all that and that whole argument would collapse and that notion fascism as directly phenomenon that's been something that left at all\nSince the Nineteen forties they've got it into the\nTextbooks that got it on the History Channel they've got it in the wake of media and so a lot of people will know it\nCould be true even though it's not true of fascism was never seen on the right prior to that\nBut what we're seeing is aggressive his story album that have been a kind of lab and all of us are sort of have to have an ... I watched the movie is to try to do that of a nation is Rick you out of that law so you'll history Isaac was actually experienced by the people who live through it and that\nTrump is a fascist the Republican Party is the party of fascism behind that is a kind of ... a big story and the story is that fascism is on the right back at them as as are likely to nominate it's actually more likely for novel and this whole argument would\nCollapse and that know fascism as directly phenomenon has been something that left at old\nSince the Nineteen forties they've got it into the\nTextbooks that got it on the History Channel they started in the wake of media and so a lot of people grow to know to\nBe true even though it's not true fascism was never seen on the right prior to that\nBut what we're seeing is regressive his story obviously that have\nBeen a kind of lab and all of us are sort of have to have an ... I watched the movie is try to do that the nation is Rick you out of that law show you a history as it was actually experienced\nBy the people who live through it in their twenties and thirties are kind of fresh look at our own American story so when you see it in a new like you'll never be the type of pain but got\nNo in fact I think that's true of all the documentaries you've done and I cite them frequently in conversations with people and say go watch this documentary and understand the real relationship this store relationship between say the United states and Mexico where our current relationship is a little bit strained\nBut some of that may go back in history but some of it was settled a long time ago in the United states I think acted very honorably in his relations toward a much less powerful\nA state of Mexico back in the day\nAnd and and we suddenly you're your own country great uh but but then you have to be responsible for your people\nYes absolutely so the movie and I do typically a book that goes with the movie um the movie has is an emotional narrative it\nIs it's hard for them firing the book has been on the references and first I was so it's kind of way of putting out a one two punch and the left has not been able to focus single hole and to this day like do they screen in general\nAnd misrepresent what out domestic claiming that Hitler was a liberal Democrat nonsense I'm not saying that it's not even remotely what I'm saying but what I Am saying is that if you're looking for the vestiges of fascist tactics in America today you'd be far more likely to find them on the left and on the right\nOne in fact aren't most I mean many of the policies that are being pushed by the most radical elements of the Democratic party including a ... and Gillum and others use lunchtime nationalized healthcare let's do this you know and it's a lot of policies that they weren't the much take over the world policies\nOf the Hitler regime but they certainly are socialist policies and I always like to remind them what Nazi actually stands for\n[noise] yeah I mean what is the part of the ...\nThink back to fascism and not and we think of World War two and got to stand there and and while those did come out of the war over fascism was not was not\nPortrayed like that that's not has a fascist became\nThe largest political party both in Germany and then in an earlier in Italy or they became the largest party by hand painting on government takeover of the bank and healthcare government control of education is an element control not only of the organs of the economy but\nAlso over the life of citizens that would be molded in a kind of a single unit\nAre marching in lockstep if you will lift\nLeft his ideology that's what the Nazis coast\nLifestyle song meaning and in a sense coordination and that's what the left are trying to do in their own way in America today beat us all into submission intimidate us all and just sitting in the same tune innocent flying our own plastic I fly off the overall balconies\nIt'll be interesting to see what happens after the midterms a week from today dinners congrats on ... of the nation it's now on store shelves anywhere DVDs are sold it didn't actually it's always a pleasure to have your own thing 'cause her down to that is diminished\nJust like any on government takeover of the bank and health care about them in control of education and things like that one man could not only the organs of the economy but also with the light of it is and that was eating mold and kind of a single unit I'm like sitting in law will last leftist\nIdeology that's what they're not east coast like so many in a sense coordination and that's what they're trying to do in their own way in America today that's all it just said yes and then in the day that's all at the same to you and then\nLying our own fly over our balcony\nWell it'll be interesting to see what happens after the midterms a week from today didn't ask congrats on ... of the nation it's now on store shelves anywhere DVDs are sold it didn't actually it's always a pleasure to have you on thank you sir that you\nThat is the national issues are the best selling author and filmmaker I Want to remind you of something that's very very practical it's about sleep how does a great night sleep improve your performance I can tell you how about more energy less brain far better mood and more productivity\nI work twelve or Thirteen hours a day that he was sleeping number three sixty smart bet it helps people like me to get great performance every day my sleep numbered setting a sixty five ten is is more like a thirty five or forty a much softer mattress so many couples disagree the sleep number bed let you choose your ideal furnace\nMillion people are more simultaneously I don't think they like that very much\nYeah I think he is taught the mainstream media a lesson and I think he's taught the American public a lesson not\nTo trust the mainstream media so clearly the president made an Enron around the media conservative talk radio and what you do you been doing it for\nA long time we launched NRA TV um you know before the president burst out of the scene but that was under the same model that we we were not getting our message out at our age mainstream media channels certainly not a nice pair of fashion so we said you know ... that work\nAnd and so we did the same thing that people are set up with hearing lives with urine propaganda with with hearing hatred simply because somebody disagrees with them and you talked earlier about\nUh the violent rhetoric\nI have not heard one Republican Lars that view that does not denounced violence does not that now's a rioting has not announced\nBreaking the law yet it is only Democrats that either enable them to do this ... to do that you hear so many mayor said well we need to give them room to riot you're not going to hear a Republican or conservative say that now and it's only the Democrats that pushed that\nI'm Talking to ... who's a host for enter a TV you might remember him as the guy who smashed the TV that was showing liberal news and I'm sure grants that will be brought back up when they decide to tar and feather you for your violent actions which were merely to convey a you know convey a message and of course at the same time\nIt's with hearing propaganda with with hearing hatred simply because somebody disagrees with them and you talked earlier about uh the violent rhetoric\nI have not heard one Republican Lars if you that does not denounced violence does not that now's a rioting has not announced breaking the law yet it is only Democrats that either enable them to do this exit amounted to that you hear so many mayor said well we need to give them room to riot\nYou're not going to have a Republican or conservative say that you know and it's only the Democrats that pushed that\nI'm Talking to ... who's a host for enter a TV you might remember him as the guy who smashed\nThe TV that was showing liberal news and I'm sure grants that will be brought back up when they decide to tar and feather you for your violent actions which were merely\nTo convey a you know convey a message and of course at the same time not acknowledge that they've done things like you know showing image of Paul Ryan allegedly throwing somebody off of a ... off a cliff in a wheelchair you know because that was that was an okay message but smashing\nAn inanimate object that's pure evil\nYou know I Want to tell you it was one of the most fun shoots I've ever been on and I've been in t._v. for a long time background as mainstream media was an investigative reporter for ran for Congress and that got in a talk radio and working at enter a TV and that was the most part I had so what we did for people that I hadn't seen it as we played clips of\nBobby deceitful media saying horrible things about the n._r._a. and the president and conservatives our race as far as that all these things and it pulls out with me wearing a T shirt that says socialist tears and I have a sledgehammer\nAnd I smashed the TV and I had to look really mean right while doing it but it was the hardest thing because we're laughing middle of this thing at the GPS going fly at all we did is what the left doesn't do we smashed all owned property we pay for all property we didn't do it to anybody else property you know what the brilliant part of that video was last time I didn't say a word\nAnd we did not have a gun and they still went ballistic over at no guns do speech nothing and of course they said we were being violent were not being violent we were just acting out what everybody wants to do they want to smash their TV when they're tired of being hammered over the head with nonsense every\nNight I'm Talking to ... hosted in or a TV you know one thing that bothers me a grant the fake news doesn't all have to come in statements of of of\nUntrue facts you can also come by omission and you know when I heard about the shooting at the synagogue on Saturday I was following Twitter and I thought oh my God this is horrible I said a prayer for those people but I also thought about my friend John Lott who runs a crime prevention Research Center\nWho points out that Ninety eight percent of all the mass shootings in American I'm tired of hearing about them to I Want them to stop\nBut they happen in gun free zones now I I didn't do a full\nCatalogue of what network news did but I'm willing to bet the not a single one mentioned these mass shootings happened in places that are disarmed and then make the very simple point\nShe I mean if a reporter at a network I ever had the inclination say\nHow do we protect the important stuff and he ... he or she just went through his day and said well I went to a ball game at the stadium the other day and there were armed cops or guards there\nAnd went to a shopping mall armed guards the building I mean right now armed guards most banks aren't you know go right down the list lots and lots of places the important places are protected by that well\nI've always thought the schools in houses of worship should be protected as well not by government edict but voluntarily\nThan it when you decide not to do that it's like me deciding not to wear my seatbelt I'm not blaming the victim I'm just saying I wear my seatbelt even though I've never had a seatbelt saved me from Syria's arm but also where gun every day even though I've never had that saved me from serious harm yet\n... that's right but you never know when it's ...\nArm and then make the very simple point\nShe I mean if a reporter at a network I ever had the inclination say how do we protect the important stuff and he he or she just went through his day and say well I went to a ball game at a stadium the other day and they were armed cops or guards there\nAnd went to a shopping mall armed guards the building I mean right now armed guards most banks aren't you know go right down the list lots and lots of places the important places are protected by that well\nI've always thought the schools in houses of worship should be protected as well not by government edict but voluntarily\nThen when you decide not to do that it's like me deciding not to wear my seatbelt I'm not blaming the victim I'm just saying I wear my seatbelt even though I've never had a seatbelt saved me from Syria's arm but also where gun every day even though I've never had that saved me from serious harm yet\n... that's right but you never know when it's going to happen you never know what you're going to get a car accident you'd never know if you're going to get out and said if you will comes calling and so I'm with you\nI mean my goal is to empower every single person that wants to carry a firearm law in a law abiding fashion to have the right to do so so many places are trying to take away that way but\nThat's all the second amendment is about is protecting yourself and your family so you have a right to do that and as soon as the liberals can realize the second amendment as Elvis orders hold on it is not going away\nAnytime soon the quicker they need to get over the hurdles of of trying to live in the status of the world or some al evil doesn't doesn't exist and so I'm with you about the line by omission gun free zones are dangerous and you can see this in every single news story that you either read or see on TV it's what they\nDon't tell you in the story that is really is really the uh the deceitful Mets adds\nThat the the dog is that's the dog doesn't bark want her grandson field on enter a TV and granted it's always great talking to you thanks so much hold on for

are\nTax increases and I don't like tax increases at all any kind of a tax increase tariffs make everything more expensive terrorists make\nEverything that you and I buy more expensive now people who argue or for what the president is doing a a\nThrowing down these terrorists not just against China but Europe or Canada Mexico I'm a number of countries around the world the argument kinda goes well\nThey're treating us unfairly so what Trump's got to do with these terrorists is punch them back a little bit and then they'll uh\nThey'll begin to treat us more fairly like they make it more expensive for our products to go into their country so what we have to do is make it more expensive for their products to come into this country\nThe bottom line oil and all of this is all of this makes everything you and I buy more expensive\n\nAs our secretary of agriculture Sonny Perdue um\n\nCame out today talking about dairy farmers dairy farmers in America are asking for more aid or as Trump's terrorists are wiping away almost a billion dollars in profits\nAnd again I Know there are plenty of people who believe a look Joe uh yeah we're going to have to suck it up for a while Trump scout upon these people in the head with these terrorists and then once they come around and everything will be All right so\nTo come into this country\nThe bottom line now and all of this is all of

while\nTrump scout upon these people in the head with these terrorists and then once they come around and everything will be All right so we got to just suck it up a little bit well you've got American farmers and American employers um sucking up big time\nA U.S in dairy farmers\nHave been caught just one example of a group of people who've been caught in the middle of a President Trump's\nEscalating trade war 'cause that's what it is that's what he's doing with several countries um these dairy farmers now are pleading for more\nCash welfare corporate welfare from the government because Trump's tariffs cost them\nThese dairy farmers about a billion dollars in profits since may in a letter sent to the agriculture secretary the national milk producers federation chairman and dairy farmer Randy Mooney\nSaid that the first round of subsidies issued an August has done little to compensate for last sales in lower milk\nPrices you should recall right that when Trump laid down all these tariffs or early on in the summer he also announced what twelve billion dollars in a government\nAid I e\nCorporate welfare\nFor people in this country farmers in this country negatively impact about Trump's by\nTrump's tariffs I mean think about that for a minute if this were Obama we'd be going ballistic Trump's Trump lays down sheriff's\nThey hurt American farmers so then the government uh comes in and gives are farmers a bunch of aid so that they can survive Trump's sheriffs\nTell me how that makes sense can somebody telling me how that makes sense\nWell it looks like the the twelve billion dollars in government welfare or that we extend to do our farmers this summer wasn't enough\nAnd now the especially our dairy farmers now are asking for more\nNot wildly USDA has made more than four point seven billion dollars available to farmers that started in September\nUm it's brought about one point two billion dollars worth of surplus food or the one hundred and twenty seven million of that\nWhich has been allocated for dairy farmers would only pay such farmers twelve cents per one hundred pounds of milk or on half of this year's

that's what it is our dairy farmers need more help from our government because of our government's policies\nTell me how that makes sense Joseph cookies with senior dairy analyst or he he noted that the terrorists\nAre also coming at a time when the U.S farm gate milk margins have remained at the lowest levels seen in the year for most of twenty Eighteen\nThe impacts of Trump's tariffs will continue to exacerbate lower margins for an industry seen a high rate of retirement from small dairy farmers\nAre the significant loss of profits\nA two hour dairy farmers are from both China and Mexico China is the largest importer of us way and Mexico is the largest importer of U. S. cheese\nSo\nJust just a little bit of a real world back in front of us again\nUm\nI I hear you and I I understand the argument that well hopefully a what a Trump say Trump came out last week and said what church there are no terrorists I think Trump just thought maybe he was just gonna he's just threatening\nAh other countries by a enacting\nTariffs ... when I don't know that Trump fully realized that he did literally enact\nTerrorists um and I get the argument that uh some of these countries treat us unfairly and what do you ... and and what are you can do about that\nI understand

that's what that's the way we've provided a daily dose of those products gray sure\nI've got a question that came in the first half of the program today and the customer list or wanted to know the the CBD stopped progression of chronic joint pain or or does it just treated symptomatic like can you address that worth\nIt does treated symptomatic ... however uh there's a lot of study starting to emerge that shows that uh\nThe chronic joint pain whether it's from our a bone D. generation\nCalcium degeneration osteoarthritis all these different things are usually a direct result of inflammatory long term and cemetery or chronic inflammation\nSo it does work with it it it does it absolutely stop it we don't know that yet there's just not enough science for the duration of science isn't long term enough to know that\nBut in the science showing that there's bone regroup authors recalculate occasion there's Reed strengthening of bones expensive where there's a bone break you can actually feel the it healed stronger faster\nFor elderly patients so yeah there's a lot of benefits to the bone we think the beauty and the bone wreak growth in in strength is a viable in long term option for patients\nFace time we appreciate that one of the other things of a part of that question\nIs um it depends on the cause of the chronic joint pain as a dietary with too much sugar is it a you know a chemical imbalance in her body so a lot of it depends on the uh the source of the inflammation and pain that they're experiencing what's been your comment\nYeah it's always the source you know something's causing inflammation and inflammation or if it's chronic and long term enough is going to break down your system\nWhat happens with the the video that it is they support mechanism is the modulator of your system it's not an active either of your system a lot of people will look at it you know how it relates to the receptor site\nWhat is really doing it it's going to the receptors like in modulating so if it's a hyperactive receptor become the town if it's under performing that brings it up it brings you back to homeostasis through many functions and and the thumbs within the body\nTo be sure to bring up the farm bill act uh we've had\nDiet cherry with too much sugar is it a you know a chemical imbalance and our body so a lot of it depends on the uh the source of the

brings it up it brings you back to homeostasis through many functions and and the thumbs within the body\nTo be sure to bring up the farm bill act uh we've had a lot of questions from our\nAudience a number of different issues coming up so can you kinda update us on the farm bill act\nYeah the farm bill act is what's gonna make hemp legal in the in the United states we've done in a pilot program for the last four years now I'm at the expiration of that pilot program was actually September thirtieth both the house and Senate have moved builds all the way through they've been in session\nOr they came to a conclusion on September thirtieth that they were going to decide a law that makes him legal and possibly schedules all the ... ads\nSchedule one drugs so that's very exciting news after the election that Senate the house will get together and really come up with the long term law or what him in all its constituents can do and what how we can build a doubted than in the good news for everybody Harry Good that's so wonderful to hear right answer\nIs no question about that Todd and uh I wanted to get back to the source thing a lot of our customers want to know where does it come from and uh you know we there they're concerned about feeling a drug test they're concerned about becoming addicted to it and I said mine are days when I say look let's talk about the source gene\nHow the CBD and give us a little bit more insight on that child\nWell in order for you to legally buy the product or manufactured products you are suppose to buy it from a state registered state a state compliance a\nProvider of him and the oil or the isolates from that plant Colorado have that many any ... any state that has an agricultural department that has civically set up to give oversight for the industry you want to buy from those states as the source\nA lot of people are sneaking around they're getting their DVD from other sources you can smell it if it smells like marijuana the sources marijuana as it smells earthy in like dirt\nThat temp you know it's much more wheat grass pipes smell the chirping profile alone had belong okay so you'll notice you smell alone but look at the

therapy ultrasound I've got one isn't a tens and all these different modalities that go along with her project mobilization\nTheir share it with me that is just blowing their mind that the patients responding favorably to all avenues of treatment have you heard this from your customers\nAbsolutely and I tell a I tell to the chiropractor that are adverse to that and aren't interested in I said if you don't employ that's in your practice and use it as support tool your customers are going to someone else you're gonna be out of business eventually\nOne of the test markets that we have that in the were chiropractors and massage therapists and that to the port in the result of their treatment last much longer and they get a much higher return rate from their customers for for the better experience over all the better therapy overall\nAnother trick was as we wanted to know how the chiropractor and there was lots of their result when they use a topical we knew that their hands were less if they were led fatigue at the end of the day they were able to perform better at their own jobs so they didn't even realize what's happening to them until you actually ask them how is your

I don't\nMind being confronted I really don't but here's one thing that I tell everybody and I told this morals group I tell them when I meet somebody the truth is a better sale\nThe ... who wouldn't want to tell the truth will anybody's tried it for a decade or maybe let's say a day or week or a month or a year tank now there's something called discretion 'cause everybody doesn't need to know everything but anyway now you know why so are\nAre they having invited me back\nNow other places have\nWith the uh full knowledge of how that little interview went down who knows the best things ever

you say ... is a constant rotation which is what the institutional buyers and sellers do you can't play with the institutional buyers and sellers\nSo when somebody tells me that they made three or four hundred percent on the money that is a\nJoke [laughter] to joke because they made thousands of present on you that's why I tell everybody\nOr anybody wants to listen you can manage your own money

I Want to do for something some online money\nAnd uh uh that was kind of how it started but actually started with I Need to pay my rent [laughter]\nYeah and then it went from there it's it's impossible now are my\nCitizen journalist or investigator said it's impossible to be able to see how much is actually multiply but we did the math because I had some good mathematicians so bitcoin

computers can't be done what we've done\nOr two hundred times the coin you can do the math let's do the math on that real quick let's grab our calculators game just to let you know what's coming down the pike so to speak okay so let's just take our little sixty three hundred and multiply that by two hundred\nSo when the stock market gets a hold of it or the exchange and they start trading it like a commodity\nAnd then they leverage it a hundred two hundred times you're looking at sixty three hundred times to hundreds of million two hundred and sixty thousand\nWhich may bam that's the value\nAnd then they're going to start all these little farms and then what happens people start putting money into the bonds they buy it start buying\nInto the bonds and then before you know it wow\nThat's going to be of a fun day to see how it rolls out really is going to be a lot of fun to see what really happened out of all this going to be some really exciting news or positioning ourselves so if you want to buy with us you can you can go to four to four\nThree five to one eight six nine that was a fun trade this morning watching that and the I'm not going to tell you who's it was\nBut uh you know it's so fun to be a part of it six hundred thousand dollars\nIs was the the value of that little a fund\nSo to speak with that they went out and buy it's not really a fun so it's like a buying account so they went out in the buying of Camp Six hundred thousand they bought Ninety thousand dollars worth of the coin eighty four coins per was eighty four coins watched it go up a couple of hundred dollars in Beckham oh wow it was that fast\nWent up bam\nBack is again what are we looking at right now and then we'll get to this other story sixty ... so it took a debt and then the pop back up\nOne eight six nine that was a fun trade this morning watching that and the I'm not going to tell you who was it was but uh you know it's so fun to be a part of it six hundred thousand dollars\nIs was the the value of that little a fund\nSo to speak with that they went out and buy is not really a fun so it's like a buying account so they went out in the buying account six hundred thousand they bought Ninety thousand dollars worth of the coin eighty four coins per was eighty four coins watched it go up a couple of hundred dollars in Beckham oh wow it was that fast\nWent up bam\nThere back as again what are we looking at right now and then we'll get to this other story sixty ... so it took a debt\nAnd then the pop back up\nYou had to be poised when this happens you have to be poised because in the last twenty four hours it's really only moved about thirty three dollars\nThat's why you got to be paying attention you've got to be ready but when you're doing this and mass quantity it's not that hard okay a lot of fun to do anyway let's get back to some of these stories is real good stories going out today\nWhat are we looking at here business schools um by the way uh\nI have some really good citizen journalists that are out doing some investigating reports right now\nAnd there's a lot of good stories that are coming out in ... in ... hopefully we're going to break a few of them but uh there's some really good stories I hate to jumped the gun on them but especially on bitcoins birthday business schools are adding block pain courses to their curriculum now the number of block chain related jobs has increased by nearly\nThree hundred percent\nYear over year source a glass door that's the source on that called ... tech in the crypto community the finance industry itself is beginning to migrate into using blocked chain\nAnd the nature of the jobs are changing precisely because of this new technology is going to create millions and millions and millions of jobs millions millions\nNYU though there are do do over college university there is liberal is the day is long I Can't believe anybody could learn anything out of NYU for example is offering graduate level course\nWork on digital currency bloc chains in the future of financial services while they're getting one thing straight over there that the university right there it's number one and it's expensive to go there\nAnd number two they get a lot of federal funding and number three they're idiots sorry NYU\nThat's my take on new according to [laughter] according to a study done by coin base forty two percent of the world's top universities are now offering at least one course on either cryptic currencies get this\nAre you listening they're not completely stupid [laughter]\nForty two

trusted name in professional trainer education while we just got back from our annual conference there are\nLiterally hundreds and hundreds of people that work with online training academy all over the world and it's always great to kind of once a year everybody gets together and\nYou see a lot of old friends meet some new ones that whole thing but\nThat is not why you tuned into the show\nBut it it's actually it's a very exciting time for us and and in Phoenix particularly we're excited about a number of things\nA number of our staff WON Awards as being best in the world are operations manager Mary green one as the best operations manager in the world\nThose of you who are students I Know a will certainly respect that Mary finally got that at well ward and got her do as someone who is just done a great job with helping with students and making sure that we always have a very smoothly running operation\nBut also as a center once again we want what's called the brand champion award and there's a word has only been given three times and we have one at all three times\nAnd and then to me it's the most important in the words that are given out because of what it's about is we're the people that do the best job of representing the ideals of the company and the ideals of the company are all about students' success\nAnd we really do it online trading economy Phoenix try to focus on the students' first\nAnd and the philosophy I've always tried to impart to people it's students center itself and the first thing that we have to do is focus on doing the right thing for the student then it's kind of we got to keep the lights on what do we do for the center and only at the end we really worry about kind of the individual achievements and accolades\nAnd that is served as very well actually this week will be the the eighth year that I have owned the center there\nAnd uh we've come a long way and it's it's due to you guys with students listeners and all the eldest after just work so hard and so again I just wanted to kind of a shout out to everybody on the staffer for just all their hard work but also\nIt made me think about what is it that we do I think maybe differently than anybody else out there in the industry that makes it so successful and I will tell you if you look at overall reviews for online trading academy\nWhen students do their surveys after their their you know enroll in classes and whatnot which you find out that for all\nOnline trading academies worldwide of five stars seven Ninety seven point one percent of them give either four or five stars now of course in Phoenix it's Ninety seven point seven to but who is it [laughter] but\nYou know enroll in classes and what not what you find out that for all the online trading academies worldwide of five stars seven Ninety seven point one percent of them give either four or five stars now of course in Phoenix it's Ninety seven point seven to but who is it [laughter] but\nBut it's essentially because they the people who win this or the people who do the best job of representing the values of the company and the values of the company are all about focusing on students' success and we were really really hard at it and it made me think about\nWhat is it that kind of we do I think well being supporting our students which took me to an even bigger question which was what is it really take to be successful in the market and talked about in the first segment the first thing you have to understand is what the markets really are which is totally different than what has been sold to us\nThey're not discounting mechanisms of future cash flow you cannot study a company's conference calls and know which companies are going to win and lose because first of all you're never going to know more than Goldman Sachs and city group and the people that run the companies\nThere's always going to be able to have an informational advantage so why should we try to compete where we have a weakness\nThe second part of it is is that the things that make a company successful change over time it's not just about the technology is devoted to raise money the ability to market the ability to sell its about out about sourcing and logistics it's about corporate culture it's about leadership it's\nAbout competitive response all things that change over time now one of the difficulties is that the market's done nothing but go up essentially for nine years although maybe seen some change in that right now but when\nThe market's going up every strategy works you know back in the nineties used to always talk about never confused genius with a bull market and I think there's a lot of risk and that today is well everybody that's been buying stocks and you know most people aren't doing great but they're doing kind of okay\nNow they have no real plan for what to do when the market goes down and that's like one of the really key pieces of information how do you not just survive when the market goes down but how do you thrive how do you develop a mindset to where you look forward to the opportunity of the market going down\nA conference one of the people I was talking to Jon o'donald one of the founders of online trading academies are chief knowledge officer and I said so how do you do and he said just waiting for the crash so I can be short [laughter] okay [laughter] and that's how we view this and it's not that\nWe do we ... we wish harm to other people in the market to go down but we know the market's going to go down at some point and again you're starting to see some real weakness in rock in it and\nMaybe this continues and maybe it's a reflection of interest rates and maybe as people worried about what happens after the election or any of thirty other things we've talked about on the show over the years\nKind of okay now they have no real plan for what to do when the market goes down and that's like one of the really key pieces of information how do you not just survive when the market goes down but how do your thrive how do you develop a mindset to where you look forward to the opportunity of the market going down\nA conference one of the people I was talking to Jon o'donald one of the founders of online trading academies are chief knowledge officer and I said so how you do and he said just waiting for the crash so I can be short [laughter] okay and that's how we view this and it's not that\nWe do we ... we wish harm to other people in the market to go down but we know the market's going to go down at some point and again you're starting to see some real weakness in rocky and his and\nMaybe this continues and maybe it's a reflection of interest rate and maybe it's people worried about what happens after the election or any of thirty other things we've talked about on the show over the years but there's a lot of things out there that one day have to come home to roost what we want to do is not dread that but just realize it's a fact of life\nAnd we want to be able to be successful when that happens we don't want to hope that we you know we lose a bunch of money and then somehow over time we get it to come back\nThis the individual stocks almost never come back\nIndexes come back because they're not that same stock and this is something else that most people don't really understand about the market they look at you know the Dow Jones industrial average in first they don't generally understand it's only thirty stocks and it's not really representative of of the market but okay fine\nBut then they think that it's kind of always the same stocks but it's not the stocks in the index is get changed out regularly which means that companies that go bankrupt to perform poorly\nThey go away and new stocks come in so it's a marketing tool and it gets back to the market is marketing it's people trying to convince you that this stock will get your clothes wider than white that this stock will make you more appealing to the opposite sex or whatever it may be and and I'm Serious that's what this is\nWhat happens is institutions buying stocks at low prices and this happens on an intra day basis and it happens on a very long term basis but they buy the stocks when they're cheap\nThey didn't tell you how wonderful they are they do other things as well to drive the price of the stocks up and then they sell them to you would have high price and lo and behold like any retail industry they make money because what they're doing is buying something and selling it for more\nThe retail trade or loses because they buy too late in the cycle and they don't know how to make money when it goes down and they don't how to know how to recognize the signs\nThat the market is changing direction and again we're seeing some signs right now that we may be starting that process\nIf you look at what's happening in Asia stocks are getting whack pretty hard most of the Asian indexes are down at least ten percent so far this month some of them are down to China's down about thirty percent this year okay and this is the other thing we've got that people don't fully grasp is\nThe market moves very very quickly to the down side and I'm explain why this is in class and why it's faster the downside than the upside but\nWhen the market's moving to the downside people don't have time to react as we've talked about on the show here before when the market plunged in two thousand and eight\nPrices for the S. and P. five hundred went back to Nineteen Ninety six levels the market literally gave back Thirteen Years of profits in a year and a half and people were totally blindsided\nBy but that money didn't disappear someone made that money somebody's sold before it went down some people did what's called go short which allows them to make money on those falls so this idea that the market crates and destroys wealth is wrong\nThere is an illusion of wealth creation there's an illusion of wealth destruction and\nExplain to you how you see past that\nIt was very very quickly to the down side and I'm explain why this is in class and why it's faster downside than the upside

they have your lunch\nAnd chaos ensues and we would like to get whatever Roswell so coming back to that\nThe the three main ... pillars of understanding how to make money in this market is understand that this is a game of probability is never a game of certainty\nBut we can get the highest possible probability if we know what to look for secondly the times that we're wrong we're going to randomly be wrong if we knew we were going to be wrong we wouldn't get into the trade so how do we minimize our losses those times were wrong then\nHow do we make our money work as hard for us as possible when you buy stock you generally have to put up at least half the money so if you buy a hundred dollar stock you have to put up you know fifty bucks in some cases you may only have to put up twenty five percent of the money but there are some rules to that\nIf you trade something white currencies you put up two percent of the money so have you on a straight a thousand dollars of a currency you'd literally put up twenty dollars and you can do trades where you literally put up twenty dollars\nAnd by the way when you trade something like currencies you're not dealing with things like stock throughout all time highs where it's very difficult to know you know what a way where where's the top in this market so so with currencies\nAre wanted these currencies are just kind of middle of the other pack right now and you can make money on these very quickly in both directions as well\nSo we want to understand what the right instrument is for us to be invested in trading in\nAnd understand again this probability risk manager and ... and using the leverage to make our money work for us again harder than we worked for it yet so again these are all the kinds of ideas that we teach in our classes it's what I'm going to do if you come out to the half day classes well\nNow the next set of skills that we really want to think about is\nPeople you know think about well you know this is so specialized I'm just going to let my adviser handled this with all due respect there's some people out there that advisors that are good people trying to do the right thing\nBut the reality is that the vast majority of them are simply commission sales people\nThey are drug reps masquerading as doctors they are selling you what will make them the most money not necessarily what is best for you the reason they sell you a new release is that is the highest commission product that's out there okay you're paying in many cases eight eight and a half percent\nMake our money worked for us again harder than we worked for it yet so again these are all the kinds of ideas that we teach in our classes it's what I'm going to do if you come out to the half day classes well now the next set of skills that we really want to think about is\nPeople you know think about well you know this is so specialized I'm just going to let my adviser handled this with all due respect there is some people out there that are advisors that are good people trying to do the right thing\nBut the reality is that the vast majority of them are simply commission sales people they are drug reps masquerading as doctors they are selling you what will make them the most money not necessarily what is best for you\nThe reason they sell you a new disease is that is the highest commission product that's out there okay you're paying in many cases eight eight and a half percent up front\nYou can't get your money out for years without a penalty you're giving up a huge percentage in some cases maybe over Ninety percent of the profits that are making on your money and you're taking the risk\nHow does that make any sense okay when they're selling you stocks are selling you I mean these big banks literally have meetings on Monday Mornings or every morning and they tell their people here's what we're going to sell today\nAnd how is it that that is in your best interests to have those people making decisions with your money and and one of the things I always try to get across to people would look\nEverybody's looking out for themselves okay you and your advisors aren't bad people but they've got to feed their kids to and so when it comes down to what's best for you and what's best for them part of what's best for them as what he is the most commission part of what's best for them is what can keep their boss off their back\nYou know and by the way you know when the market's going down and one of the reasons people take these big long to do their advisors always tell them hey you know don't sell now\nWhy did they tell you not to sell they tell you it's because the stocks always come back\nBut understand stock themselves don't generally come back with indexes comeback it can take Fifteen or Twenty years why would you give up half of your invest in life potential because most people thirty five or forty years give up half of it hoping to break even how is that is your best interest\nThe reason they tell you that you said as long as you own stocks you won't take your money out of the account and they can keep generating fees the minute you go to cash you might take your money out that's why they really tell you to do that but\nThe unfortunate reality is there's nothing in that decision process that comes down to hey well what's best for for Joe bag a donut through my client it's what's my boss smart way to sell or need me to sell what's paying the best bonus this month how do I get the highest commission and again it gets back to me to this to rational approaches to the market\nEither learn how to do this yourself and do it right or stay out there is no law that says you have to put your hard earned money at risk and the market but if you're going to do it do it as in foreign investor or a traitor and again one of the things that a lot of people have become students are at online training academy\nIt's just to even know the questions to ask so they don't feel so intimidated by the advisor so again if you want to understand how this stuff works and just to understand questions to ask her advisor\nBe one of the next dozen calls you can get to free tickets and a

psychologist now they say that it's because it's distracting\nThat people focus more on the ... music and everything else and that's what the psychologist Linda Blair I just want to say that it's very interesting that um Halloween I'm Talking about a psychologist named Linda Blair whose warning people about listening to Christmas music\nCritic who say\nThan to than [noise] but uh they say that there there was actually a study done that showed that stores that played slower Christmas music and also had quote unquote festive then\nGot people to stay in their stores longer but I Am ... psychologist named window blur warning people about listening to music celebrating Jesus and just saying\nRefugee they planned to carry out terror attacks that bomb the built in Vegas was caught and an elaborate FBI sting teaching agents to make ... skills he learned during the Gulf War report the daily mail\nWell look at this uh this individual Ahmed to hide Ahmed made two bombs in a condo in Vegas that we're going to be used in a terror attack in Mexico it was toward it because of the bureau set up this huge thing uh\nAnd uh now he is accused of teaching and making use of a weapon of mass

just over the week and it was had insurance I think we had it as actually like a quick five headlined and we\nUh yesterday was it was I'm pretty sure\nHe took to Twitter\nWas not pleased about it\nKind of West took to Twitter and this was after it was announced and I think everybody\nJust sort of thought that you know he knew of what was happening but he said I'm\nHe tweeted a\nI support or creating jobs\nAnd opportunities for people who need them to ... the most I support prison reform I support commonsense gun laws that will make our world safer\nI support those or risk their lives to serve and protect our support holding people misuse their power accountable I Believe in love and compassion for people seeking asylum and parents who friday protective shield them from the war\nAnd then he also said I introduce Canada's talking about oh and so the person and it just came to the person who made the logo and they didn't want their name on it so she used to mine I never wanted any association with blacks it\nI have nothing to do with it my eyes are now opened and my ... my eyes are now wide open and now realize I've been used to spread messages I don't believe in I Am just insane myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative three exclamation points\nCould be I I just I just don't think there's somebody that wasn't as hard as he did\nWhen he was meeting with the president and everything else I just I just don't see I don't think they'd get a change of heart I think that he actually politically he built I think you know I don't know I think he believes in some of the stuff\nI think he believes in certain things um I but I also think that he is not a conservative at all\nI think that there are just some things that there are some common ground you know like prison reform for instance there's some common ground\nI also think that he's under immense pressure from Hollywood there are people who are supposedly his friends attacking him because he was just speaking out differently about different political issues which I'm Sorry but if you treat me like that you ain't no friend of mine\nIt is amazing you'll find who your friends are once you start speaking about stuff you find who your friends are then you find who the ... the people who are just not but social climbers and they want the association you find the cleaners that Klinger honors the people who just want to hang out for the ride and they want you know they want some of the that that you find those people right quick\nThe week people fall you see\nI don't know maybe I Am speaking from people I Know\nYou find those people super fast\nAnd you also find the people that you know really appreciate you for being\nBecause typically voice you know an opinion about politics I I'm an ... Thomas Jefferson quote but I've never thought a difference in political beliefs would stand in the way of me being a friend with someone unless of course you're talking about completely disarming the and making the victim in which case step off um but\nI think you can find common ground with people yeah I ... it by finding common ground for those who have one brain cell up I don't mean that you compromise with you\nBut social climbers and they want the association you find the cleaners the cleaner honors the people who just want to hang out for the ride and they want you know they want some of the that that you find those people right quick\nThe week people fall you see\nI don't know maybe I'm speaking from people I Know\nYou find those people super fast\nAnd you also find the people that you know really appreciate you for being you\nBecause simply voice an opinion about politics I I'm an ... Thomas Jefferson quote but I've never thought a difference in political beliefs would stand in the way of me being a friend with someone unless of course you're talking about completely disarming the and making the victim in which case stuff off um but\nI think you can find common ground with people you know by by finding common ground for those who have one brain cell up I don't mean that you compromise what you believe in I'm just saying you find something that you do agree on was someone\nAnd maybe start some sort of amicable relationship there\nIt's not hard it's like people forgot how to get along\nBut I think he got so much pressure yeah people who claimed that they knew him people were friends with and people you know et cetera that were\nMainly to get their name and the press more than anything else\nThere was a huge amount of pressure\nBecause I think people realize if you even have one person who is prevalent in pop culture that decides to speak out on these issues then that\nCould create a that that creates a of\nAn effect people start\nOther people will start believing this they'll start going all those start thinking the same thing or those start asking questions being the underdog has always been trendy\nThe biggest why right now that's being perpetuated is that the mainstream demand the status quo\nThose people are trying to convince you that they're the underdog they're not they've mainstream everything hippies or mainstream ... they're not counter culture they are the culture it's counter culture\nTo want limited government it's counter culture to believe that you are empowered enough to take care of your own crap right that's what counterculture counterculture to believe that you don't have to sit here and go tug on the paint like an Uncle Sam every single day in time you got a problem that you need salt that it's counter culture\nAnd so they really want to keep that appearance because that's so people like bucking the system there's just something attractive about it\nThere's something attractive about going there is something taboo and taboo also psychological I mean it's its own branding\nBut he's got so much pressure so now\nHe's stepping back I also think\nHe's seven back for a couple of other\nSo he's got some new sneakers coming up through to eat is\nThe easy that he has that right now they're not moving product\nSo we're coming up on what season\nFollow la la la man\nI almost said Yoho but that was the pirates are being you get what I'm saying right\nSo you got to follow the money\nHe's got some sneakers coming up thirty to see what's supposed to have an album\nAh that if it was it was postponed a ...\nThat was supposed to come out his album that he came up before that didn't move as many copies as the previous album\nNow I'm\n...

taken under so quick by Sally\nLover did as quick five [noise] All right so let's see here [noise]\nUm or want to go around when I go oh this is where this is terrifying so daily mail has this report about the CDC where there are all of this polio cases springing up everywhere there's actually a bunch in North Texas [noise]\nAnd another ten cases of this polio like disease confirmed the CDC director says the mystery illnesses striking ... us as their top priority although they're getting a lot of criticism from sort of being behind the ball on that are being a\nBehind on this um but it's that they can't figure out exactly what's going on but they say it's their top priority but it starts um they've called a at them and it is it the viral infection specifically attack the final two they are at a spinal cord ... called the gray matter and that's what\nAnd it just continues from their uh but oh my goodness that's kind of terrifying to think about that are still investigating as to how it is spreading to put them why so many kids are getting it cetera good night\nAnd uh in case you missed it I think I think today's let's say you can get that Starbucks which is for the thing that's made with she at the bat war if that's what they called that worked at basically eleventh two thousand calories and it looks ... within a purple and green and it's available at\nA Starbucks or just\nOr have a lot more coming up\nA lot more coming up\nI'm not being naive I don't think that he's just I think he believes\nHe's on doing something that was done with executive orders what I think honestly um but\nI don't think that he's doing it to be like a tyrant I think that he didn't he believes that he's doing something that was done unconstitutionally with an executive order or just based on the the how we address it and some of the statements that he is dead and things that he has discussed previously on it\nBut when it concerns doing anything we're amending anything with the constitution I get very nervous when I anytime I hear anybody any party\nTalking of the executive branch of doing it with an e oh because\nI don't ever want it to become so common place at an executive order modify something in the constitution that something can be done regarding the second amendment over it\nOr even the first amendment\nOr any or the fourth or any of them\nParticularly your natural right so that's where I get really really nervous and it's not supposed to be easy to amend the constitution it that is not a bug of the system it is a feature of the system is supposed to be incredibly difficult\nIt was it was there are all of these safeguards put in place that basically they are you sure you want to do this\nYou really like for real about doing this right now\nReally really it's like when you\nHit something to close the window you really wanna causes when did you want to leave the session but imagine sort of like one or two when does the ... of them pop up that kind of feature of the way our system works\nAs it concerns\nI I mean I don't think that there is an allowance when when they I think that the the fight comes if\nI just I mean I just don't think that there is an allowance there but I'm I'm concerned again about executive orders I Want to see some sort of judicial reveal\nWhere when they just got specifically the\nJurisdiction clause\nBecause people who are not citizens they're not afforded the rights of the country what they are not citizens\nI Know that there's so many different discussions as to what it means and what it doesn't mean and and and I see a lot of individuals who say well this is what so and so they said that they wrote this and this was the intent behind it\nAnd I think that's where you get into the you know esoteric conversation versus the the strict ... conversation that's happening here\nBecause and bear with me\nThis is ... and maybe and maybe the justices you know the justices have to rely on case law\nWhere when they just got specifically the\nJurisdiction clause\nBecause people who are not citizens they're not afforded the rights of the country what they are not citizens\nAnd I know that there's so many different discussions as to what it means and what it doesn't mean and and and I see a lot of individual who say well this is what so and so they said that they wrote this and this was the intent behind it\nAnd I think that's where you get into the you know esoteric conversation versus the the strict textural is conversation that's happening here\nBecause and bear with me\nThis is ... and maybe and maybe the justices you know the justices have to rely on ...\nThis is where you get into that there's there's two different conversations that are happening in the chair conversation that this was the intent and then you have the texture of conversation that this is what they meant and so that is where\nThat's where the conversation is about that particular clause at this point\nAnd I\n... every every lawyer here's one thing that all the lawyers could remember how I was telling you how\nThe lawyers are fighting with each other as to whether or not an executive order could be used one thing that they all agreed on is that\nAnd we were talking to our friend Jake Christian Adams yesterday\nOne of the things that that they all did agree on is that it isn't it has not been clarified that particular clause as it concerns jurisdiction when you're talking about naturalized citizens and citizenship et cetera et cetera and\nThat a rational actual constitutional based review of it\nWould go in favor [noise] like of or at least in favor of what Republicans see when they look at or conservative see when they look at naturalization and citizenship and you know what jurisdiction means et cetera\nBut we just got to be really [noise] I get sweaty hand nervous when people start talking about that stuff\nBecause I\nI feel like a lot of conservatives are not a lot but I Do definitely feel that some\nAre starting to make the um\n... they're starting to make the mistake that a lot of progress is made previously in that they think that we we have we have power at this particular moment so we can do this because you know it's been done before but we're going to do it right\nNo you can't do that\nThere are limitations\nThere are limitations\nSo we'll see but I just it's weird to me going back to the tweet I just don't I mean this dude getting totally dragged for it and it's like he has to say something super crazy\nJust to make up for the fact that he said one thing that that really isn't any different from what Democrats have died for decades\nWe uh pull up my my thing here\nThey were are we at I like totally run off my she I'm Sorry oh my gosh I'm going

miles\nBy former President Obama in exchange\nTo get bow Bergdahl back\nWell those five members of the Taliban\nThey joined the Taliban again\n... finance\nThe and they are now\nWhile they rejoined the Taliban\nAnd in fact one of the political analyst a heroin mere because one of the defenses that I see being sung by some of the left is is that do they just joined the Taliban to negotiate for peace and\nBe peace representatives and these are white people here in the United states that have never left the United states that are saying is meanwhile her room here who is a political analyst analysts any Afghan capital that quote the Taliban are bringing back or a whole generation which means the Taliban have not changed their thinking or their leadership\nThere you go support in to those

income coming in could that be increased money going out can decrease the expenses that are in my life that are wasteful expenses\nThen I'm going to look at when I get on the income side you know what is by net worth doing for me what is the money in my house already made which is nothing was before on cable you know have\nHurting me and it's paying me nothing for months my race paying me nothing for a month what do I have my savings account earning a quarter of a percent or half reset nowadays are up to one is my buddy Dewey for me in the answer is it's doing absolutely nothing for you so what is\nThe worst and most challenging are most important thing to do and that is don't lose money roared dealt with money and if you're losing it if it's going out the door past\nWhat's wrong and you've got to analyze it so as I Would analyze my personal financial situation I Would look for income come and get can that be increased money going out can decrease the expenses that are in my life that are wasteful expenses\nThen I'm going to look at when I get on the income side you know what his by net worth doing for me what is the money in my house already made which is nothing what does the four one K. money I have\nBurning me and it's paying me nothing for months biracial paying me nothing per month what do I have my savings account earning a quarter of a percent or half percent now days or two one is my money doing for me and the answer is it's doing absolutely nothing for you so what is\nThe worst and most challenging are most important thing to do and that is don't lose money rule was dealt with money and if you're losing it if it's going out the door past and you can bring it in\nYour not going to save it so and I looked at my landscape situation [noise]\nMy first priority was okay what am I losing\nWhat do I need I Need to stop the bleeding what is the most important thing to fix first as I looked at my landscaping I realized that I was losing plants which is expensive to do in grass also\nBecause I wasn't getting enough water so I went around person here does I pick the area of my life that I wanted to work on which was my front yard a actually a quarter tip of my arts and very small portion of my job yard and I took that is that I got to master this corner right here\nAnd so I looked at the sprinkler systems I saw there was to sprinkle heads were broken so I took them out and put a new ones and solve that problem\nThat also had an area that was flooded and so I turned the area that was flooded off completely\nAnd I put in low flow water heads and said okay now when I turned his back on the area that's dry I'm input on higher for water heads so it gets more water in those areas 'cause obviously those areas needed in over here where it's a very tight area and there's too many heads I'm going to put down low flow heads of slowed down\nA thinking ahead it all solved right then\nI picked up the next thing you do if you're out there looking at your finances you've got to say OK I'm working on this one what do I do to fix that when it used to sing what YouTube has out there for you it's amazing what lifestyles has over here for you the information in life to become successful in whatever endeavor you're out to attack is out there somewhere\nGet your hands on so I'm Googling the stuffing spending hours sitting up at night watching these videos and stuff of what's going wrong and what are they just made it very obvious that\nI have not been feeding my grass in years past I fertilized my grass on a regular basis now because I broke my foot that it broke my ankle\nA tuition might need ... broke my elbow tore my price up off the last six months I haven't been able to exercise at all which means there's no way I could get out there putting fertilizer and you can push the stupid cart and so\nI just got their start fertilizing this thing up I started fertilizer up put a little ... little we'd kill and all of a sudden things started getting a little green but in the areas where it had not crowded out\nIt was becoming beautiful thick while winning over here in these areas it's it's not getting me there yet and then I took it written articles guy said you need to fertilize more often and I'm thinking you can't ... and he does something it's going to kill the grass he talked about how to fertilize did not kill the grass in the heat of summer\nAnd talked about how to turn this thing around so I started fertilize it\nEvery week or just a little bit so that as fertilizer got watered in and try to take effect I could put a little new fresh fertilizer on their little new weed killer on there to kill some do each and slowly but surely over the next two weeks you start to see a dramatic change in this part of the yard but I still had the flooded out area I'd fix\nUp for the little ... little we'd kill and all of a sudden the things started getting a little green but in the healthy areas where it had not crowded out\nIt was becoming beautiful thick go wow winning over here in these areas it's it's not kidding me there yet and then I took her to read an article the guy said you need to fertilize more often and I'm thinking you can't ... and he does something it's going to kill the grass he talked about how to fertilize it not kill the grass in the heat of summer\nAnd talked about how to turn this thing around so I started fertilize it\nEvery week or just a little bit so that as that fertilizer got water did and\nTry to take effect that could put a little new fresh fertilizer on their little new weed killer on there to kill some do each and slowly but surely over the next two weeks you start to see a dramatic change in this part of the yard\nBut I still had the flooded out area I fix theories that were due dry never worked starting to come back but the flooded out or a didn't I couldn't seem to fix even though I put a low flow heads it was still getting too much water so I analyze the situation when I realized was there was actually a golly now there is\nA\nRegular storm golly that goes along the front of my yard and sides my Yard's goes to a creek you know runs out its natural but even within that goalie there was a low area so low that the water will just sit there couldn't get out of that area to go and follow the natural training trout and\nI thought about it you don't wanna like instead of worrying about how to dig deeper I was going to dig deeper ditches and with the deeper ditches that maybe I could change the flow water and get it away from that area but uh you know it'd be easier than that why not just the whole thing\nAnd so that's the next to them and tries to go ahead and solve the problem like throwing the whole it and the point I'm making is as you start to look at your situations financially and we sit down with you working with you on these things sometimes we're going to dig a little sometimes you're going to fill\nSometimes we have to fix things with a twist to the right sometimes with the suicide to laugh but we're taking just one part so for looking at your four one K. and we're saying what can we do to make a four one K. more profitable for you we have a lot of things to work on there and we'll have a lot of possibilities we can do with that money both inside the foreign care outside the four one K. they'll make a major difference\nBut we've got to take that four one K. apart mentally\nTo get to the point where it's actually going to make a difference and if we don't do that then we're not going to be able to solve the problem because the problem is going to be solved\nSimply by\nDoing more of what does it work the other words contributing more isn't going to make it happen that we're feeding the four one K.\nYou can actually overfeed something a lot of people putting money into the four oh one K. makes no sense at all because they're putting in more than what the matches\nDoesn't make any sense to do that because for all case a retarded investment to start with yes I said it retarded it's ridiculously stupid thing to do but if you're gonna do it doing more of it is worse than doing less of it\nSo as we go to these battles each in everything would tear your four one K. situation of part would tear your personal residents\nSituation part will tear your earned income situation of art will look at you and not exist as passive income situation see where we can build some passive income et cetera et cetera will look at your expense is your home expenses where are you wasting money you could say to start saving money so you can invest more\nWe're doing more of it is worse than doing less of it\nSo as we go through these battles each and every day we tear your four one K. situation apart would tear your personal residents\nSituation but we'll terrier earned income situation apart look at you not exist in the past few income situation see where we could build some ... et cetera et cetera will look at your expense is your home expenses where are you wasting money you could say start saving money so you can invest more\nBut you can't leave it there you got to crank it back down again because once you've got it growing and saturated now you're going to get it are you going to turn its keep assumed whether you're going to get mould and so on and so forth so it's a it's a balancing act guys you got to stay on top of but we are talking about this just one zone in my house so I now\nI'm working my way out of that so right so you're working your way out of okay what are we gonna do with this extra cars that extra car payment we don't need what are we gonna do with the you know we've got four hundred stations a cable we only watch the same ten stations every single time [noise] uh you know do we really need all that are just\nAll this stuff in your life you're wasting money it's just a waste that you don't really need to do [noise] um\nAre you going out to eat too often and now it's not a little bit too much like Dave Ramsey but the bottom line is there is an expense sides of the equation now when I got back in my yard here after I had stabilize\nThis front area I had to let it sit for a couple of days a week or two and see what it would turn into I had to let the fertilizer take effect\nI had to let the change of lawn chair companies take effect I had to let the change of a rotator heads on the sprinkler systems take effect [noise]\nUm so I sat that went off the side as sort of why should I made it a point every day to go out and watch it look what's happening see what's going on and then it went on to my next zone\nAnd the next so it was truly a watering problem the heads a sprinkler has one of them was buried underneath the plant there's growing like a hundred times the size of originally planted it so the sprinkler once I was on the edge of the bed or now it's you know ...\nSix foot under a plan so I had to trim the plant away so to speak with you get to the area\nOr that was dead I had another area that was dead because the sprinkler head\nOr was not adjustable heads it wasn't hitting the area effectively a bit the head couldn't be adjusted so that has to be replaced or your two or three of those out there with their heads and thirdly it was a gigantic area with three hundred sixty degree rotary heads and they take a long time to get all the way around so you either got to\nLeave the water running for a long time\nI'm fortunate for rotary three sixty road we had to get everything or you've got\nIts own and the next so it was truly a watering problem that the heads sprinkler has one of them was buried underneath the plant there's growing like a hundred times the size of originally planted it so the sprinkler once I was on the edge of the bed or now it's you know ...\nSix feet under a plan so I had to trim the plant away so the struggling to get to the area\nA that was dead and another area that was dead because the sprinkler head\nOr was not adjustable heads it wasn't hitting the area effectively a butthead couldn't be adjusted so that has to be replacing it two or three of those out there with their heads and thirdly it was a gigantic area with three hundred sixty degree rotary heads and they take a long time to get all the way around so you either got to\nLeave the water running for a long time\nI'm fortunate for rotary three sixty road we had to get everything or you've got to increase the flow water out of the rotary it well I Can't leave it running longer because they're in that same set up zone there are a bunch of heads it only go a hundred and eighty degrees\nAnd so if you set it to quit your lawn sauce is a hundred and eighty degrees and knocked over water the hundred and eighty degree once you end up under watering the three sixties\nSo now I have to go back out take the three sixty heads off and put more water and that so I can cut the whole thing backed out so I don't have the swamp in one area and a drier and these are things that\nCould not have been known were in the program the process from originally designed or maybe they could have been but there were just you know they took the short cut just did it the easy way but at the bottom line is here I Am Seventy years later not never took the time to figure this out because it wasn't until I lost control of my yard stop fertilize mayor\nThat I got to the point where I could actually see how wrong in these situations worsening my point you is\nHow far does your finances have to go wrong before you wake up and say I need a new plan this one isn't working it's just not working\nHow long before you realize you have no positivity in your life\nWe want to do next you know we went to the backyard\nWhere we planted took out all the tropical supplanted all these hedge has to get this what we call English garden effect\nBoxes everywhere and we'd feel some of those zones with roses and they drift roses which a short little rose and look beautiful we and others owns we put in an uh angels and and when we put the angels and they were beautiful but come back around this year again\nAnd all those angels are dead\nNow we've gone through this three years but now I don't have a landscaping company so for two months that sit there and there's nothing in Tibet so finally we sat ready to go put some stuff in the ... right [noise]\nAnd what we found out was one of the heat of the summer\nAnything you plant now will die by September all new plants that will survive the winter come in September and our plan in September and October so\nWe had to realize there is a timing to fixing certain things in your life there is a timing in your life when you can get your money out of your four one K. effectively or more effectively or less effectively there's a timing when you can retire there's a timing issue with when you and how you pay your bills\nAnd so on and so forth and so we had to get involved with the timing issue the other thing we had to do was stop the bleeding\nSo we took a very large portions of these bettered areas and just put in Rose's again beautiful small short trip roses to fill them just makes it look beautiful\nBut you don't have to do anything with them their their summer and winter\nYou're done so I started putting plants in solve the problem I'm done with those areas other than reading in fertilizing and that's something you gotta keep in mind the expense of owning things never goes away\nThere was a timing in your life when you can get your money out of your four one K. effectively or more effectively or less effectively there's a timing when you can retire there's timing issue with when you and how you pay your bills and so on and so forth\nAnd so we had to get

areas other than reading it fertilized and that's something you gotta keep in mind the expense of owning things never goes away there's always going to be with union fertilizing so\nWe get back to the pools we're filling in these beds and now we're investing it's up to now we're buying that red house by buying these plants are putting these plants and that will die that will stay there you have to Europe year I'm investing\nI'm getting the return from those players the beauty\nWithout the annual cost and maintenance management to the to putting the new budget every single year I'm solving my long term problems by investing in something that will pay dividends for years that's what you need to do with a red house or department will take a short break be right back and so I was

our broadcast on any of the other stations am an F and that you're currently are listening to you will still get it none of that though one of the broadcasters been diminished\nSo cake AMC in the south bay area of California up in Chico kick a execs and cake Avi in Las Vegas\nUh our our\nMP three blast emails that we send out the program each week to people who cannot hear it in any one of these other radio stations we will continue to do that but this gets even better for a couple of reasons number one\nOf the dark sky radio as a uh is Donnelly a secular radio cite\nHowever for the first time really we tried it a little a little while before it didn't really work with me because when it comes to I may be a nerd but I'm not a nerd in the ... area of how to do this stuff and God brought me the person to begin to do podcasts\nFor red sky radio those pod cast are going to be accessible\nUnder dark sky radio dot com under the tab podcast and you'll see red sky radio there where you'll be able to pick up and download\nA programs and so forth take them on whatever device you listen to a whole bunch of stuff I really have no idea what I'm Talking about 'cause I don't know how to do it but but guys brought me the person to do it\nThe next really fabulous thing about this collaboration with dark sky radio which is a house out of the Arizona\nIs that the is that red sky radio is now going to be available throughout the entire world I Am really so excited about this you see the spiritual battles we fight\nWe fight him here but they're ultimately no different than the battles that people fight anywhere and everywhere that they're a that on earth\nThe problems on earth are the same all over\nYou have the enemy of our souls\nThe enemy of the the devil who fights everything we do we have the authority to to deal him blows through the word of God which we do\nBut the battles are the same whether it's promiscuity whether it's drug abuse whether it's it's a atheism that's taught in the schools although most atheism taught in the schools these days happens to be in the United states\nBut this station fifty percent of the listeners of this station come from foreign companies ... companies countries which the dominant stations if I if I understood this correctly are India Dubai and Russia\nSo the thought of this program being on in those countries frankly is humbling exciting\nBut humbling and I am looking forward to entering and through the door that God has opened up and made financially possible by some generous by all donors threads sky radio I Want\nBut the battles are the same whether it's promiscuity whether it's drug abuse whether it's it's a atheism that's taught in the schools although most atheism taught in the schools these days happens to be in the United states\nBut this station fifty percent of the listeners of this station come from foreign companies ... companies countries which the dominant stations if I if I understood this correctly are India Dubai and Russia\nSo the thought of this program being on in those countries frankly is humbling exciting\nBut humbling and I am looking forward to entering and through the door that God has opened up and made financially possible by some generous by all donors threads sky radio I Want to thank all donors we have some that are are so regular some that are very generous\nAnd uh no it doesn't quite meet all the needs but but man comes close\nAnd um and of course I throw some of my own skin into it but that's fine I'm this is this is part of what I Do this what God's called me to do I contribute to my own ministry if you will but I think the donors and contributors to the station that have helped to make this expansion\nPossible and I just have to believe God is going to reward this if I Am faithful to his word now\nBefore I get on to some specific election things\nWith respect to Oregon I recommend that we had been encouraging people to vote for these individuals in Nevada and Arizona the two states where red sky radio has its biggest impact um although there's a lot of impact in California I just don't have good choices for people who have been\nI'm Sorry folks I'm not trying to beat up California but it's just one dark place\nAnd there are no flashlights over there that are brightening up much much of any room in any district has seems to be just a few little matches trying to go on\nThe Republicans have all been thrown in their towel they're ready to lose Orange County and parts of San Diego county which had been traditionally a conservative and Republican there's questions about losing that that's how far over the precipice California has gone so our time is going to be spent frankly where can make a greater difference\nAnd uh you know what I'm so far into this let me just finish this because I'll just finished a recommendation I'll finish up with a good news after this so you need to make sure\nThat Nevada which is a purple state leaning towards blue because of the invasion if you will of Californians who are who are fleeing the very thing that they've created the mess that they've created the mess they voted for now they're fleeing and\nThey don't think that they've had anything to contribute to the mess they've created now to go over and make a mess in Nevada and not connect their presence and their voting patterns where the pile that they left in\nUh in California they don't make that connection and that's what turned Nevada blue here recently\nBut you need to be out there in voting and need to vote for the right just write down these three names you'll see him on your ballot Tarkanian Heller and lack sold Tarkanian Heller and lack salt you just go to your sample ballot you'll find the offices in\nArizona ... my goodness the Arizona Republic first time in forty years endorsed the Democrat and she is from the pit of hell are Christians cinema is awful emphasis on cinema is on sin\nShe's a she's a ... a jaundiced viewed burnt fried um X. Mormon who apparently\nHates the church hates her ex husband hates everything\nNot connect their presidents and their voting patterns where the pile that they left in ... in California and they don't make that connection\nAnd that's what turned to Nevada blue here recently\nBut you need to be out there and voting and need to vote for the right just write down these three names you'll see 'em on your ballot Tarkanian\nHeller and lack salt Tarkanian Heller and lack sold you just go to your sample ballot you'll find the officers in Arizona\n... my goodness the Arizona Republic first time in forty years endorsed the Democrat and she is from the pit of hell are Christians cinema is awful emphasis on cinema is on sin\nShe's a she's a ... a jaundiced viewed burnt fried I'm\nEx Mormon who apparently hates the church hates her ex husband hates everything a masculine my gosh this woman has awful she is absolutely from the pit of hell Christian cinema do not vote for her Martha ... you've got to pull up pull the lever for her you got to try to hang onto a\nThey just said look we have been bought in the past we have been controlled but this is why and I'm quoting a this young gal again she said but this is why we love Donald Trump\nOr that we love Donald Trump and she said we love you Mr President because you have not been bought you're not a politician you haven't been controlled\nHow could you not like this this is a person standing up to speak on behalf of somebody she's probably taken a hit from some of her friends like Kanye West appears to have and we'll get to that in a minute what should we love you Mr bread and then went on to say something I got to have everybody\nHere whatever you're doing and you can just stop and listen to this one next statement she said Mr President you are the best president we have ever had\nWe know are the best president we have ever had not actually do you think this would make CNN do you think this would make and MSNBC NBC but nothing but Clinton a channel the ABC all all all Brock channel\nNo CBS the crummy broadcasting system\nCouldn't go right on down the line see an end the communist news network Clinton news network crummy news network crappy news network you can even know they're not going to do that they're not going to give people truth\nAnd show people what's really happening when it serves their political devices and gold from the pit of hell to keep people in the dark they're not about light they've never been about news they've only ever been about propaganda\n\nWe know are the best president we have ever had not actually do you think this would make CNN do you think this would make and MSNBC NBC but nothing but Clinton a channel the ACC all all all Brock channel\nNo CBS the crummy broadcasting system\nYou couldn't go right on down the line CNN the communist news network Clinton news network crummy news network crappy news network you can even know they're not going to do

light they've never been about news they've only ever been about propaganda\nThey've only they don't reflect the news they create news and they don't really even create news they may create stories propaganda is not news and to the extent that they hide it can seal it distorted ignore it\nThere's no news service done that's why I'm Glad really for the Internet expansion because it's given us an opportunity to go and get our news from other sources and we ... we don't have to rely on some rag like the New York times or now more recently the Arizona Republic\nSo this this um business folks\nJust can't tell you how excited because this is what I prayed for\nThis new civil rights movement the no more demon crap plantation this is a kind of revival this country needs as I said I don't see this great real awakening\nAmong uh uh among whites by and large there is a significant number of a white Christians\nBut I got to tell you you ... you take me a white heterosexual mail probably full of toxic masculinity\nYeah probably so maybe maybe I should say that with pride\nAnd we don't get the microphone I got to pay for the microphone with your gracious help I get a microphone\nBut we don't get access to places I'm not a that maybe we used to and you might say well you didn't deserve to have access to before whatever it is we sort of our disqualified I got an hour after my name which stands for reject\nAnd we are ones who are not even apparently qualified to speak because we've been the recipients of white privilege well\nTo whatever extent that that's true it doesn't matter as it relates to my bottom line advice here\nIn Arizona is going to stay conservative as Nevada is going to teeter but swing back to the right and save itself from the press precipice is going to be because some of the lazier people I don't say lazy or just ones with the ... elections don't matter get out and finally\nA finally do vote but it's going to ultimately\nAnd and some today more so in the future going to be dependent upon what the black and Hispanic communities do and one of the things that I saw that it was just it was encouraging and it was of no surprise was this sense the strength\nOf the gospel among these four hundred black Americans now not everybody who spoke gave ... got the glory but one guy who was the main organizer with America had on did you should we thank God for this moment we didn't God for opening our eyes\nYou see real unity exists when the people in the body of Christ come together forget the color smaller that doesn't matter we know that\nWe we all those are those people were real Christians no that is\nAnd you're just ones with the ... elections don't matter get out and finally a finally do vote but it's going to ultimately\nAnd and some today more so in the future going to be dependent upon what the black and Hispanic communities do and one of the things that I saw that it was just it was encouraging and it was of no surprise was this sense the strength of the gospel among these four\nHundred black Americans now not everybody who spoke gave ... God the glory but one guy who was the main organizer with America had on did you should we thank God for this moment we didn't God for opening our eyes you see real unity exist when the people in the body of Christ come together forget the color smaller that doesn't matter\nWe know that we we all\nThose are those people who are real Christians know that it is whether you are white and black churches predominantly black whether you're black in the church is predominately white or in your church is predominantly Hispanic it doesn't matter folks it feels wonderful\nTo be with a buddy of Christ that is where there's real unity and not to let anything from our past rise up an eclipse\nVoting how Jesus would vote what Jesus vote Jesus being Jewish I mean this is a great question I think just getting guy just gave it to me Jesus being Jewish\nAnd let's suppose there is any election in Jerusalem and there are two people to vote for one is Jewish and he just so happens to be a hypocritical\nScribe are fair a city and there's Asian tile\nWho got saved calling for a return to true worship where Jesus vote for the Jewish guy because he's Jewish\nBut that'd be racist blow of sort of it would be to start but moreover than that Jesus would vote the person who most closely come ports and sticks with a proclamation of his word Jesus can\nGo against his word otherwise you'd be a liar why would you support somebody who goes against and hates his word why would Jesus support somebody who is really a phobic somebody who is Christ a phobic somebody who's ally him a phobic somebody who's el shut die of phobic\nNo he wouldn't do that he wouldn't be voting somebody who's Jewish because they're Jewish\nAnymore than somebody who is white to be voting for somebody who is white because you're white or somebody who was black voting for somebody because they're black or half black or Hispanic voting because her last name as ... you know what a ... that's wrong\nAnd the only way\nThat you can eclipse the identity racially dividing demonic politics of the left\nIs to rise above it based on a higher platform any higher principle it's called the word of God do we vote in accordance was biblical principles understanding\nThat there is no perfect candidate out there and Jesus isn't running okay\nOnly perfect ... and he's not running and when he returns it won't be a democracy folks just a little surprise here when he comes back and we're all riding on these white horses and we just send and there was a major massacre was a word of God or the blood is up to the parietal although ... says the horses bridal\nThis isn't going to be the Jesus of tolerance and inclusive any at that time it's going to be the Jesus answering the prayers of all those who have been murdered for the gospel who says in revelation of asked them how long\nThe left is to rise above it based on a higher platform any higher principle it's called the word of God do we vote in accordance with biblical principles understanding\nThat there is no perfect candidate out there\nAnd Jesus isn't running okay\nThey usually only perfect ... and he's not running and when he returns it won't be a democracy folks just a little surprised here when he comes back and we're all riding on these white horses and we just send and there's a major massacre why the word of God or the blood is up to the parietal although horses oranges bridal\nThis isn't going to be the Jesus of tolerance and inclusive any at that time it's going to be the Jesus answering the prayers of all those who have been murdered for the gospel who says in revelation of asked them how long how long were you wait to avenge or blood\n[noise] and you know what it's not going to be anything oh this is a white supremacy because we happened to be on a white orders is not going to be well this is this that are that they're not going to be any of that divisive stuff look\nInterestingly Jesus was brown and maybe that's sort of a nice vet\nHe was a Jewish people had a very colored ... complex shit but maybe that sort of a blend of all the races I don't know but it really doesn't I don't really care if he was white or if he was black if he was actually Asian\nIf he's lord and savior he's lord and savior he's the one to whom I all my ... and allegiance and I am going to vote for someone whose values most closely line up with a word of God anything else is virtually blasphemous\nHow could you say that you are Christian and you're voting for those who support on biblical values and not only on biblical values anti biblical values there actually overtly against God outwardly hateful of the Bible and the word of God how could you support that\nWhile I Will tell you and if you don't vote you have you have actually voted for the enemy if you don't vote for who is good then you have actually contributed yes you have contributed to the campaign of the enemy\nWell\nAnyway the new civil rights movement I Love I Love that it is the new civil rights movement and that's our rights as Christians it's our right as children of God to rise up and just say this is the way it needs to be maybe it won't happen\nBut don't not stand up\nDon't be like some of our pastors are a whole bunch of them were like I said are just UNIX and clerical robes who don't have the guts don't have the spiritual go ... to speak to issues of huge relevance [noise]\nI got to tell you something I did not get it done before this program I wished I had gotten a done I didn't but even if I did I don't think I'd have time to fit it in I Am making a chronology it's going to be a mess and somewhere to some church who will invite me that will invite me\nEven if I did I don't think I'd have time to fit it in I Am making a

time the market and you think well I got time if I make a mistake I got time for the market in my money to recover but yeah basically if you're looking to start to take income five or ten years from now from your accounts or even next month\nOr next year you know you don't have that time\nYou also want to or\nWant to make sure as a goal that you'll be able to increase your income overtime to help maintain your purchasing power\nEven if inflation rate is not to I mean if it's one percent over ten year period that could cause issues the hiring one percent of could even cause more issues but it's not just the what the inflation rate is that what your cost of living in you know not the government's cost of living your costs a lot of it\nAnd we want to be able to make sure we can increase our income to keep up with a purchasing power\nHow about a look at it ideas to reduce risk maybe you know ... reduce spread that doesn't mean that in that in the market by being able to reduce your risk and you got three three major risk to really consider here as you approach retirement the one risk is picking a bad time to retire\nYou know picking a bad time to retire whatever your investments to before and then right after you retire\nAnd then the risk also being able to keep up with the cost of rising costs and then also the risk of making sure that your income last a lifetime or does not run out of money\nAnd other goal maybe we want to look at is preserving principle right you know we want to be able to\nI mean if you want to be able to make sure we can increase our income to keep up with a purchasing power\nHow about all looking at ideas to reduce risk maybe you know ... reduce spread that doesn't mean that in that in the market by being able to reduce your risk and you got three three major risk to really consider here yeah you approach retirement the one risk is picking a bad time to retire\nYou know picking a bad time to retire whatever your investments to before and then right after you retire\nAnd then the risk also being able to keep up with the cost of rising costs and then also the risk of making sure that your income last a lifetime or does not run out of money\nAnd other goal maybe we want to look at is preserving principle right you know we want to be able to have money set aside for emergencies other things that come up other needs being able to preserve what'd you saved and worked hard to say for\nAnd you know you still generate income but be able to preserve what you have\nAn impossibly we went to a look at a another goal is looking at to look at the best chance of increasing your returns over time\nYou know by maybe perhaps being able to keep money invested in the market you know historically you know study in his historical numbers show that stock market out performs the bond market which out performs\nYou know like uh the uh money markets et cetera over time you can't predict that's going to continue but historically had that has to be the best chance of being able to grow money keep up with inflation is by being able to have money invested\nIn the market and get that rate of return over time but we want to do it in a smart way in a goal is to still be able to be invested but be and that's the smart way\nSo perhaps looking at again looking at ways to reduce the impact of your emotions\nOn your retirement planning\nThe emotions of whatever's going on in the stock market what you're doing with your investments try to reduce that impact as much as possible look to increase your income over time maintain your purchasing power over time keep up with your cost of living that the government's cost of living\nAnd then also a look to uh maybe reduce your risk\nYou know not just by not investing in the market and we still want to be in that and the marked by every reduce your risk and understanding the risk involved in retirement the risk of a\nPicking a bad year to retire you know whatever happens a couple of months or a year before he retired in the stock market in your investments and what happens with your investments a couple of months or year after you retire at risk involved there they call it the sequence of returns\nAnd being able to keep up with the rising cost of living\nYou know your cost of living that the governments and making sure that your money last a lifetime right and

planning for your income and um you know we started off this uh this afternoon talking about the stock market and the risk involved\nIs there a way though to maybe avoid that risk and retirement or transfer that risk\nYou think about it so you can avoid rich you know you go back to when you're when you're younger you're told not to play with matches because they're dangerous or you avoid that risk right or the drive safely to avoid the risk of an accident\nUm there's also a way the transfer rich you know think of a your home in case something were to happen you have insurance on a right to transfer that risk over to the insurance company now there's a cost for that but when you're willing to pay that cause to transfer that risk\nHow's that work with your retirement income\nWell let's think about these risks and good dig deeper a little bit more into the three major risk and retirement one is your timing\nYou know picking a bad year to retire you know that you know they're retiring she'll be happier writer happy time but your investments you know you're not paying attention what happens with a couple months or a year before you retire and then a month or after you retire\nYou know the ups and downs you know there could be positive or could uh you know turn out to be not to not to positive writer could dramatically affect your income maybe not so much at the beginning but in the future and\nTo the insurance company now does it cost for that but when you're willing to pay that cause to transfer that risk\nHow's that work with your retirement income\nWell let's think about these risks and good dig deeper a little bit more into the three major risk and retirement one is your timing\nYou know picking a bad year to retire you know it's not you know they're retiring she'll be happier writer happy time but your investments you know if you're not paying attention what happens with a couple months or a year before you retire and then a month or after you retire\nYou know the ups and downs you know there could be positive or could uh you know turn out to be not to not to positive writer could dramatically affect your income maybe not so much at the beginning but in the future and being able to sustain that in common is very important for people\nYou get the timing right your money your money your income last to get the timing wrong your money will not last and you run out of money right\nSo what's the key here what do you do you know maybe you would to wait that segment your savings segment and start to position your assets your portfolio that vision in in a different way nothing stocks bonds cash\nHigh risk low risk cetera you know being more conservative but also start to look to position your assets asset location your investment your account location and how to start to generate the plan for income and retire\nSo what do we do maybe we\nSegment out I'm your portfolio or think of it as like a circle and a break it up you know the simple you know into fights and several slices or segments the first segment is going to be maybe your conservative side man right\nIt's got a job that has one job the money that allocated to this or conservative segment one job in one job only them provide income for you for the next five years or the you know the first five years of retirement\nAnd for main job to provide that monthly income for sixteen months you know and you know that income and it's got to be coming into the house so no matter what sixteen months five years of income um and uh you know have that income coming in\nPosition money then maybe in a second slice of pie or sacrament second segment that again you're going to not touch it for the next five years it's going to accumulate maybe aren't some interests you know maybe a little bit more conservative approach are still\nAnd now you're earning some interest for the first five years of retirement so that in years six it's going to take on the job of providing your main ... you know main job now providing income to you for the next five years from your six through town\nAnd maybe because of that money earned some a little bit of Ventura you'll be able to give yourself a little bit of the increase in your income your income way maybe we'll be higher\nAnd so really the first two segments or slice of the pie\nTheir goal is to provide monthly income for you for the first ten years the first ten years hundred and twenty a hundred and twenty months of income or knowing that your income words coming from\nNot concerned about the stock market you know for that income or whatever's going on in interest rates are and you know cost of living inflation you're and you're getting that income and you're giving yourself or right\nNow\nWe want to eventually still keep up with the cost of living in and generate income after the first ten years of of a retirement maybe reposition some money in it\nThat money earned some a little bit of Ventura you'll be able to give yourself a little bit of the increase in your income your income way maybe we'll be higher\nYou are really the first two segments or slice of pie\nTheir goal is to provide monthly income for you for the first ten years the first ten years hundred and twenty a hundred and twenty months of income or knowing that your income words coming from\nNot concerned about the stock market you know for that and calm or whatever's going on in interest rates are and you know cost of living inflation\nYou're you're getting that income and you're giving yourself or right now\n\nBecause we want to eventually still keep up with the cost of living in and generate income after the first ten years of of a retirement maybe reposition some money in a third slice of the pie or a third Simon\nIt's going to generate income perhaps it just for the next five years eleventh through Fifteen or maybe for a longer period of time\nDepending on how you want to structure that\nThat's where you can perhaps put in those income writer titled accounts that will generate that sustainable guaranteed income\nTo you no matter what happens to your investment um and it will continue again they'll guarantee of those ... those rider those income writers typically offered to the new the programs the guarantee of the of offered to those programs all backed by the claims pain ability of the insurance company that offers there nobody\nBut it's a possibility that this is where that could be fit in into the model\nLet it grow for a couple of years let the guaranteed build up and then started to generate that income and they generate that income for five years from the segment or possibly even longer for your lifetime\nAgain then also didn't segment some money into a force slice of the pie or fourth segment\nThat we know maybe we got there we will we do now we got Fifteen Years are not touching that money\nWe can maybe invest that take advantage of historical a past performance or hopefully and generate some nice returns overtime still be smart about it now to sit there by and hold it but look to manager and minimize downturns\nAnd then ... help degenerate and recycle everything and start the process over again\nAnd generate income from sixteen you're sixteen you're on and continue in in conjunction with um income coming in from the third place in the pie\nYou know sometimes you want to add maybe a fifth or sixth segment depending on how a everybody's different but how you want to generate that income\nAnd then all while making sure that that incomes going to still come into the house so\nIn case you're not around and for your spouse and then eventually pass it on to beneficiaries right\nI'm here to help you out let's talk more shares some ideas see if I
