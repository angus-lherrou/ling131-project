insurance Dr Edward contract and thank you so much for joining me this Sunday we're going to be talking about a very important topic cataracts and if you're close to fifty or certainly over the age of fifty chances are you having early cataract\nAnd if you have advanced cataracts and you're contemplating surgery then please listen to what I have to tell you\nWell just about everyone over the age of fifty begins to have cataracts and\nWe're going to be addressing what you need to do to slow the progression of the cataract in in some cases even reverse the cataracts to prevent the need for surgery\nI became interested in giving this a radio show talking about the topic of cataracts\nWhen I discovered that the majority of searches on my website healing vi dot com are related to cataracts so I think the baby boomers are getting older and they're developing cataracts and they want to know what to do\nI came across a book that was written in Eighteen eighty bike Compton Burnett who was homeopathic doctor\nAnd he gave some really great advice\nIn addition this book then I'll be talking about this later or he discussed several homeopathic remedies that are found effective for reversing cataracts\nAh he gave suicide advice he stated that there's three things you need to do\nIf you're developing a cataract or you're if you're interested in preventing a cataract number one\nIs to avoid sugar and there have been some studies to show that increasing sugar in your diet leads to Chris Liz nation as a lens and the progression of the cataract\nHe also felt very firmly that you should reduce your salt intake\nSo salt\nAlso can be related to the development of cataract and the last thing he commented on is to avoid harder to water and I thought this was particularly interesting because\nIf you have a hard water in your home it's going to begin to develop a film or coating on your pipes and you're going to get Cal suffocation of the plumbing in your home\nAnd the cataract is kind of like Cal suffocation of the human lens so there's been another a study that I read that alcohol and water\nAnd you may have been hearing that you really need to shift your body ph more towards an alkaline state and alkaline water is a soft water it's when do you have\nAn acidic water hard water that you have a lot more minerals president that I think could be contributing to a cataract so those three things were greater\nRelated to the development of cataract and the last thing he commented on is to avoid harder to water\nAnd I thought this was particularly interesting because\nIf you have a hard water in your home it's going to begin to develop a film or coating on your pipes and you're going to get ... vacation of the plumbing in your home\nAnd the cataract is kind of like ... vacation of the human lens so there's been another\nA study that I read that alcohol and water and you may have been hearing that you really need to shift your body ph more towards an alcohol in the state and alkaline water is a soft water it's when you have\nAn acidic water hard water that you have a lot more minerals president that I think could be contributing to a cataract so those\nThree things were great advice from a book written in the Eighteen eighties\nAvoid sugar salt\nAnd hard water\nI started out as an I search it and I felt there wasn't any disease that I couldn't cut and put back together again\nWelcome back to help you she sure has Dr ... Khan drive and today we're talking about cataracts\nI mentioned some physiological things that take place in your eye when you develop a cataract and researchers find that in the in Queens humor this was a fluid that surrounds the lenses ear I being scored big accents levels decreased and ... levels decrease in the ...\nSo it makes common sense that if you want to reverse these cataracts you should probably begin to do things to increase the score and score but gas levels are vitamin C. and Nicholas iron levels now another researcher\nHad made the comment that perhaps cataract is a form of phone calls curvy\nNow what do I mean by phone call scurry well\nSurely is a condition where you have vitamin C. deficiency\nYou as a complete lack of vitamin C. your diet and this is a severe disease that could lead to death you have a breakdown of your college in tissue bleeding\nIt is very it's rare as long as I'm common to see cases it's curvy United States\nBecause my goodness there's even some vitamin C. and fruit loop cereal and it's supplemented in many different food sources but this idea of ...\nThe score but a score but gas levels are vitamin C. and Nicholas iron levels now another researcher\nHad made the comment that perhaps cataract is a form of so called ... curvy now what do I mean by phone call ...\n... is a condition where you have vitamin C. deficiency\nYou as a complete lack of either in senior diet and this is a severe disease that could lead to death you have a breakdown of your college in tissue bleeding\nAnd it's very it's rare it's almost I'm common to see cases it's curvy United States\nBecause my goodness there's even some vitamin C. and fruit loop cereal and it's supplemented in many different food sources but this idea of focus curvy\nThat we're just not receiving enough ... to fight off the stress and toxins in our environment\nAnd this researcher felt that\nPeriod Donald disease an arterial sclerosis and cataracts our farm in a scourge are starving\nWhen we're under stress our body needs more vitamin C.\nAnd unfortunately humans have a genetic defect well we're not able to make any vitamin C. at all\nOr when I had my ranch in central Florida we had goats and I discovered that goats when they're under stress can make a hundred grams of vitamin C a day yes you heard me right a hundred grand ... a day\nAnd unfortunately humans whatever under stress we can't even make one tenth of a milligram of vitamin C.\nSo one of the things I advise my patients who have cataracts begin to increase the dose of vitamin C. that your tank you and I recommend that you take between three and five grams a day of vitamin C.\nBut you have to be careful because sometimes\nIf you take the vitamin C.\nOr into large of a quantity theories are where you can have a ... mile diarrhea so\nBegin with gradually increasing your vitamin C. and maybe taking get equally throughout the day with a urine else it's also important that you select the right vitamin C.\nYou don't want to be taking vitamin C. made from corn there's a couple of problems with that because the vitamin C. made from corn comes from genetically modified court\nAnd you also want to be careful that you inquire that the vitamin C. is not from China\nOne study indicated that eighty percent of all vitamin C. comes from China\nAnd these vitamins probably have high levels of talks like arsenic lead and other poisonings\nThe various substance that may be contributing to your cataracts so increase your vitamin C. levels\nYou need to begin to increase your glucose iron levels in your body glue aside and there's a\nPowerful anti accident\nThat is extremely effective is improving your immune system and decreasing inflammation\nSo I'm going to share with you some glue to fire the containing foods\nAnd your mother was right\nIt easy knees each or spinach broccoli\nBrussel sprouts et cetera all these students are extremely high included ... partially is also high other Cato asparagus\nHave high levels of talks like arsenic let other poisonings\nThe various substance that may be contributing to your cataracts so increase your vitamin C. levels\nYou need to begin to increase your glucose iron levels in your body glue aside and there's a\nAnti accident\nThat is extremely effective is improving your immune system and decreasing inflammation\nSo I'm going

very effective that you could put it on your skin and some companies are making a life ...\nThe problem is you can't take including a sigh on capsule because it's broken up with a digestive ass and seeing their stomach\nSo if you are interested\nOr in some of these clueless I own supplements and if you are interested in getting that you're a test that I talked about\nGive the officer

the time Jesus spoke it was only one group of people who called Abraham their father and you also had Moses the profits as their teachers the facts were then true of the nation of Israel\nYou think then that the rich man represents the natural descendants of Abraham as a nation is it possible for one man to represent the whole\nNation indeed this is still quite customary for example Uncle Sam and also John ... these two symbolic represent nations do they not\nI I catch your point about the rich man of the parable was dressed in purple and find lemon and he ate some Jewish Li every day I presume that that has a\nMeaning what isn't main purple has been used as a symbol of royalty to Abraham the father of the nation God promised that his seed should bus all the nations of the earth that's was fitting that the rich man should be dressed in a royal color\nYou see Ross the details mentioned concerning this rich men harmonize very beautifully with us ingestion that he was symbolic of the natural descendants of Abraham\nAll right but in that not all around us to the parable the rich man died and inhale he lifted up his eyes being and torment doesn't that indicate the possibility of people being tormented after they die\nLettuce examined the facts just as a parable relates them this rich man died and was buried and then he lifted up his eyes being in torment and we all know that the body we burying the grave does not and cannot lift up its eyes this is one of the strongest proof that this whole account is a parable\nOkay\nThen what does the death of the rich man

them\nThis rich man died and was buried and then he lifted up his eyes being in torment and we all know that the body we bury the grape does not and cannot lift up its eyes this is one of the

Israel was in trouble was only a little while after this that Israel died as a nation and our people scattered among the gentile kingdoms\nThat is true enough I I Know and uh\nRemember the parable says the rich man was tormented inhale\nArrest so many centuries before this the lord through Moses Ford told the persecution of would come up on this nation Israel\nHeller Haiti's means a condition of death in the case of individuals who die and go into Haiti he's the scripture state they are conscious\nBut in the parable it as a nation that dies while the people continue to live and during the time of their national death the fires of persecution and continue to rage against them as individuals\nYour thought them is not a nation that is the nation of Israel went into oblivion while the people as individuals continue to live an suffer that's the thought exactly\nBut what about the poor beggar of the terrible at Lazarus he died too you know and he was carried by the angels two Abrahams ... them and what does that represent\nThe bigger was a picture of the poverty of the ... up to that time that is their poverty pertaining to their relationship to God\nAnd to the promises of

what we do we try to help groups that kill the ... foundation um to get the word out to people and let people know that are out there whether to get help or to get involved and help them because you know do the help that they do\nService dogs or you know the dogs that veterans or does it help kids are um you know we all have to Canaan story too that we rotate around the valley looking at the canines that working are different police\nDepartment and it just so ... of the stories about the community\nYeah I Would love to do that with your sometime when you go around and talk and then did maybe do some interviews with you and the police officers were their canines because they're just wonderful animals now when they get the moving you know like when they're when they go after a bad guy or a bad girl you can't stop all you have you ever seen him in action\nAnd I I got a dog just like it that's why didn't bring them into the studio when we're having that twenty Daniel 'cause that guy right there you know he's like the start of the the the block right anyway right I'd love to do that with you sometimes what when you're working with canine you're out what the police and everything what's the biggest concerns that that you heard from them\nLook for them is\nSafety for their dogs mostly and so there's some great nonprofits that actually raise money and they buy the best dogs and you know they play on the gear that the officers need\nFor the game and I can say say if what if some what were the best car do you know you know that I Believe they're around it yeah I Believe they're around a thousand dollars you know the ... because the dogs have to be able to run\nFor animals now when they get to move and you know like when they're when they go after a bad guy or a bad girl you can't stop all you have you ever seen them in action\nAnd I I got a dog just like it that's why didn't bring him into the studio when we have in that twenty Daniel 'cause that guy right there you know he's like the start of the the the block right anyway right I'd love to do that with you some time so what when you're working with canine you're out with the police and everything what's the biggest concerns that that you heard from them\nLook for them is safety for their dogs mostly and so there's some great nonprofits that actually raise money and they buy the best for dogs and you know they buy all the gear that the officers need for the game and I can say say it would have some what would a vast cost\nYou know you know I don't believe they're around it yeah I Believe they're around a thousand dollars you know the capital are because the dogs have to be able to run full speed and jumped and ... ... that's on so they are about a thousand bucks\nRight and we added a trainer that helped train Capone here and he's about\nA police dog training between a police dog in an army dog type training so he's got along and raining in them and um but you know they can get aggressive they're um you know 'cause they're big dogs right so they're not right and not the kinds but the service than I could have gotten a lot of money wrapped up in service San jose you ever seen a\nCombination of at do you recommend somebody wanting to do service dog and get them like a drug or so he's got the um you know your drug a training where you know he can sniff out drugs\nAnd stuff like that he's going to do the bomb training next which is a heavy duty training son but um yeah they do you ever recommend mixing stuff like that or you think they should just stick to their own little areas\nWhere I'm certainly not as a train or service dyke expert but I and within a lot and from what I understand they have to the surface typically they want to ignore other dogs are barely acknowledge other dry\nOn because they they are doing the work they want they need to be focused on their handler another person versus interacting with other dogs Ryan typically that's the same with the canine canines and they go into a building and there's a dog they are trained to ignore the dog\nMhm I think I have my my uh ... pounds a little bit confused because he's got both the training and I put a lot of money in the service animal training I mean that's really where we started with him and uh you know because we wanted to be able to take in places and I carry he likes his little certificate stuff they his ah\nUm service animal in training with me I mean we have real training is not one of them are fake ones that you get on line right but um that's ideal is a big deal it is a big deal I mean he's ... you didn't get to make the palm but he's so well I'm mannered so to speak I mean he knows how to act when he's in public\nBut um anyway so I like what you do over there and

eight six six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com\nWell given all the choices that us politicians have to make and we trust the new make good ones should they be required to take cognitive and psychological chats and I love the idea I'm not sure how practical it is or whether it's constitutional but\nDr Henry Miller talked about wrote about it and he's a senior fellow at the Pacific research Institute and frankly a great asset to the show and a great friend of the show Dr Miller welcome back on\nThank you Ira it's great to be with you\nSo what do you think about the idea of requiring that elected officials and I take it from Capitol Hill out to every state legislature and maybe every city council and county commission is this practical\nWell to be clear ah I'm not suggesting that in the article that it'd be required I'm suggesting that politicians subject to a thaw entirely and that the vote if they don't or if they don't do it the voters punish them at the ballot box\nThat's a great free market approach to it isn't it\nI I think so so in the same way that we are like two or insist on a knowing whether open heart surgery was successful in a prominent politician or brain surgery more to the point\nUm we we could do it for for just general or intelligence and mental status and psychopathology testing and so on I think uh I think it has merit\nTo a doctor you think that there are are there some tests out there for which we have enough of a you know sort of a baseline to know that the tests are reliable that they don't create false positives either of\nFalsely tell us that somebody is a genius or falsely tell us that somebody has a little on the crazy side where you might be able to say well if you take one of these it'll just help reassure the voters that you're doing All right and nobody has to be afraid it's going to produce a result there's going to pay them as a lunatic\nYeah there there actually are some good ones and uh you know some of it is clearly subjective so when a psychiatrist or tries to measure or evaluate your son does knowledge and your incite a and your intelligence and your memory that's that's all\nStatus and psychopathology testing and so on I I think uh I think it has merit\nTo a doctor you think that there are are there some tests out there for which we have enough of a you know sort of a baseline to know that the tests are reliable that they don't create false positives either of\n... tell us that somebody is a genius or falsely tell us that somebody has a little on the crazy side where you might be able to say well if you take one of these it'll just help reassure the voters that you're doing All right and nobody has to be afraid it's going to produce a result there's going to paint them as a lunatic\nYeah there there actually are some good ones and uh you know some of it is clearly subjective so when a psychiatrist or tries to measure or evaluate your fund of knowledge and your incite a and your intelligence and your memory\nThat's that's all pretty subjective but psychologist had come have come up over the years with tests like the MPR the Minnesota multi phase a personality into tore a that consists in its usual form of five hundred and sixty seven questions\nAnd that comes up with pretty good measures\nOf ten a clinical\nParameters are like ... type of dry SSN psycho pathology and belligerence and and so on as well as for\nA scales that ah that\nTend to shed light on the ... of the other test so if you try to\nGive them the answers you want normal answers normal people answers to it can detect it because it asks questions in several different ways and a kind of looks for inconsistencies so I think I think there are pretty good ways to do that when the ... the tests are performed by professionals\nI use I checked out one time a couple of three decades ago 'cause I thought it'd be interesting I kept hearing about the M M B. I not that I don't take it is\nFull of some very strange questions and you're right there is some hidden ways to test whether somebody is telling the truth or not or just trying to gain the results but you put forward the example of Pete Domenici first uh end of the idea that\nHe came out and told the public look I've I've got this uh did degenerative disease or the wasting away the funneling temporal lobes\nAnd he was nice to be honest with the public about what was going on but it tests like that might have really reassured people or perhaps suggested to the member of Congress or senator or that they are they really don't have any business doing the job anymore [noise]\n[noise] yeah I think that's an excellent example and you know another very topical one is uh of course we we all know that a Senator McCain recently passed away from a\nBrain cancer and a arguably he really should have resigned a retired\nWhen uh the severity of that was discovered and think about where we would have been today with a cap and all that kind of confirmation if he had been in in his uh sick bat in Arizona too ill to go to Washington to vote\nThat's a practical example of debilitate Asian\nUh that really arguably should have dictated a resignation\nBy the way a doctor I through this idea out awhile ago because we did have that question of whether or not something will be approved could hang on when the vote is taken and whether somebody's in town or out of town that sort of thing\nI suggested that in this day and age when you can buy a house in signed the mortgage documents and you know signed them electronically or send them you know ... over wire scanned them and then send them back\nThat are members of Congress should have the ability of voting electronically funny enough in their own chambers\nThat was discovered and think about where we would have been today with the cats and on confirmation if he had been in in his uh sick bat in Arizona too ill to go to Washington to vote that's a practical example of debilitate Asian\nUh that really arguably should have dictated a resignation\nAnd by the way a doctor I through this idea out awhile ago because we did have that question of whether or not something will be approved could hang on when the vote is taken and whether somebody's in town or out of town and that sort of thing I suggested that in this day and age when you can buy a house and signed the mortgage documents and\nYou know signed them electronically or send them you know ... over wire scanned them and then send them back\nThat are members of Congress should have the ability of voting electronically funny enough in their own chambers they do vote electronically but you have to be physically present in the Senate or physically present in the house to push the button or would it make sense you have say you know that there's a senator from um a Montana\nOr deans who is going to beat his daughter's wedding tomorrow so he has to vote before he goes or go to the wedding and then quickly fly back to D.C to cast a ballot should we at some point consider maybe the idea of\nAllowing the senators to vote remotely might allow him to spend a lot more time in their district to their constituents and a lot more time away from the lobbyists in Capitol Hill\nAbsolutely laws makes perfect sense and uh there are ways to definitively verify that it is that person voting and you could do it in a book\nBy something like Skype so that you see a a the counter could actually see that the person was casting his well yeah it was a little\nYou know it's funny doctor I don't know if you were Henry and I've been friends for a long time but uh I Know that there is a case I Know about recently a ... among some friends or acquaintances where somebody had to be on a regular a breathalyzer check and I said how do they make sure that it's actually this woman who's taking the breathalyzer and they said well\nThey have a device attached to your smartphone\nAnd you have to actually look at the camera and be verified as being the person who's actually blowing into the tube showing your your blood alcohol content if they're doing multiple tests you know per week to assure that you've not gone back to the bottle\nAnd I thought well heck if you did that kind of thing with senators senator ... smartphone\nA show his retinas to the camera phone my my\nPhone will do that it'll confirm who you are by retina it'll confirming who you are by fingerprint you can do two or three levels and say we know absolutely that's the person who press the button and cast a vote and then the senators could vote from anywhere and they wouldn't have to you know make sure they're on Capitol Hill to actually cast the votes we want them to be involved in\nAbsolutely technology can do that with the with the great fidelity these days you're absolutely right\nNow the other thing you brought up is you think there might be a reason that Nancy Pelosi needs a test\nYeah in the article a I had links to a couple of videos of her speaking and she's not as she doesn't seem to be affected all the time but there have been a few instances over the past year or so where she slurs her words can find a word\nAnd that is what I Would consider way outside the bounds of normal uh ability to express herself so\nWe're we're going to have to watch that wouldn't surprise me if and when she was deposed as a majority leader as a leader of the Dems and the house that she decides to retire I don't think she's well\nWith great fidelity these days you're absolutely right now the other thing you brought up\nIs you think there might be a reason that Nancy Pelosi needs to test\nYeah in the article a I had links to a couple of videos of her speaking and she's not she doesn't seem to be affected all the time but there has been a few instances over the past year or so where she slurs or words can find a word\nAnd that is what I Would consider way outside the bounds of normal or the ability to express herself so um\nWe're we're going to have to watch that wouldn't surprise me if and when she has to pose as a majority leader as a leader of the U.S in the house that she decides to retire I don't think she's well\nNow wants to have her on the court it'll bring out the anti papers among the laugh I'm so that sounds great\nBut on the other hand I kind of think Trump should appoint a man I don't know what man but some man because we've seen ... book now any man they nominate we better Republican nominee for this or is going to be accused of rape on you're never going to drag out a bunch of lunatics they'll bring out and Julie sweating the can down and\n... ... yeah okay um they're evil and often do what they don't mind working evil they do mind looking implausible\nBy the way you should know that in colder results when the attorney in a very climbing above the law degrees clerked for important people or Justice Thomas in all let me ask you a legal question I don't do that very often but you see in the wall Street Journal reporter I imagine that shows that Leland Kaiser the longtime friend of\nOf a Christian Ford says that she was leaned on by people she told the FBI the tree was leaned on to treat injured story from\nI wasn't there I don't know Brett Kavanaugh I don't know anything about it through apparently to a story that said she was going to back up Christine Ford which would be I think if it's possible more than one eighty or from I don't know anything to I remember the incident\nUse is not a criminal act to you know to to go out and try to inform somebody to lie to the FBI enhanced to Congress in a process like this where is that just something that's just terribly wrong but doesn't actually break any laws\nI think I I haven't looked up to the federal budget on that but it is certainly a crime to uh try to get someone to perjure themselves and quite closely related to\nTune perjury well it was longer I I I signed on assigned oath statement yeah absolutely as a crime if it was just in talking to Senate Democrats I'm not saying it under oath um\nIsn't there I don't know Brett Kavanaugh I don't know anything about it through apparently to a story that said she was going to back up Christine Ford which would be I think if if it's possible more than a one eighty or from I don't know anything to I remember the incident use is not a criminal act to you know to to go out and try to inform somebody to lie to the\nFBI enhanced the congressman or process like this where is that just something that's just terribly wrong but doesn't actually break any laws\nOh I see I I haven't looked up to the federal budget on that but it is certainly a crime to uh try to get someone to perjure themselves and quite closely related to\nTo perjury well it was on that I assigned a assigned oath statement yeah absolutely and the crime if it was just in talking to Senate Democrats are not saying it under oath\nUm possibly could day I'm speaking to a government official the FBI agents\nBut yeah it absolutely they should and they've got\nA problem here I Am so sick of Republicans and this is one of the wonderful things have gotten out of trunk he's showing showing Republicans how fun it is to attack back for one for Republicans always want to be the gun sports like oh okay we want in the end we got we got cabin on the court no no no no no a statement has to be made this\nWill never happen again you will not for someone like this and will destroy his life like\nThat I couldn't agree more now now what should we you've said don't trot out somebody else but let's say\nThat ah Ruth Bader Ginsburg leaves the court in the next two years before the end of this term and I anticipate a second term because of everything good that's going on ... what can we do proactively\nTo shame the Democrats I Know they have no shame but what can we do to shame them to say don't try this again because private can't\nProsecute prosecute prosecute\nI Want to know who leaked the letter on that was given and confidence to two on the Senate I've all Feinstein thing where they have to get a lot of that they know the name of the guy who was instantly producing the home addresses and phone numbers of Republican senators on and said that liberals couldn't couldn't bone loss\nBar them that's known as doc thing on and and we do have some perjury charges including for I Know they love playing a judge Kavanaugh oh it's perjury it's perjury he\nHe didn't say he say he drank excessively no I I I think he kind of didn't say no more than that\nI mean it's either falls or or selling us what they are claiming is is perjury we while\nChristine lazy afford not to be confused with Dr for number one she's not a medical doctor number two she's not even a psychologist she lied about four things she lied about her fear of flying up um she lied about the polygraph\nTest she lied about needing ... to a second front door I'm actually lied about being a psychologist statements under oh\nDo you think that the Republicans have the guts to prosecute her for that because this I mean here's a here's my rule for that and now I'm not I'm a non lawyer I think if if you lie under oath I think the technical you know the the ... punishment is lying under oath is perjury\nAnd in many cases they don't go after it because it's not ... it may be important but it's not consequential this was hugely consequential this could have literally changed American history\nFor the next decades so with such a consequential result lying under oath in this case should absolutely be be prosecuted to the phones degrees along\nYeah also we have to send a shot across and Democrats\nThe second son door I'm I feel about being a psychologist statements under oh\nDo you think that the Republicans have the guts to prosecute her for that because this I mean here's a here's my rule for that and now I'm not on the non lawyer I think if if you lie under oath I think the technical you know the the ... punishment is lying under oath is perjury\nAnd in many cases they don't go after it because it's

real I mean it had an occult system is expanding buddies makes behind it\nWell they've been a lot of uh a holes lately\nThat have said that a lot of young people today are more into secularism they're looking at science to find the answers to a lot of spiritual questions and of this is something that I think is a quite a disturbing because what this does is we failed it a lot of ways I think\nUh we we have failed in a teaching our children are a lot of the things regarding spirituality\nA teacher ... a lot of things that are\nYou know put them in a position to be a you know believers in God or at least having a spiritual sense but the spiritual sense was completely destroyed and this is certainly the grueling Generation Z for and I said this I said you know the future is about you and me it's about Generation Z and they know that they know that if they can get them while they're young and\nHaving teachers go in and giving them the global loose the oratory and all the things they do they know they're going to have these kids prepared for except in this new world order which would be a new world order not just in a\nA discount it in government but in religious beliefs and a number of other things that they're going to be a you know trying to push on people and so a lot of kids a lot of young people today are turning to be a cold and uh this is something that are in fact I think if you read the open conspiracy if you read\nA new world order these are books by H. G. wells\nWho was a fiction writer but he said since he was a baby in socialist who said that the agenda the agenda is going to be a winning over the young people are having them fight for this and doing so by grooming them and changing their views on everything from government to religion\n\nAnd again there are renting ... temples all over the country and they're doing all this thing oh St national where just tend to libertarianism in human empowerment but that's not what real satanism Israel satanism is about total domination of reality and many other people submit your wealth it's not about empowering individuals went off\nWell and you got a number of different uh I guess you could call them groups is fading\nTurning to be a cold and uh this is something that are in fact I think if you read the open conspiracy if you read a new world order these are books by H. G. wells\nWho was a fiction writer but he said uh since he was a baby in socialist he said that the agenda the agenda is going to be a winning over the young people are having them fight for this and doing so by grooming them and changing their views on everything from government to religion\nAnd again there are renting ... capitals all over the country and they're doing all this thing oh St national origin stand to libertarianism and human empowerment\nBut that's not what real sickness room as real satanism about total domination of reality and many other people submit your well it's not about empowering individuals went off\nWell and you got a number of different uh I guess you could call them groups of statements ... van statements which\nThey got people claiming her ... really are that's what I kind of act like shocking but what was it was well tell me what you think are all ... says Francis illicit faring\nWell most of the Koreans are kind of a ... type individuals who are looking for knowledge and they use loose versus the symbol for knowledge and inviting them and what you're looking at state and however the following one\nThere are people who use state and there's an icon of basically atheism saying well I don't believe in God or the devil and so they call themselves Satan is for lack of a better term or what they really are secularists heating is ...\nBut when you look at somebody who is actually atheistic\nStatements or you look at a a number of a religious organization that call themselves like with a couple of sat or you talk about the same kind of example those who are crucial in bringing for these statues of bathroom in the public square\nA and of course the arch of bail where they tell you oh you are your bail is representation of peace and freedom when the reality is a representation of sexual orgies\nPromiscuity and a baby killing and or is it exactly what they brought up during the whole Kavanaugh F word a debate or the earring is whether or not a\nA Brett Kavanaugh was a sexual predator and what his positions will be once he's confirmed as a as a you know as a as a judge or is it the Supreme Court script or justice\nThat was ... what is he going to do with the the idea of reproductive freedom as they call it\nUh it's all about abortion it's all about baby killing it's all about sex it's all about homosexual sex but devil's triangle all these buzz words that ah people like show the White House we're just so happy to ah basically parade around the hearing\nAnd to talk about this was something that really made me feel uncomfortable because uh you know it's certainly smack of a lot of a cult buzzwords recalling a twilight language if you will just basically spreading a the hidden agendas\nAnd let's come back and it's a hard subject I like ... he's a good guy his energy positive trying to fix things he's trying to get a question train 'em by having a Bush many in\nKarl Rove man and they're all skill involved and you get into that area in the east coast salad I\nCatalogue got a pretty good voting record but I'm going to be honest\nThat will try and hold on a train game in is when I was a talk\nShow let's look at it [noise]\nWhat's going on with Kavanaugh\nSaid he'd be the ultimate Trojan Horse rabbi\nWe're bringing back one of the biggest thing in secret formula we ever offered even veteran Greek [noise] both bones raw\nThe subject I like Trump good guy his energies positive we try to fix things and trying to get 'em ... train them by having all of the Bush many and\nKarl Rove men and they're all going bone and you get it on the east coast rushed out at a\nCatalog got a pretty good voting record but I'm gonna be honest here\nTrying all is not a drain game it is when I was a draw\nShow let's look at it [noise]\nWhat's really going on with Kavanaugh\nThought he'd be the ultimate Trojan Horse rabbi\nWe're bringing back one of the biggest thing favorite formula we've ever offered was even veteran Greece ultimately bone bra\nBecause he's not part of that system it was like what Newt Gingrich says he hasn't gone through the rituals having gone through the ah the hazing process he was a man and a guy who does his own thing who says his own rules he doesn't bow or answer\nTo any secrets societal mayhem um you may know of it but it certainly doesn't know to have to deal with it I don't think as much as the others do they know how to deal with the secret handshake some enzymes symbol you know it's funny because\nIt was just blown up past all that he just bought his secret China's economy doing well\nWell yeah I mean if you if you read any a post modern philosophy like by John ... who said that we're living in times were symbols mean more than reality

Dale around both families to track and I hope the media will kind of come out and start saying look\nThis could have all been avoided if we're not on drugs or not committing the crime and we pay the officers command this this peanuts grow at all police officers out through the African Americans it's yeah it's not true and the media seems to run with it\nAnd they hurt and Curt any crime on yeah color gimme gimme gimme your\nTake from your perspective 'cause you've walked in officer Van Dyke shoes um you watch the video the whole case do you think the jury kinda got it right\nThat the jury made a decision that for that except that its use on both sides and the yeah probably got it right on that but the media needs to make sure they don't grow as this is how everything half there's got to be part sixteen shots\nFired at the same thing how many rounds human body yeah or they go down there though\nA direct threat but your heart what's happening now that's\nA sample for everything you know they are committing crimes say man and not put them in that\nNeck and what needs to be here and when you know yeah more or African American children being held in gangs and and we're not are kind of thing that that may maybe on 'em and\nThey're back off to maybe make that happen\nAnd we take and then that is a horrible and author God what is our\nPhone when I got an opinion that they're going to say\nThank you my brother Kurt thank you my man thank you and I I I have very little faces the media will do any of what you say\nAnd I have all the fear in the world that the media is just going to pile on top of not just officer Van Dyke but er Cox again in general let me go to Kate Kate\nHi Joe how are you how are you\nI'm going to give 'em a point of view from someone who has a daughter who is Chicago police officer and I have to say that this was known that dream today I'm without having to repeat what everybody is already talked about I'm going to be the voice for a police officer\nWho basically for Fifteen Years I think it's unclear his job he never won an of fire a weapon at anybody and I've heard you and I've heard other people speak about well why didn't he look why didn't he slowed\nThe media will do any of what you say and I have all the fear in the world that the media is just going to pile on top of not just officer Van Dyke but a cockroach again in general let me go to Kate tied their Kate\nHi Joe how are you how are you I'm going to give 'em a point of view from someone who has a daughter who is Chicago police officer and I have to say that this was not a victory today\nI'm without having to repeat what everybody's already talked about I'm going to be the voice for a police officer\nWho basically for Fifteen Years did it I guess I'm Larry job he never once had a fire a weapon at anybody and I've heard you and I've heard other people speak about well why didn't he look why didn't he slowed down why did he do that [noise]\nMy daughter said it pretty clearly that the first time you have to pull your gone out of your house or you know it's so split second yeah you can't help but think one I'm here to do my job\nI'm here to serve and protect not myself only but everybody else yeah um we can say what we want about the victim\nWe can say what we want about Jason Van Dyke but what we did today as we've made somebody a sacrificial lamb and we basically tied in the hands of our police department for\nEver and I literally cry today over that anti I said hey\nI I so appreciate your perspective into your daughter thank you for for service\nWill do thank you just\nCan't think thank you for your thoughts in your opinion I\nI ... I'm ... I'm sad about it too because\nLook I think the reactions going to be stupid I think the reaction on our side or I I got all the respect in the world from aids Jackson and I I understand\nThat the reaction in uh the black community in Chicago they're going to feel good about this I get that and I understand that um but like like uh the Brett Kavanaugh facing\nWas not about the me too movement and it's not about old women it was about did Brett Kavanaugh do this\nOr this officer Jason Van Dyke thing is not about\nA cop shooting black men in black violence in the city it's about did officer Van Dyke commit murder that's all justice but we want to create and blow out of proportion all of these other narratives that fit where we are politically this is a sad day\nFor me Kate I think a lot of people it's a sad day as well\nI'm not because I disagree with the verdict\nI just think it's a sad day for cops\nWill will continue with this I'm Joe Walsh don't go anywhere\n[noise]\nIt's time to

with with regard to a surgery ... a few more therapy and radiation will be called the big three\nAnd so when their physicians diagnose cancer they refer them to the colonists and that's what the

locations one in Chandler\nOr no excuse me one in Gilbert and wanting costs are ground her name is Gail Schmidt and what I like about buffalo wild wings is not only that they have wild wings but they

what I say you know when I got this guy said what's find dangle I didn't even know what it was [laughter] but anyway All right Joe I Know you're chafing at the bit to talk about politics\nAnd what happened in the last couple of weeks so why don't you started off gimme your uh idea and you're segments and what you think and then I'll chime in and tell you what I think well and we'll go from there\nAll right there's been so many people that have been so divided and it's it's really hard to understand\nWhy it would be a so difficult for people to just you know allow each other to see things a little differently from one another but if we can maintain a little bit of honesty in the process and stick closer to things like\nA ... hour rule of law I'm\nWhen you've got somebody making an accusation against someone else\nAnd they\nFor whatever reason wait so incredibly long to bring it out\nYou have to wonder what the reason for bringing it out is you know in in a thirty six year period somebody might just more or less get over some some things of that sort especially from that early early age and it wasn't as traumatic as some you know a physical\nAttacks can be I don't believe in especially if people are having a few beers or whatever but\nIt's just odd to me that uh if you can't prove anything you're saying and it's that old memory and your that young and drinking at the time and the other person comes up an absolutely you know denies anything of the kind and then you named the people that you\nKnow that were around ... one of them will support what you're saying right none of 'em remembers\nAnything of the kind you know I've I've got grand daughters that are you know in that age and I'm In fact one of my granddaughter turned Thirteen I just said oh great now we've got a PMS Thirteen member in the house you know [laughter] ah [laughter]\nEarly age and it wasn't as traumatic as some you know a physical attacks can be I don't believe in especially if people are having a few beers or whatever but\nIt's just odd to me that uh if you can't prove anything you're saying\nAnd it's that old memory and your that young and drinking at the time\nAnd the other person comes up an absolutely you know denies anything of the kind\nAnd then you name the people that you know that were around and are not a one of them will support what you're saying right none of 'em remembers anything of the kind you know I've I've got grand daughters that are you know in that age yeah\nIn fact one of my granddaughter turned Thirteen I just said oh great now we've got a PMS Thirteen member in\nThe house you know [laughter] ah [laughter] because\nYou know she's so emotional and so forth flighty about things and she'll she'll tell me things I said to her you know\nLike I'm looking for those biblical science in the sky when the planets are going to a line and all these kinds of things and she comes up to me as as you said everybody was going to die and I said [laughter] ever said the thing like ... where did you get that [laughter] I said she's just a chain and their emotional and sometimes they have flights a fancy so\nYou know that you mentioned that uh I've been talking a quite a few psychics amused have on another radio shows of affiliated with\nAnd we're going to bring a few of them on here oh OK psychics mediums salmon is the type people and was conscious yeah I've had all those type people and they're all different okay uh-huh they all have one thing in common\nAt this place here in Sedona oh yeah [laughter] they all come once a year you know whatever's happening up in Sedona yeah uh I've heard it so many times\nBut I could tell you stories about having them on a year and you're telling me who's behind me a witch changeable behind me who is you know me telling me this telling me that\nYeah but you know what people say you know how come you never see psychic wins the lottery [laughter] never see stuff like that and I don't know\nIs other stuff with Tara cars and everything but we are going to be in ... really get into that but anyway going\nBack a little ... the political thing is just it's just that you know I Know people were so convinced because the person told a convincing story and you know I'm just thinking well they're both telling convincing stories now you have to go with what can be proven then you can't\nCondemn somebody just on the word of someone else I mean it just it may be an unfortunate way to do it but I in some people's opinions but I mean they have to follow the rule of law\nRight I think the way I see it mhm what was her name the gals name I Can't remember his horn for Dr Ford you know I think they set her up I really do it could be who is a point it could be and uh the way that Feinstein\nThere's some of these people I Can't even stand okay yeah you know and uh but I think now she's between a rock and our place she didn't say anything against it now to commit perjury\nAnd and everybody's going to look at him and wonder so I mean his family and everybody they're ... they're just going to be you know basically carrying this around the rest of their lives and that it's just not right I mean if if you can't say where and when something happened to you then the police won't even investigate it\nBut if you bring it up at a time like this right before the ... they've got the information in July and they wait until September to launch it at the last minute to hold up the process it looks a little too organized and coordinated to\nI think that's wrong immigrants or going to pay heavily with this election coming\nThe way that Feinstein there's so many people I Can't even stand okay yeah you know and uh but I think now she's between a rock and she'd say anything against it now to commit perjury\nAnd and everybody's going to look at him and wonder so I mean his family and everybody they're ... they're just going to be you know basically carrying this around the rest of their lives and it's it's just not right I mean if if you can't say where and when something happened to you than the police won't even investigated\nBut if you bring it up at a time like this right before the ... they've got the information in July and they wait until September to launch it at the last minute hold up the process it looks a little to\nOrganize and coordinated to well I think that's wrong Democrat Joe we're going to pay heavily with this election coming up this I think you could be right I think a lot of people are turned off at the uh the demeanor you know\nYeah I just I I just didn't even just just shocked me how negative and how they\nHandled it all to for power yeah just just control power yeah and I think it backfired on literally but I think she was set up as a point\nI think Lindsey Graham hit that right on the head when he talked about the uh babbling on his power about I Hope you never got it right or it's about time\nHe finally somebody on the Republican I stood up and told them that's right what the hell they're doing you know absolutely and you know just get it over with and just say it right you know that have been on just sit\nThere and

my mind over this\nMisrepresentation so financial planner stockbrokers and the whole industry out there who's telling you lives but one line specific is that real estate or that stocks are way more profitable than real estate is and this guy I was like southern reasons the main argument\nThat they come up with as you look historically the stock market has progressed at ten percent per year and historically real estate is appreciate the former city or\nThey're just killing everything that we do with real estate we don't buy real estate hole for appreciation\nThat is just not what we do these guys do not understand the thing they're talking about and a real estate investor doesn't buy a piece of real estate and hope it goes up in value hey maybe you bought your home and hope it goes up and die but that's not what investors do and if you're an investor and that's what you're doing that you don't know what you're doing either\nRight so the next when they're talking about is lower transaction costs to go you know you can trade to stock for five dollars go look you could buy stock I make no money at all have no dividends\nRight pay taxes or whatever games you make but by God you can buy that stock for only five dollar trade\nWow that's really impressive or you could buy a piece of real estate that puts out ten to twenty percent twenty five percent sometimes\nA cash flow which is you know the highest casual they'll go out there right now CDs for about two and so I wanted to point nine the other day for a long term like five years a burial liquid and we go back to that liquidity argument very liquid but you know you get a unified receiver two percent\nOr where it's this real estate stuff we shoot for between eight and a Fifteen Percent sometimes you see the deal\nHey maybe you bought your home and hope it goes up and die but that's not what investors do and if you're an investor and that's what you're doing then you don't know what you're doing either right so the next when they're talking about is lower transaction cost to get you know you can trade to stock for five dollars go look you could buy stock I make no money at all have no dividends\nRight pay taxes on whatever gains you make but by God you can buy that stock for only five dollar trade\nWow that's really impressive or you could buy a piece of real estate that puts out ten to twenty percent twenty five percent sometimes\nA cash flow which is you know the highest casual they'll go out there right now CDs for about two I I wanted to point nine the other day for a long term in like five years a burial liquid to me go back to that liquidity argument very a liquid but you know you get a you know five your CD or two percent\nOr where it's this real estate stuff we shoot for between eight and a Fifteen Percent sometimes you see the deals like we bring on all the time but over Fifteen Percent twenty twenty five percent gosh well they don't have any of that we have not only the ... percent appreciation we have forced appreciation and you saw that yesterday where the people were saying they they pulled out\nIn two years I think it was a two hundred and fifty percent return for there are two hundred sixty eight to be exact now if I remember right and uh you don't see that in the stock market there's no two hundred sixty percent return in the stock market so what's the difference if we make\nI think that they said they made until they have like two million and the deal I'm let's just say a million let's say you put a million and a deal and you make two hundred percent with that that'd be two million and now you've got to pay fifty thousand dollars to get out\nOr you could buy some stocks that don't make you anything pay you know the evidence you have to pay taxes on whatever money you might gain if you do have again and you can do that for five dollars\nWow that just doesn't sound like that impressive ... point on seven reasons why stocks are better than real see the third one is it's less work\nWow now how the heck you've come by that the bottom line is if you're going to go pick stocks yourself the amount of research you would have to do with the un godly\nI Know when we were when I was a trading back in the day I'm you know we were reading the newspaper every day all the articles in journals you can listen to all the news you could try to figure out what was the next big play it was a full time job trading stocks\nOr you can handed over to somebody else and let them do it for you which means there's less work\nNow in real estate we're the same thing we can go out there and operate our own business and be a hundred percent involve making a fulltime job or we can hire a management company to manager a business more than just be the acid manager portion of the deal and if we don't even want to be asked manager which is just telling the by telling the management company what our goals are\nWe can become a pass investor and let the lead Beatty asset manager the management company managed the property and the onsite people do the work\nHow can they say that there's less work than none zero we don't have to locate evaluate negotiate contract close finance operate anything\nThat's not less work guys\nThat's more work\nTo go out there and to figure out what all the stocks and bonds and things you want to put yourself enough again you can just blindly to turn it over somebody else with them do it all for you and then there's no working all granted but that's not an argument that makes stocks better than real estate this guy doesn't understand\nWhat the options are whoever this guy is I've never heard of this guy before Sean man you shouldn't be writing articles about stuff you don't understand it just\nI don't know if the rest of you out there irritated by it or not but you know you hear every time you get on the radio or TV you hear the same stuff and what's funny is you know I'm the guy on this radio station here he talked about you know the to the left or the right left or the right now it's not even a left or right it's a left\nTrack close finance operate anything\nThat's not less work guys\nThat's more work\nTo go out there and figure out what all the stocks and bonds and things you want to put yourself in doubt again you can just blindly to turn it over somebody else with them do it all for you and then there's no working all granted but that's not an argument that makes stocks better than real estate this guy doesn't understand\nWhat the options are whoever this guy is I've never heard of this guy before Sean man you shouldn't be writing articles about stuff you don't understand it just\nI don't know if the rest of you out there irritated by it or not but you know you hear every time you get on the radio or TV you hear the same stuff and what's funny is you know I'm\nThe guy on this radio station here he talks about you know the to the left or the right left or the right now it's not even a left or right it's a left and the right they're both spewing the same garbage out day in day out there for some reason\nIt's more diversification they're saying wow\nYou can't own property is how to San Francisco Rio Amsterdam all over the world but if you own stocks you can almost\nDocks at any company in the world again\nThis guy has no idea what he's talking about our members are investing it deals themselves\nInvesting it deals with other people and they're investing deals that had the diversification of different operators the diversification of different locations\nThe diversification of different types of deals in other words a value plays and you'll place and the diversification geographically whether I Want to have my stuff in California I went out much stuff at Florida Atlanta Houston Dallas\nWe have maximum\nMaximum diversification and again this guy has no idea he thinks he can do is buy something right in your own town where you live\nBecause he doesn't know what he's talking about so was my bitch about today my argument is not that these guys are right or wrong they are definitely wrong they cannot put together an argument that proves that they're not wrong that they're right my\nArgument is the kid dispute this stuff on radio and TV and the Internet without anybody being able to come back and argue the point against them they have suffered themselves within their own little zones of mediocrity\nWhy because they make their living selling you this stuff that's why this is how they make a living they don't make a living by picking successful investments they're not investors\nThey don't care if you're stocks go up or down they just care if they get paid they're getting paid what they're stocks go up or down they're getting paid right just crazy stuff the national him which makes no sense at all number five is the ability to invest in products you love\n[noise] [laughter] [laughter] what you care what you invested\nWhat do you care the product you level can we can invest their products we love hey I have a senior citizens property I used to have I loved that I really loved helping senior people we are low income properties oh man I really love helping low income housing people to get a nice clean place to live hey we've got some resorts stuff man I Love owning some resort stuff\nI can invest in the stuff I Love it just so happens what I Love is something real what do I mean by that how would you like to have a boyfriend or girlfriend or a spouse that wasn't real it was just a piece of paper or a computer program\nBecause it's safer because I lost forty percent of my net worth in stocks\nThis guy is so wrong his argument is upside down and silly you wonder how we even gets published\nMaybe he pays to publish his stuff I don't know whatever the number seven fewer taxes and fees are you out of your mind have you totally lost it there's this guy even bother to do any research before he writes something Sean Sean\nCome on John real estate investors when done correctly don't pay any taxes on their income you pay taxes on everything you do every single transaction that you make money and you're paying taxes on\nHow the heck can you say there's less taxes if he's out there say because there's property taxes they don't have property taxes you don't need property taxes because you don't own anything you own a piece of paper\nAnd the only game to get his capital gains and that's all tax bill by the way even if they threw out some evidence that would be taxable but the property

with passive income wow now that leads me to the next article half\n[noise] it's just written by CNBC see NBC up it's an article about Tony Robbins and his feelings about what is a financially secure or you know wealthy person and Tony Robbins talks about the fact that he thinks it\nBeing wealthy is a scene using a ... I see the new rules wealthy I feel safe and secure\nTony Tony Tony you're worth four hundred million bucks I look you up [laughter] you don't feel that you are wealthy\nAnd what you're telling people that if if they could just learn to live with what they have and and he says something like this I'm not going to read the whole world because I didn't even print the whole article said something like if you just learn to appreciate what you already had anything above that becomes wealth you feel wealthy\nNot that many times the only way you feel wealthy is if you're so rich you know to give away and get back\nThere is no given away and give it back for these people donate their barely even making enough money to retire\nYour feeling concept although intellectually makes sense\nYou know we always want how much money one more dollars ... we have right now only plays out for people that have the lack mentality to zero sum game that I have to take a dollar for new for me to have a dollar but in the pundits mentality that we live in everybody can be rich and and I don't\nMean feel rich I mean the the rich\nThat something that you can't even imagine Tony had you had them walking on

get up and go to work all the firewall can you do Tony isn't doing nothing towards helping these people financially because you got them for you and good about their financial situation you have not help them with\nTheir financial situation the article goes on and says here's how we break down whether or not you're wealthy and it comes down to how long could you live if you lost your job tomorrow and he says if you can live only a month you're broke if you only have one to three months you're teetering if you're gonna live three to six months you're satisfactory\nThree to six months or a Bible

I remember it was an August and I'm thinking of a two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on and talking about\nHow people were losing trust in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was the only two groups in and this was before ... and by the way and remember that part of it so whatever that you know a few months before that so they rate\nWhat they're only two institutions that more than half the people in this country had faith in one of which was the military at Seventy some present\nIn what's been happening with Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Ford and all the rest of it and I don't care which sign to that argument Iran first of all if you both firmly believe one side or the other ... you have to realize we don't really have a lot of facts okay\nAnd you can they say will then that means ... that means y understand all that\nBut real lined the total lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and it will have consequences for the market and as I mentioned\nI have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay but I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if they're right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just\nTotal lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and it will have consequences for the market

bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just 'cause I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the class I'm going to be teaching is before the crash and the ideas is classes and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is\nBefore the market goes down you gotta know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up\nBut the average retail trade or will never make money and the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I've given us a lot of thought to about you know people keep coming in and told me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors will define investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realize that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble they put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong\nAnd again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is is that when the market turns down can turn down very quickly if you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of games think about this from it Thirteen Years of games in a year and a half okay\nIf you lost Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now\nHow is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down then you can on the move up so getting class we're gonna talk about all these ideas we're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people focus on what's called technical analysis using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked with are like four okay you know you have your ... to ... and your are your uh see the eyes and ears of all the thousands or hundreds of these things right\nSo how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different links and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got they won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of the guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared and so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month and\nAnd your are your uh see the eyes and ears and all the thousands or hundreds of these things right so how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one and within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got they won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecast is really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now\nAnd the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes [laughter] and that's a lot of this is that people use something because it's the best they think they've got but it's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things to really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market to supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make there's a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but we always make sure that when we're wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing\nAs opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do so again if you want to come out to a class I'm going to be teaching this one personally\nWhen you come out if you if you win ticket you'll get to free tickets you'll get a free tablet when you come out plus we will feed you lunch so if

at risk of changing pretty quickly so that the class I'm going to be teaching and and by the way it totally aside from that there's some other things out there right now that indicate that the market may well be near the top\nAnd I'm really getting into to those ideas and just a couple of minutes but the to me the key is you\nTo know what to do before things go bad if you wait till they go bad is it happens way too fast and you can't react and time you've got to be position before it happens now when the markets falls I mentioned the market when it fell in two thousand eight two thousand nine the market and the U.S and the gay backs Thirteen Years of profits in a year and a half\nThat's how fast these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to

it's thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years\nAnd you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside that's very very hard for people to achieve their goals\nSo we're going to be talking about how do we identify the prices would you begin to tuitions like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at you know when he was

an apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics of how I don't want to actually make money when the stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is that they invest in stocks because they think they're safe stocks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into because their markets only open six and a half hours a day Seventeen and a half hours of every day and forty eight hours of every weekend you cannot protect yourself\nYes you can use options to limit your losses but\nYou're still going to have launches okay if you had homeowner's insurance and it only

market and why I think we're closer to the top than the bottom at this point by a very long way and in fact why you may see a top in this market pretty soon\nYou know early this year I said I thought you'd see the top this year and we don't we haven't really gone much above where we were in January kind of gone back and forth around there\nYou know I said we could have one more run this year and you could look anything's possible you could even get a bit of a run next year\nBut what's going to keep taking this market higher and in the last segment I told you a little bit about what I see as evidence of the top in the market one is the fact that more companies are going public selling shares initial public offering to ... cattle\nMore companies that have no profits\nEver in history so Wall Street journal today to the eighty three percent of the company's going public right now have an earnings are gone public the last twelve months no earnings in two thousand the height of the dot com it was eighty one percent so that again is kind of big bubbly sign\nNext big bubbly sign that the fact that you go to a place like Charles Schwab where it's retail traders not professionals okay they have their customers have less cash sitting on the sidelines than they've had at I think it anytime and history of member correct\nBut they don't have a lot of extra money now you combine that with something else we've talked about before on the show which is what's called margin debt\nRight now in this country people are barred about six hundred and sixty billion dollars to buy stock that's about three and a quarter percent of gross domestic product the entire US Economy\nSo what's happening is people are taking the money they have been buying stock because most people are massively behind the eight ball\nYou know and so I stay on the other day that if you look at people even in their sixties\nThe average person has something like a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and assets okay hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars is going to get you anywhere it with all due respect in retirement to really get to where most people need to be you're talking
